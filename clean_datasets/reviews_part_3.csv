review
Nouakchott to Tunis with Tunisair. Aircraft late departing. The aircraft was filthy and seat broken. No inflight entertainment soiled and tattered inflight magazine. Food tasteless. Make cabin crew indifferent service almost arrogant No safety demo no seat belt check. Will avoid in future.
Delhi to Almaty. Great airline and service no complaints. The staff was courteous and helpful. New planes overall a solid experience highly recommended.
Business class from Shanghai to London. It was the worst business class. Staff give the impression that they are above service and I did not feel that they were courteous or polite. On one occasion I asked for a glass of champagne and never got one on another occasion when I dropped my fork for the meal and buzzed for another one no one came when I tried to grab the attention of the staff member walking past he said sorry sir Ill be right with you and never came. Eventually I just went to the back and grabbed one. I would never fly BA again for the money you pay you can get much better business class and value from other airlines.
Just came back this morning on a flight from Dubai BA106. I was not impressed. The cabin crew were just not friendly or helpful. The plane was very old and so were the crew tired and old. It look like they had just got the bad bunch of hostesses to manage this flight. BA was so particular before whats happened The cabin was very hot and several times my wife asked about it and she was just ignored. The food was very quickly given out many of times people were missed. I have to ask for water a number of times. There was no genuine warmth. It was really like flying on a 3 class air lines. Id love to fly BA and support them but this is appalling. I would not recommended this Next time we are flying eremites. Pay the extra. BTW I noticed a number of other people have complained about this crew on the site too seems consistently bad.
Again the flight was delayed and again the captain couldnt issue the usual polite apology for the delay. After some time he laughingly told us Bangkok airport is busy Hardly a professional way of dealing with a delay. In my section there was one pleasant female attendant and one bizarre male attendant who gesticulated a lot when I asked him to take my empty cup as he passed. Emirates provides a very shabby experience in my opinion. A few aspects are okay and others are below expectations. A really professional approach is lacking in their customer service.
Unfortunately having a terrible experience with this airline. I work in the travel industry in Australia and the communication with the staff has been awful. Slow to respond if ever and avoiding the refund of my tickets. The issue has been ongoing for 4 months now before the Corona Virus was even a major issue. I booked online which in their policies says you can get a refund. I normally am super positive and like to support the travel industry in as many ways possible however my experience here has been nothing but terrible. The airline still holds 2600 of my money after acknowledging they would refund me. They are just delaying the process. Will not be recommending Vietnam Airlines to any of my clients travelling to Asia. They may have got 2600 out of me but they will lose so much more business moving forward due to the way they are handling their clients in times of crises. I was sympathetic and very patient with them but now when I require a little bit back from them even just an email of communication it is ignored. Poor form VN.
We flew Air India on March 31st. Ground crew at Vancouver she is very nice and friendly. However the aircraft is too old. Seat armrests are broken and entertainment are not working. I could not even charge our devices. But the flight attendants specifically Chodden and Anisha are friendly they made sure that our kids were entertained while on flight. I dont think we will be flying Air India in our future travel.
I was travelling from Baltimore to London via Keflavik on the 18th Aug 2018. I was waiting in the queue for almost 45 min and was noticing what was going on at the check in counters. When we went for check in first of all staff was not polite at all and she was very difficult with us. She made us put all our hand luggage into the measuring stand despite us telling her that these were checked on our arrival flight from London and are the same ones. Extremely disappointed. We spent almost 5000 on tickets with wow air and this is the treatment we get.
Doha to Chicago on 30th April. Evasive phone numbers and no customer service email address Their policy states that if a flight is set back more than 3 hours other than weather or an act of God you will be refunded. After having to offload and reboard a second plane totalling nearly 4 hours one would think youd be compensated. Especially after missing the next flight and setting me back another 9 hours. After countless hours trying to get someone that will actually listen you hear the words we are not responsible nor refundable. The rudeness and evasive accountability is astounding.
IguazuBuenos Aires in an A320 operated by LAN Argentina. Quick and efficient checkin. The seat had a lot of legroom and was quite comfortable. A small snack of biscuits and a drink was served the service was a little brusque. The plane operated right on time and baggage came to the carousel quite quickly.
Maun to Johannesburg. What a terrible experience. The plane was in disarray dirty. The cabin staff were dishevelled not serious. I will never fly Air Botswana again
Ive always enjoyed flying ANA on its international routes and Im happy to report that the domestic route I flew was up to the same high standards of service. A very early red eye flight cheap ticket but a very clean well maintained looking interior to the aircraft. No food served but the flight attendants were very friendly and helpful without being either overly intrusive or noticeably absent. Seats were comfortable decent enough legroom that I didnt feel cramped on the 3 hour flight as well which was a bonus as squeezing my six foot frame into some previous airlines cabins has been torturous. No personal screens for entertainment but there were radio channels available and I always travel with a book so I was quite content. Got me where I wanted to go with no fuss and a totally uneventful journey. Thanks
Istanbul to Moscow. Convenient time charter flight from Istanbul to Moscow. Low airfare within the size of hand luggage water and inflight magazine on board for everyone.
Melbourne to Lahore return via Dubai. All sectors operated by Boeing 777300ER. Check in Melbourne was good. Lahore was chaotic. Lounges in MEL and DXB the usual EK lounges. However the contract lounge used by EK in LHE needs to be reviewed. CIP Lounge is dirty damp corrupt staff stale food etc. LHEDXB sector was operated by a dated Boeing 777300ER. Rest of the sectors were ok. Cabin crew on board were a hit and missed and lacked consistency in quality. Food on board was very bad. Cabin Crew and Food has been on a downward spiral out of control over the years and there does not seem to be any appetite from management to improve service. This being said flights were reasonably close to time and IFE was not bad. Emirates is slipping and it has become obvious.
Denpasar to Jakarta. I picked Lion Air because it was the cheapest of all budget airlines compared to Air Asia Citilink etc. The flight was delayed by 1.5 hour and another 30 minutes delay on flight. Apparently this is a regular thing to happen according to my other flight. The onboard experience was not pleasant. The seatbelt that I have was broken so it couldnt lock which is very dangerous. The washroom is not well taken care of. The toilet seat was broken and the soap container was extremely dirty. The flight attendant are ok. The seats are ok. There werent any in flight entertainment only the security procedure pamphlet if you can find it entertaining thats good For the price difference of 20 dollar it was not worth the flight. So I would rather choose other better budget airlines.
London City to Nantes. Generous complimentary food and drink service comfortable Fokker 50 and swift check in at London City. Only negative point is that the windows on the Fokker 50 seem to have been designed only for children to look through Im of average height and they were far too low for me to see through without straining my back.
London to Harare via Johannesburg. Depart Heathrow on time plane full to Johannesburg no spare seats. Served dinner then breakfast both of which were standard fare. Landed in Johannesburg on time then bussed to remote stand in Joburg flight to Harare again plane full served a hot brunch type meal and arrived on time. Cabin crews on both flights seemed efficient. Return flight from Harare to Johannesburg again full SAA seem to fill their flights and yet manage to serve a meal on the 90 minute hop from Harare to Johannesburg. Johannesburg to London on another totally full flight despite online booking and seat selection I was allocated a middle seat complained at check in and ended up in an aisle seat at the back of the plane. Departed on time and evening meal served a sort of tepid beef stew after which all the blinds came down and lights turned off announcement was so that we can unwind and relax but on the outward flight same procedure of blinds down for security reasons translated these both mean dont bother the crew. Seats are hard and narrow so sleep is difficult. Breakfast served before arrival. To be fair they provide meals instead of cereal bars etc and this is appreciated .
Amman to London. The staff is reckless when it comes to safety of passengers. When In the plane Near to me there was a woman with 2 kids. During take off one of the kids was sleeping on the floor without fasten seat belt. The staff walked near by us saw the child and did not encourage the mother to take safety measure and protect the child. I flew with my 5 members family. They didnt put us together they placed all the family all over the plane. I had to ask the crew staff at least to keep the 6 years old daughter with her mum which they were hardly able to do.
Flew AlicanteLuton. Check in a breeze at Alicante and boarding was very quick. We took off 10 minutes early from Alicante which was great. Flight itself was full on an A321 and service was good as always. Cabin crew very friendly and captain kept us informed at all times. Great flight looking forward to the return.
Seoul to Manila a 3.5 hr flight. The A330300 was archaic horrible 1st generation shell seats. This is the same seat that is on the Boeing 747400 simply awful narrow making it impossible to sleep on your side. IFE was virtually nonexistent. Food was marginal. Service was okay.
I left my iPhone in the check in kiosk. My husband and I were being helped by Tan who retagged our bags and was so helpful. Once I was through security I realized Id left my phone on the checkin kiosk. I made my way back to Tiger checkin but no phone. Staff was extremely sympathetic and helpful. I then visited airport security also helpful. They sent me to the TigerAir main desk. Two women there contacted Tan personally and he had found my phone and told them exactly where hed secured it. Back to Tiger Air checkin and they had my iPhone. I was so grateful I cried. To a person everyone at Tiger Air was concerned and helpful Thank you from a forgetful American.
My flight to Cairo via Riyadh from Delhi got delayed by 11 hours. However I was only intimated for the first sector a night prior. There was no reply on emails no proper response on fb messenger from them when I kept asking them for RiyadhCairo flight. It was on the date of my flight when I had a callback and they said they cannot accommodate me on the connecting flight. My flight was at 3 PM and I was on phone sitting at my home at 11 AM discussing what will happen to my flight. They gave me an option to reschedule my whole flight. My flight was on 25th and the reschedule date they gave me was on 27th Dec. I had spent money on my vacation taken leave from my office. Pathetic customer service as they only have international customer care number. People working there are equally pathetic. I will not recommend this airline to anyone. I finally cancelled my flight and now waiting for refund.
Bali to Surabaya via Lombok. Lion air first duplicated my familys boarding passes. The flight was overbooked. They then allowed me off the plane to query why and immediately locked the doors behind me. My understanding is that as an air safety rule planes are not allowed to leave with baggage without the passengers. Lion air was not concerned. Half an hour later I was still waiting for someone to advise me as to what my next steps are. It was suggested that I buy more tickets. This is really poor and not really acceptable.
I flew out on the 8th June 2015 and all I can say is that the staff flight and service was excellent. We had a little issue with the flights as the people we booked it with made an error on our tickets but BA sorted this out in no time. I will definitely be flying out with them again and I will recommend them. Service on the plane was excellent.
Los Angeles to Frankfurt via Keflavik. This is the worst airline in the world. Plane was late 5 hrs. Give you 5 for food at the airport for a 9hr flight. From five hours turned out to be one day in Reykjavik due to cancellation of the flightno food or water provided. For hot water they wanted to charge me. After the one day delay the next plane arrived 11hr late at the destination. I missed my flight. They said they can do nothing about it sorry have a great flight . Had to spent another 300 Euro to buy ticket for the missed flight myself and find my own accommodation in Germany. After placing complaint online automatic response. On the second flight to my destination from Reykjavik they charged me 70 euro. I have no CC so they told me I have to come up with exact cash cause they dont have change. I had to run around the Airport to see if some place would give me change Otherwise I am not allowed on the plane. The lady who sold me the ticket before me getting on the plane asked me if I paid for the ticket. If you need anything you gotta call India customer service cause WOW doesnt have headquarters anywhere not even in Iceland. When you call they tell you Im sorry we have to follow the rules you can place a complaint.
ArkhangelskARH to TromsoeTOS with a stop in MurmanskMMK. Fast and easy checkin and boarding. Decently comfortable and rapid security check. Aircraft Antonov 24 has seen better days but was OK for a short flight. Cabin crew polite and professional. Got served drinks on the first leg to Murmansk then snacks selection of meats with bread and piclkes on the way from Murmansk to Tromsoe. Departure and arrival according to the timetable. Luggage arrived OK. Overall experience fine apart from the high price.
Madrid to Tokyo via Hong Kong. Friendly staff seat on the A350 is great to loungeeat and even sleep. On 777 bit less so and more chaotic and economy class meal. A350 to Hong Kong premium meal which was nothing to complain about. Enough snacks and drinks during the flight. PE well worth the money.
Luggage payment was not included in the ticket price. I had to pay extra 75 CAD at each airport. None of them accepted cash. In Toronto the payment machine did not recognise my Visa card. I was sent to another counter where they issued a card with 75 dollars in it plus 9 CAD for the service. In Sofia the card worked but instead of 101 units in local currency I was charged 101 CAD I lost another 26 dollars. One may say 35 dollars lost is not a big deal. True but the problem is with the nerves. On top of the stress with checking in security check and wasting time you must be at the airport 3 hours before the departure time and departure was late by a whole hour comes the stupid requirement to pay separately for the luggage. Not online or within the ticket price but at the airport. Never again Lufthansa.
First time I travelled through this airline aircraft are too small dirty seats no multimedia. And while returning from Istanbul they lost my luggage which I get after one day. The problem is their mismanagement at Jed airport almost 30 passengers luggage was missed and there was no one at airport to log the complaints. We have to wait 3 hours to complete the process. And once luggage arrived at airport they didnt even call me. I just roamed around at airport and luckily found my luggage.
We were originally scheduled to fly SFODOHMEL however due to Australian passenger arrival caps the DOHMEL sector was cancelled and QR offered to reroute us into BNE two days after our original departure date. This was sincerely appreciated particularly given our experience with other carriers flying into Australia who cancelled close to departure without any help in rescheduling or rerouting. As always the QR experience was top notch. The QSuite and bedding were extremely comfortable food very good wine list outstanding and cabin crew service exemplary. Checkin and transit in Doha were seamless. I was a big fan of QR before this experience however the way in which they handled our reaccommodated into Brisbane has now earned them my loyalty. A stark contrast to other carriers flying into Australia during the pandemic.
Mumbai to Srinagar via Delhi. Selected the flight due to least trouble of not changing the plane at Delhi and paid extra fare for seat selection. It was good till we landed at Delhi. There I was handed a new boarding pass and was made to run from one plane to another boarding gate undergoing the security once again. The airline had changed the flight and even changed the seat as per their choice without a word of sorry.
Upon checking in at the Rex Airlines counter at Sydney airport I received exceptional and thoughtful service from Jorja. I have a pacemaker and Jorja took the time to assist me by walking me to the appropriate security section and making sure I was taken care of by security staff. I found Jorjas assistance invaluable and nothing was a problem for her. Jorja showed not only professionalism but also a kind caring approach to my needs. I will not forget her kindness. What a wonderful approach to old fashioned customer service.
Flew Air Seychelles from Seychelles to Mauritius had to take this as this would be the only direct option with a high price of 300 and this became my worst flight experience in my life as my original departure time of Apr. 19 1000 eventually became Apr. 20 1510. A transactional email arrives the night before the flight that the flight will be delayed but new flight time will be released later on shattering my sleep already as I am in fear that my travel plans will be disrupted and it did in a serious manner. Had to be at the airport on time nonetheless as I now know that Air Seychelles will never care about my travel plans and therefore I will have to be at the airport to be at the scene myself and another email arrives that 1320 would be the new departure time. But then nothing happens and nobody at the checkin counter knows what is going on except that there is a discussion about the flights fate if it would fly out on 1320 as planned or not and it did not. Finally at around 1100 an Air Seychelles temporary employee approaches the passengers that the flight is decided to be delayed a quick check on its two A320 Neos reveal that they are flying other routes instead but no explanations were given at all so how would I know what is happening at all and that all passengers will have to stay where Air Seychelles sends them to. All passengers end up taking the bus provided by Air Seychelles after loading their luggage on an open trucks cargo hold and are all bussed to a terrible resort about 30 minutes away from the airport. Then rooms were assigned arbitrarily couples were okay but solo travelers were randomly assigned rooms together and a terrible lunch buffet with only one free nonalcoholic beverage was offered not even a meal voucher as that would be so much more expensive to the airline. Then we were told by Air Seychelles that the flight could depart any time that day or the day after and that the passengers should wait for the call in their hotel rooms that is someone should be in the hotel room instead of being at the beach in front of the resort as well as frequently consult Air Seychelles Facebook page for updates. Then the hotel calls that passengers should gather by 1100 the next morning without even telling us what the new departure time would be had to check myself via the aforementioned Facebook page that the new departure time had been announced as Apr. 20 1510. Then the next morning once again the weird bussing back from the hotel to the airport and then found out that an Ethiopian B737MAX8 was there to run the route instead. Checkedin and finally departed at around 1540 landing in Mauritius at around 1800 a whopping 30 hour delay. Cannot say much about the aircraft and inflight service as it was provided by Ethiopian Airlines but it was pretty basic with basic seats without any IFE and a tiny sandwich given during the flight alcoholic beverages were available though. At the end of the day my Mauritius travel plans were disrupted without any reimbursement of any kind from the airline for the losses. I heard before that Air Seychelles had financial troubles in the past and now I think understand why. Will never fly again with Air Seychelles and even give up Seychelles as my vacation destination if Air Seychelles is unavoidable.
Refund not given against cancelled flight by Airline. I have booked roundtrip ticket from Kunming to Delhi and Delhi to kunming but Shandong Airline not allowed to travel my daughter due to surname printed on booked ticket. This ticket was booked wrong by Travel agency. Shandong Airline didnt any help me.Travel agency refuse to refund against cancelled flight this is totally unacceptable.
Passengers and crew not wearing their masks properly. Crew removed mask to shout in the middle of the airplane. Unacceptable behavior. Avoid at all cost.
Paris to Sofia. As a person who is travelling a lot I dont recommend Air France. They dont care about your baggage. I received my suitcase ripped. I asked for compensation but their policy is so complicated so I gave up. They ask for so many things to be provided that I will lose so much time.
Hong Kong to New York JFK. The economy cabin had rows of seats 3 x 4 x 3. It felt cramped. Service was satisfactory. A large library of films was available for viewing decent headsets were in the seat pocket. On the seat itself were a blanket and pillow and the seat reclined sufficiently. A menu card was distributed. Lunch and dinner were served and in between in the galley area a wide selection of snacks nonalcoholic beverages eyeshades and socks were laid out. Bathrooms remained clean during this long flight. Flight attendants were efficient. Dutyfree products were hawked but there was really nothing to buy from the catalogue on a flight to the US Departure and arrival were on time. At the boarding gate passengers were subject to additional security screening. The biggest drawback to the economy seats is obviously the tightness of space including storage space around you overhead bins are spacious on the 777300 and the total lack of privacy. Just turning on the overhead lamp to read a book lights up the entire row. Overall however Cathay Pacific does well to ensure that economy class passengers have decent travel experience. We arrived in Terminal 8. Disembarkation was quick.
The business class experience was good. The amenities are impeccable and the FAs services were personal and warm. The Qsuite lived up to its expectation.
Dubai to London. Emirates has to follow international standards. We were delayed for 45 minutes. Not a single explanation or word of apology was given by the captain. This is unacceptable. We arrived in London 22 minutes late and not a word of comment. Just Its a nice sunny morning in London. This approach to ignoring the delay is absurd. Do they think if they say nothing the problem doesnt exist. Emirates has to learn how to be punctual or learn how to apologise for delays.
Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. The flight got delayed because of a lengthy Deicing process. Service was friendly for a very short flight just drinks and snacks. Landing in LAX was very smooth and luggage delivered on time but the American Eagle terminal is uncomfortably distant from the main terminal in LAX.
Fake advertisement of the ability to purchase additional baggage. 15 euros per kg. When I had originally purchased the ticket it was made clear on the website that I would be able to purchase additional baggage. Today I was trying to complete my checkin and purchase the extra luggage however the website did not allow this option I therefore rung the contact number available on the website to make the purchase and to my surprise was told that I could purchase the extra baggage only once I arrive at the airport only after questioning the lady on the phone I was told that in fact I could not take an extra suitcase but only pay for extra kilos in the luggage which I already have 15 per kilo from the suitcase I already have. Unfortunately I have already brought and paid for an extra suitcase from London to Lisbon with the expectation that I would be able to take it to Cape Verde. Im highly disappointed with the service I have received thus far I usually take this trip with TAP however decided to try something new and now I am being charged an additional 450 for a suitcase. This was extremely unclear across the website and now I have no choice but to throw away my suitcase with all my belongings as the price of this was not advertised.
Perth to Fukuoka via Tokyo. I would like to convey my deepest gratitude to the ANA ground staff supervisors in the check in desk areas at Perth International Airport. Before I could check in I realised that I had accidentally left my mobile phone inside the car that dropped me off and I had no way of contacting them to retrieve my phone. In my distress I turned to the first airport staff I met and they happened to be the ANA checkin supervisors. I had asked them on what I should do whether I should check in first or try to retrieve my phone. Instead of providing me a textbook answer or redirecting me to the airport information desk she offered for me to use her own mobile phone to call my family. I was shocked and deeply grateful. I had to make multiple calls on multiple phone numbers. But she remained She even continued to help me call my family as I checked in. They were patient calm and immensely helpful. In the end I was able to retrieve my mobile phone. I am so grateful for the superb customer service. This is true service serving with their hearts. 110 recommend. Will definitely fly ANA again
Miami to London Business Class. Living in London and flying international long haul flights throughout the year I have once again been disappointed by British Airways poor maintenance for premium amenities in preferred cabins. Our family of four were travelling home from the Christmas holidays on an overnight flight and when I was ready to sleep I attempted to recline my seat in the flat bed position. My seat would not recline. The flight was completely full and there were no other seats available to switch me to. These are simple checks a maintenance crew could and should go through prior to boarding an aircraft. I notified the flight attendant to see if he had any knowledge as to how the seat could be adjusted in an attempt to fix it. Sadly he did not. I was informed that the headpurser was on his crew rest and that he would come discuss the situation with me in an hour and a half. Hopefully his accommodations were better than mine. Prior to landing 20 minutes before on a 9 hour flight the purser spoke to me and apologised on behalf of BA and said he could compensate me with either 50 or 10000 Avios. I informed him there was a far greater price point between Premium Economy vs. Business Class. Understandably he apologised and said that was all he was capable of doing. I received a call from a BA representative and I was informed that she could only provide me with similar compensation 50 or 10000 Avios. I currently have 588500 avois on BA that is nearly impossible to use. I requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight from Heathrow to Atlanta from a Premium Economy seat to a Business Class seat. The BA representative said that she could not do this as customers pay for the Business Class experience the food individual flight attendant service and comfort. Sleeping is the entire point of purchasing a Business Class seat not the food. My comfort was not met. The flight attendants on BA have always been very professional irregardless of the cabin the point was to sleep.
Islamabad to Manchester. Very prompt check in for Shaheen Air. No hassle. Boarding very professional and well organised. Friendly cabin staff. Clean very aircraft. Good quality food served lunch Asian style and evening dinner European style and plenty of cold drinks coffee tea. Little treats like chocolates also served during flight. Food served on time and promptly. This flight had free Wifi which worked well. Generally very happy with Shaheen Air. I would definitely recommend and I would fly again with them.
London to Singapore via Dubai. Ive flown most major airlines and Emirates wins hand down. Ive flown with them on business and first and the service is incredible. The crew look after you and go above and beyond. Special thanks to air hostess Alix so attentive and professional. Cabin was spotless and very comfortable. Fantastic work Emirates keep it up.
British Airways from Antigua to Gatwick. A shabby aircraft my seat was broken it would recline without command the head rest was broken and the seat covers were very worn. The inflight entertainment had to be re set as it wasnt working and when it did work my screen did not display the safety briefing images would freeze in effect I did not receive the briefing. The cabin staff refused to dispose of my wifes drink because it was not finished I had to request another hostess to take it. The food was poor quality in general too looked like a kids meals pasta with cheese. Check in was good queues were long but the staff were very helpful and the flight left on time. British Airways is not in the league of other long haul carriers like Emirates a lot of work to be done to refresh its image.
Gatwick to Guernsey. Couldnt check in online as we had bags and a child which the system doesnt cater for but no queue at the Gatwick check in and the process completed in a couple of minutes. Flight on time. Free soft drinks and teacoffee and a copy of the local paper was a nice touch. Brand new ATR72 spotless On arrival we waited just 5 minutes for our bags. On the return again no queue at check in on time and comfortable. Excellent value for money.
Moscow Vienna. Nice flight. Ive already used S7 for domestic flights so decided to fly with them internationally and I was pretty satisfied by the whole trip. The aircraft were fine. I guess it was A319 for both ways. There was enough space for the legs in the economy seats my height is 1.84m and both planes looked new. Lunch was not very big but tasty enough. The choice of beverages was a bit limited. What I find important all the flights were on time. The workers in airport and on board made they job quickly and professional.
Our flight was scheduled to leave at 910AM. We arrived at 810AM and the attendant told us they had already closed the computer terminal and couldnt print our boarding tickets 3 people. I asked them to put us in the next flight. They told me they couldnt do it because I bought the tickets via Booking.com. That I had to buy new tickets. Which I ended up doing because We had reservations at Flores for Tikal and hotel reservations. They even made pay a higher price than with Booking.com. It was an ordeal because the new tickets I had to buy them through a phone call because they many staff working told me they couldnt help me. What Tag airline did was a robbery.
Singapore to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Devil is in details. Steward would not help put carry on above the seat. Singapore Airlines allows 30 kg Cathay Pacific only allows 20kg and just made to pay 130 SIN dollars for excess. The staff could not care less if you are unhappy.
I have traveled Surinam Airways 3 times and none of those times we departed on time. The service on board is good though and they serve a hot meal at least. I fly most of the time from Aruba to Miami but instead of leaving at 11 am we departed 8pm The other day supposed to leave Miami around 3.30 pm instead we left around 1 am. We spent 13 hours at Miami international they provided us with a 10 voucher for food. Unacceptable.
Toronto to Montego Bay. Terrible airline and wont fly with them again. Tickets and website say you can check in online but it wasnt working when I tried. No option to check in or choose seats. They warn you that tickets will have to be printed no electronic tickets. In this electronic age this just isnt acceptable. We live 2hrs from the airport so leave early not knowing what the weatherdrive would be like. I had downloaded the Sunwing app and also signed up for alerts from Pearson Airport. As we arrived at the airport I got notification from Pearson that our flight was delayed an hour but nothing from Sunwing. We couldnt check in at the kiosks and had to go to the desk where I got attitude from the agent. Sunwing is supposed to fly out of Terminal 3 but we find out that we actually have to take a shuttle from T3 to infield concourse. Basically no mans land. We check it out and are told by staff not to go over until 1 hr before our flight because its small and doesnt have much there. Sounds logical. We find out at that point that our flight is further delayed another hour. In talking to others at the airport on the way home we find out there were 20 vouchers provided for the late flight from Toronto but it was only announced once in the infield concourse. So we didnt hear it because we were in the main terminal as we were told to stay there. As it was the only options to spend the 20 vouchers was overpriced junk food and grab and go because there are no other food options at the infield concourse. When we finally depart its over 2 hrs from our original flight time. Seats are uncomfortable and lacking in padding. In flight entertainment consists of reruns of sitcoms. We arrive in Montego Bay very late.... and our checked baggage is no where to be found. There were at least 5 others who also did not receive their luggage. The attendant in MB was in no hurry to help even though it was late and people were frustrated. He would only help one person at a time. We did eventually get our luggage late the next day. A horrible start to our vacation. On the way back to home our flight was also late leaving but no info provided at all. The flight wasnt full but the seating didnt make any sense. Some rows had 2 people crammed in them while others only had 1 person on in them. The flight attendants wouldnt let people change seats. Back to no mans land and onto a shuttle bus back to T3. Its clear that Sunwing is an out of date airline who has been exiled from the mainstream operations at Pearson.
Flew SmartWings from London Gatwick to Prague. Absolutely atrocious do not fly this airline. I was due to fly for a holiday over the easter break. When I got to the airport they put me on standby. Then the plane was delayed by four hours. Then I was refused boarding due to overbooking. Have been trying to claim compensation but the claim form on their website doesnt work and no one replies to the emails.
Afriqiyah Airways customer service is nonexistent. I travelled from London via Tripoli to Cameroon last December. I lost my luggage I am still to be compensated and nobody seem to care. I will think twice before travelling again with this airline.
Washington to Hong Kong. An excellent flight we boarded the flight late at night and took off ten minutes later than schedule but with nice tail winds we arrived an hour early. The seats where superb designed by Porsche to give maximum comfort the entertainment system was amazing with a great mixture of box office hits and some classics the food was good I loved the leek soup and unfortunately I could not get the continental breakfast but no one can deliver perfection. The WiFi was very good provided by Panasonic and was quite reliable.
I chose Easyjet only because I needed to fly from Gatwick to Berlin. This is the second time I have flown with Easy jet and both times have been great Ticket price came with Speedy Boarding not sure how many are allocated each flight. This flight seem to have quite a few. I live in Australia so we dont have this. Once onboard lovely crew and comfortable seats. Flight left and arrived on time. Check in quick and efficient. Will certainly fly with Easyjet again.
Las Vegas to Toronto. Very rude staff. No snacks offered. Asked for water twice half hour later no one brought it. When asked for the third time they started giving attitude like its our fault. The plane was half full yet they lied saying it overfilled and people need to check in their carry on. Plane was delayed. The board information was not updated until the last second. Will never fly Air Canada again.
London to Gothenburg. BA are getting a lot of bad press deservedly so at present with strikes IT glitches baggage problems. However extreme cases will always be highlighted. Two recent flights on BA and very happy with them. Flight to Gothenburg on A319100 pushed back 25m late due to a potential technical issue soon resolved and arrived at GOT only 15m behind schedule. Good crew and the Safety Announcement video was a hoot. Return to LHR on A320232. On time departure and early arrival at T5. Again good crew. Will be flying with BA again in December strikes permitting. Still recommended by me as the National Carrier.
Istanbul to Hamburg. I ordered a gluten free meal. I was given a bulgur meal containing wheat. I warned this is not a gluten free meal but they insisted on serving this meal. I didnt want to eat this meal because it contains gluten. When I reported this situation as a complaint to Turkish Airlines they said that it was normal.
Canceled flights after making everyone wait both in the boarded plane that wasnt moving for 4 hours with AC off took us off and told us to wait 4 hours later they canceled the flight and did not give us food or a place to stay until the next available flight all the ones for the rest of the evening were already booked.
Saskatoon to Punta Cana. Old plane cramped space in flight entertainment was a few episodes of Big Bang Theory and Fresh Prince of Bel Aire Put screens in each headrest and lose a row of seats. The food is pretty blah and on the way back they took a detour for more fuel because they accidentally overloaded the plane. Added about 3 hours to the flight. The Dominican Republic charges 20 US only payable in cash to leave the country reputable airlines include it in the price so you dont have to scramble to the extortion oops I mean currency exchange while an entire jet has to wait for you. Spend a bit more and have a nice flight with someone else.
The first part from Brussels to London Heathrow was a fast flight however on the ground in London the problems started. The gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for 40 minutes. The captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous. Continental breakfast in business was OK for this short flight. Flight to Larnaca was full embarkation was prompt for business pax. The team was very friendly. The service started with a drink and some cookies the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser. It must be said the meal was an improvement since last year. Decent drinks and a good Champagne were available followed by coffee or tea. It is a longer flight a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks.
Kuwait to Kochi. The aircraft was not too old or may be a new one. The flight departed on time from the Kuwait Airways dedicated new terminal no 4. Cabin crew was very attentive Food Beverage good. In business class the seat was not flat bed. Overall flight experience was very good but the ground services was very poor.
I arrived at the new beautiful North Goa airport and headed to check in counter. Long queues for the various airlines but no one was in the Akasa queue. I approached smiling customer service representatives who took my two pieces of luggage I had prepaid for 15 kg extra luggage because I was flying internationally They weighed them handed me my boarding pass and said have a nice flight. I have never experienced such an easy check in. Boarding was seamless. They boarded back of the plane first. Plane was full but didnt take long to board. The plane was impeccably spotless and spacious. Would definitely fly with them again. It took literally one hour from my house to the airport thru check in and security and to the terminal
Very bad in future will never fly and would never recommend to anyone. Even though we are on time for connecting flights they had cancelled our seats on connection flight anticipating a delay from primary flight and were made to wait at the counter without proper answers without food or water on the floor for 7 hours. The service people took our boarding passes and misbehaved with people. They would vanish from the counter and return after hours and would not give answers. We were treated as we animals without proper seating without food and water and when we asked for some water they would straight away refuse.
Flew Jakarta to Tokyo Haneda with my family on the 23.40pm on GA874. Garuda had arranged a pick up from my home to the airport and two ground support staff where waiting at check in to assist when we arrived. Check in was very quick and we were then assisted through immigration and into the lounge. When time came for boarding the Ground support team were on hand to help and assist us. The ground service team were so helpful all the way from following up with pick up driver check in support assistance through immigration and boarding the flight. The service was exceptional therefore I would like to thank Rebecca and her team who are really dedicated to ensuring that their passengers are well looked after. As it was over night flight we all went to sleep however prior to bedding down the cabin crew came around and took our meal section for breakfast. They started serving breakfast approx. 1.5 hours prior to landing. The selection of food was excellent and was very well presented. My young daughter woke up late however the on board chef prepared some hot food to take away as we had a connecting flight and she could eat in the lounge. We landed in Haneda on schedule and we were met by the Haneda Garuda ground support team who helped and assisted us through immigration and check in for our onward flight. Overall it was a great trip due to the outstanding 5 Star service from the Cabin Crew and Ground support teams.
Airline offers cheap flights but then gets additional income at the airport. We had to prove our departure at the checkin counter and showed the reservation confirmation for the sailing tour to Colombia. The provider was rejected by them and we were immediately recommended to simply buy a bus ticket for a bus that we will not take. I strongly assume that not only Tica Bus will benefit from the income. Otherwise I wouldnt know why an airport employee who is supposed to document entry and exit recommends a fake bus ticket. Isnt it the employees job to document the length of stay and the exact date of departure So lousy scam or incompetent staff
Lucky enough to fly Qatar Qsuite from London and Adelaide and back and this review encompasses both. Overall superb. Qatar staff all good at London Doha and Adelaide. Prompt and efficient. Doha was unexpectedly good with airbridge disembarkation and helpful ground staff to point you in the right direction. London Qatar lounge good Al Mourjan Business lounge in Doha very good and Qantas Lounge in Adelaide also very good. Upgraded to Al Safwa First Lounge on the way back which was something else. Ensuite bedroom included so actually cheaper than a layover hotel. But still a luxury. Qsuite is every bit as good as advertised. We flew in the central backward facing seats on the way out. Great novelty factor and the flight literally flew by no pun intended. Food and drink are amazing and the flights were simply not long enough to get through it all between London and Adelaide. By the time youve finished playing with the seat had a few drinks eaten watched the movies and slept youve arrivedfeeling raring to go. No jet lag either way and so straight into the holiday. Sat on the window seats on the way home as the one drawback of the centre seats is no individual air vents which meant the cabin got stuffy. In the A350 900 the second smaller cabin is better almost empty very quiet and on the A350 1000 front cabin is better as the rear one is closer to the galley and WC. Lovely crews who all introduce themselves and remember your name.As always positive interaction always repaid in full. Bravo Qatar for a once in a lifetime return trip.
Our flight from Amsterdam 1July was 3 hours delayed due to staff shortages in Amsterdam airport security. Upon arriving in Doha on the 2July we had to quickly transfer to our connecting Perth flight. We were assured that our baggage would make the flight . When we arrived in Perth our baggage was not there. We made a claim with the baggage handling service Menzies. They said they would email us the next day this never happened. We made a similar claim with Qatar but their lack of response with dealing with our missing baggage has been terrible. After 3 days Qatar has not been able to locate our baggage or supply the last known location. The baggage department does not answer the phone their email or their WhatsApp chat function. We have no idea whether well ever see our baggage again.
Delay flight. Reasonable ticket price with luggage fee. Not clear checkin available time. Quite slow process at airport after landing. Quality snack.
London to Amsterdam. A delayed BA flight by 55 mins. Old airplane unhelpful staff. Delays seem so regular that staff have a casual attitude to delays. Another terrible show from British Airways.
Cusco to Lima. Worst airline ever. Before we even arrived in Peru they changed our flights twice as much as a day so our whole tour was effected. Today our flight was cancelled and only option given was later tonight so we missed our connection to Iquitos which affects our Iquitos hotel Booking and Amazon tour. They offered free lunch and hotel. The hotel we couldnt arrange until lining up in Lima airport al over again. Zero information. We have had to book another airline for 6 people so we can make our Amazon tour. Absolutely furious
Chennai to Los Angeles via Singapore. I have been flying this route on Singapore Airlines for about 30 years. Although the overall level of service is good there has been a decline in passenger facilities and comfort. Their Business class lounge in Chennai is a joke with about 20 seats in a small enclosure resembling a neglected warehouse. The seats on the Singapore Los Angeles segment are flat beds but they are difficult to operate. Most people needed assistance from the flight attendants to switch between the flat bed and regular seating positions. Meals are ok but nothing great. The in flight entertainment is below average. There is the annoying halt for just over an hour in Tokyo where all passengers have to disembark and go through security before reboarding the aircraft. Overall Singapore Airlines will no longer be my first choice carrier unless they attend to these issues.
Istanbul to Montreal. Everyone was boarding at the same time No grouping no priority and as the plane was full boarding took quite some time. Plane was new 3 years old and had 242 layout. Seat itself was okay comparable to other longhaul flights Ive taken. Legroom was good Im 6 foot and I had no problems. Food and drink service was amazing we were first handed packs of peanut followed by a drink service then dinner. The food was really good and was filling for one person. Drinks were provided throughout the flight. IFE was good and there were plenty of films and series. One complaint is that there were some random episodes of some TV Series like Season 4 Episode 567 of a series. Crew was helpful and unlike other Turkish Airlines flights Ive taken they were able to have an actual conversation in English. I bought in flight WiFi for 14.99US and it worked well throughout the flight.
Lyon to Oran. Two Airbus A320 are mainly dedicated for operations between Lyon ad Algeria. I would allow that the service tends to decrease. I cant stand how Aigle Azur operates charter planes with high density configuration for regular flights between France and Algeria. It is unbearable to get sat so tight in those seating rows impossible to move or eat correctly.
Very pleasant flight from Kolkata to Paro with Druk Air. Friendly and efficient cabin crew. Nice snack and drinks. Even got boiled sweet for landing. Superb scenery en route especially as we approached Paro of course. Have no idea of cost as was booked as part of package but overall excellent.
London to Brisbane via Dubai. Our flight from London Heathrow was late which resulted in us rushing through the transit to book in for the next connecting flight from Dubai to Brisbane via Singapore. When we arrived at the Dubai check in it was apparent that there was something wrong but the Emirates staff just talked amongst themselves. After some 15 or 20 other passengers checked in after us for the same flight 5 of them Business Class customers the Emirates staff told us that they had changed our seats and we couldnt sit together but they offered no reason for this I told the staff that we had booked these seats and my partner was a nervous flyer so we could not sit in separate locations. They said you have no choice I asked to be upgraded to 1st class they refused I offered to travel on the next flight 02.30hrs some 5 hours later I was abruptly told that our luggage was on the flight that we were originally booked on 21.15hrs and we needed to board that flight as it was departing in a few minutes. Their attitude for Business Class customers or any customer was deplorable. We arrived at Brisbane but our luggage didnt the staff at Brisbane were helpful but couldnt tell us where it was as it hadnt been scanned in at Dubai. I then got access to text messages on my mobile phone which I couldnt obtain whilst on the flights for some reason the text read due to operational reasons we have had to transfer you to the flight that departs from Dubai at 02.30hrs why didnt the staff at Dubai know about this instead of refusing me travel on this service especially when I had offered to do just that. We waited at Brisbane for the next flight to arrive but still no luggage. It took Emirates 3 days to get our luggage to us by this time we had travelled to Cairns as this was how we had booked our holiday and accommodation. On our return flight to London which departed from Melbourne we checked in and the staff said due to the flight being full we have changed your seats from Dubai to London. I couldnt understand why this would be necessary just because the flight was full again I refused this and asked to be upgraded no was the reply. We then had to wait at the customer service desk and they eventually explained that they had e mailed Dubai and we had got our original seats although the staff pointed out to me that the seats were only a request and not guaranteed I showed them an email from Emirates which confirmed the flight and seat details from the outset of the booking. The Emirates customer service desk operative made a point that she had done us a favour in getting our original seats back. When we arrived at Dubai check in again we were faced with we have changed your seats. I couldnt believe this and again had to wait and argue to get our original seats. The staff on the plane were very attentive and polite on all legs but the staff on the ground just dont care rude and not worthy of the Emirates uniform. I asked several times how much do you want me to pay before you start giving us some level of service I have written to Emirates with the complaint and incredibly they have referred it to Qantas because Emirates were only operating the flight on their behalf how that works when it was the Emirates staff who caused the issues I dont know.
Very poor customer service and a disappointing experience. Avoid if you can. This company offers a budget service far worse than other competitors and when flights get cancelled only offers a voucher instead of a refund.
Ponta Delgada to Gran Canaria. Worst airline I have flown so far. Two out of two flights would be allocated a week earlier so I arrived at noon instead of noon. Both flights were delayed. The food on board was lousy and the aircraft old. You really can not recommend this airline.
Subang to Singapore with Firefly. As departure airport is a small airport with little traffic pushback was quick and flight took off on time and landed before time. Light refreshments in the form of a snack and a drink were served. There were only 2 cabin crew on this short flight and small aircraft whom were polite and professional.
Gatwick to Prague. So after few years Ive decided to fly with Travel ServiceSmart Wings again wont do that for some time again. Since prices from Heathrow were too expensive on this date and I didnt want to fly from Stansted and I wanted it to fly in the evening there wasnt that many options to Prague so I chose SmartWings. First plane arrived hour late but with that problems only started. Than boarding started much later for some reason they had boarding in 3 sections for 183 people first people from back of the plane I was in front but when I went to tunnel people were still there because for some reasons they needed to start boarding from front they said because of balance of the aircraft I fly a lot but this is first time Ive heard this on boarding. So another delay than after some time when crew wasnt able to count all the people on board we finally took off and landed hour and 20 minutes after we were scheduled. Than deboarding started and again for the first time in my life Ive heard that we were deboarding from back of the plane so first people from the back but using front sky bridge which took another 20 minutes so overall time was almost 2 hours and 1 hour is on lack of skills of this so call airline. Only positive is that you got check it baggage but thats it they also have wifi and seats were ok but that wont compensate for all the other things. So unless I have too I wont fly with them any time soon. I would say worst or one of the worst airlines in Europe
I had heard lots about this airline. Somehow they were able to justify their services. Sanitation and cleanliness were lacking they need to bring this matter to their attention. Hospitality was great from your staff.
Took a flight with US Airways from JFK to Asheville with a change of plane in Charlotte. Our flight left JFK one hour late the Captain said he was waiting for paper work to be signed. We therefore missed our flight to Asheville the US Airways staff at Charlotte were very rude and could not care less. I had to beg to use a phone to call my cousin who was picking us up in Asheville to let her know what had happened. The agents at Charlotte said there were no seats left on any flights leaving for Asheville that day or the next I asked what should I do they said not our problem and shrugged their shoulders. I went to the desk and asked for a refund for the Charlotte to Asheville part of the trip and they cancelled my return flight as well.
I booked Business Class for my route from Delhi to Chennai for my wife and me 2 tickets. At checkin the ground staff informed me that due to aircraft change there are no Business seats and that we are downgraded to Economy. Until now after numerous contact with Customer Care I did not get any indemnification voucher or other as a compensation. Very disappointing customer management.
Cancelled flight to Cardiff by Qatar was not compensated for and led to an additional 8 hour trip with extra costs. It was a great looking flight initially but the reality is Im flying via Heathrow and will be further out of pocket and face 36 hours of travel. No upgrade offered nothing except Doha accommodation. Last year we had 24 hours in Doha as a result of poor connection time frames and this year we ran to the connecting flight. Qatar Airways let us down with their schedule changes and optimistic connection time allocation. No matter how good the flight customers dont want extra travel time and costs time in Doha or cancelled schedules and if those things do happen it is very much appreciated when airlines understand that.
Truly amazing cabin crew fantastic and couldnt be any more attentive. I have flown with Qatar airways for several years and there is no better airline. I cant express this enough.
Roundtrip with family from JFK to HYD via LHR. Onward flight was delayed at JFK by 2 hrs. Was stressful with 10 month old and a 4 yr old. Inflight service was good. Transit at LHR was a nightmare Mile long walk after alighting to central point in Terminal 5. No gate information anywhere. Had to checkin again they had to scan each and every food item for the baby Though departing flight was from same Terminal 5 had to now walk 3040 yards go down a level walk again to train get off second stop go up escalator again and walk another 50 yards to last gate C63. Now here the gate agent wouldnt let our carry on through. Said it was too big. So had to remove all baby food and items for the kids and carry them in our hands inside the plane and check the carryon. Return flight again was delayed. Had checked in at 3.30am for 6.40am flight but flight took off at 9.15am. Transit at LHR was thankfully better this time. But the aircraft to JFK was an old 747 falling apart. No bulkhead this time as original flight was late and they had to accommodate us on another full flight. Old seats kept reclining on its own. AC was blowing hot and cold until takeoff. Had asked staff to serve meals first to the 4 yr old no luck. Never going to fly British again or pass through LHR again
VIE to KIV. The experience was quite odd like going back into the Soviet days as they were using a Yak40 on the flight. Staff friendly and relatively professional although it felt almost like a charter flight. The meal was quite good and flight was on time. The cabin layout was really bizarre with something looking like a couch near the front of the plane and little leg room in my seat. The fact that they didnt deice the plane it was snowing hard at takeoff freaked me out a bit too. Not sure if theyre still using the Yak40 but if you happen to get on this one its certainly a unique experience if youre up for it.
Chicago to Chennai via London. The pilot and captain were top class the flight was delayed by more than 4 hours but they made it up to 2 hours and was smooth. Chicago check in staff unfriendly it took them 28 minutes to serve 2 of us. The only thing they tried was to upsell me into First Class. Meals excellent choices veg or non veg is all the crew asked business. My co passenger asked for a menu answer you are booked for veg meal so that will be served. He asked for drinks menu answer What do you want The seat was claustrophobic closed and uncomfortable. The crew was unsmiling.
We had a multi city booking through Expedia to travel in Aeromexico. We had to change one of our travellers tickets when we called them they didnt offer a penalty fee didnt say because we booked through Expedia we need to call them they sold us a whole other ticket for 700. Weve now been back and forth with their customer service Expedia and the insurance we purchased and no one can help us Everyone keeps passing the blame around and no accountability. Not to mention their customer service in general on the phone or at the airport is garbage. Not only have they havent given us any type of partial refund but they did sell the seat to someone else which they have denied. Yet the seat was taken on our flight back. So no refund they charged my mother a full ticket and sold her seats.
I flew with a friend on the 3 December in Club Economy from Buenos Aires to Bariloche with a return booking for 9 December. The aircraft was a brand new Boeing 737800 and the 2 by 2 sets in the forward Club Economy very comfortable and done in soft leather. A small snack was served by very friendly cabin staff and all was well until the beverage cart rolled by and we asked for some Malbec wine and were told that Aerolineas do not serve wine on domestic flights One can imagine my surprise that after paying USD 992 per ticket that the flag carrier of Argentina which grows some of the worlds finest wines does not showcase this product onboardthey did not even give us the option to purchase wine on a two hour flight We will be returning to Buenos Aires on LAN.
The staff at Dublin airport are very rude and unprofessional. I was 3 hours early for my flight from Dublin to New York. I needed help at the Dublin airport. I asked 5 different Aer Lingus staff for help and was told 5 different answers. I even spoke to a supervisor who was the worst of all the staff. In the end I missed my flight and had to reschedule. For Dublin to be the home hub for this airline they were the worst people to deal with. The hub in New York at JFK airport was must nicer and professional. The WIFI did not work in the plane and only half of the screens worked. The plane staff even made an announcement about the screens freezing up while watching a movie. The lady in the seat in front of us had a broken seat. It only reclined.
The name Avianca used to be associated with something special. My last flights were a chain of terrible experiences due to the new policies of the airline very randomly implemented by the employees. I brought an overweight suitcase and they made me pay an additional 120 USD. Thats crazy. I also had to pay 80 for two very small boxes that I planned to bring as a personal item. Interestingly people who were traveling with much larger items were allowed to proceed without purchasing additional luggage i.e. guitars. During the ticketing process Avianca employees were forcing passengers with suspected personal items too large to get out of the ticketing line to measure their items in an attempt to extort more money similar to other cheap airlines. Avianca is poorly executing a reset of itself and they are not doing a good job. Avianca is now the worst airline in LATAM not the best. I will only fly with Avianca if there are no other options.
I am writing this with complete dismay disappointment shock helplessness and utter anger. If you know what is good for you avoid this airline at all costs. I have dreamed of a Morocco trip since 2005. This trip is a lifelong dream. Ive booked multiple flights in and around Morocco for October to November. In a span of several weeks almost each single flight has been moved and rescheduled. The last straw was when I received an email today notifying a flight change that will mean losing 2 days in Morocco and completely ruining the entire itinerary and losing some paid transfers and tours in the process. I am in complete disbelief as I have been traveling for 28 years and have never encountered an airline so incompetent. They have removed every single way to reach them. All emails are automated you cannot contact anyone through email and the number they gave to call is also not in service. I feel so helpless and our trip has been singlehandedly ruined by Air Arabia even before it began. I have lost all hope and excitement for this trip and even if I somehow manage to find a way to adjust our itinerary it will still not recover a portion of the trip that has already been paid for. This company should be banned because all reviews here have a horror story of their own.
Coxs Bazar to Dhaka nonstop and one hour flight on a Bombardier Dash8Q300 on June 12. Excellent webpage meant was able to purchase domestic Bangladeshi flights from the UK using a UK debit card. Customer service personnel in Dhaka very helpful over the phone when requested confirmed itinerary resent via email. Checkin a breeze. Nice cabin interior and smartly turned out FAs provided snacks and beverages. Flight left on time and arrived the same.
Flight was 1 hour late leaving gate. Crew were friendly. Seats comfortable. But the complimentary snack provided was a bag of ready salted crisps.
Ankara to Antalya. The plane was relatively new with a nice interior. Coffeetea and a sandwichcake were coplimentary on a 50m domestic flight. I was really impressed. The seat was very comfortable and the cabin crew friendly. All these for less than 20 euros with a 15kg luggage included in the price. Definitely recommended
Beirut to Istanbul. Worst company ever. Flight was delayed 3 hours without prior notice and whenever asked why nobody responded. Some passengers lost their other connection flights because of this delay.
Singapore to Penang. First time on SilkAir so did not know what to expect given the limited reviews. Check in was T2 and used the KrisFlyer lounge in T2 which is nowhere near as good as the lounge in T3. Flight was only about 55 minutes. Cabin crew do not have the same skills or level of service as that of Singapore Airlines. After the crew serve the meal they are more interested in talking to each other than attending to the passengers. Seats comfortable. Nothing special but did the job.
Insel Air from Miami to Aruba on 11212015 was delayed for 6 hours. Scheduled dep time was 1500 actual dep was 2100 reason given was maintenance issues with plane. I had a connecting flight from Aruba to Bonaire flight431 which had left already at the time of arrival in Aruba. We the passengers were told that flight 431 would wait for us in Aruba for the flight to Bonaire which was not the case. We were told that there is another flight at 900 to bring us to Bonaire which was not the case either. We eventually were flown out from Aruba to Bonaire at 430 on 1122 and arrived a whole day late. I booked hotel and scuba diving excursions which were lost to me. The return flight from Bonaire to Curacao flight 302 on 11242015 which was scheduled to depart at 700 actually departed at 0900. The flight from Curacao to Miami on 11242015 was scheduled to depart at 1000 but was delayed again to 2200 which was a 12 hour delay Reason again maintenance issues with the plane. I purchased a ticket on AA from Curacao to Miami which departed on time at 1620. I paid 219 for the AA flight back to Miami. I asked Inselair repeatedly to issue either a partial refund or voucher andor pay for my return ticket form Curacao to Miami on 1124 with AA in the amount of 219. The airline declined to offer any reimbursement for these extensive delays on both outbound and return flights. In my opinion this airline is also extremely unfriendly with customers. The passengers were repeatedly lied to by the ground personnel and station managers in Miami and Curacao. We were repeatedly told that the plane from Aruba to Bonaire flight 431 would wait for us in Aruba which as not the case.
Round Trip. Both flights had good crew though the outbound crew were much more interactive as a daytime flight. Food excellent on outbound and certainly good on the return. Great seat in 121 configuration. Small delays on both legs but arrived within half an hour of scheduled time. In all respects better than the BA option through London which I frequently use.
The flight from Venice to Stuttgart was delayed because of a general italian strike Eurowings postponed the flight for a couple of hours and we missed our connecting flight to Hamburg. We arrived to Stuttgart the ticket booking desk helped us with the rebooking to the flight we wanted to catch the next day and we were told to go to the hotel and then charge back the costs to the airline. Up to here all good. The airline did everything as they should. The problem started in Stuttgart airport at the Eurowings boarding gate for our flight to Hamburg. We booked Basic and payed additionally to drop each our luggage. We only had a small carry on we travelled light and we checked if we can dropped what we payed for at the boarding gate and the answer was yes Especially happy due to the problems that are currently happening with the luggage. We done so in Venice so why wouldnt this be allowed in Stuttgart The lady working at the Eurowings boarding gate in Stuttgart decided differently and charged us each 50 EUR for our small carry ons so we can drop them next to the plane. We thought it was because the plane was busy or full. No the plan was half empty and there was a lot of space for more carryon luggages. I havent experienced a more dishonest and literally dedicated to customer unsatification employees as these lady at these gate for a very long time. I would not recommend to use Eurowings when flying via Stuttgart and if possible to use Dusseldorf as connecting airport.
Got the cheapest tickets with Viva Air. I knew I chose Economy but for all the hassle it wasnt worth it. Very Long Queues very unhelpful staff on the check in area. Had to pay loads of money just to seat near the 3 children travelling with me then an even bigger amount to have the boarding pass reprinted as my copy wasnt from a laser printer. Even though I had downloaded the tickets to my phone as per their website apparently they dont run that service All and all was just as expensive or more than any other bigger airline company.
I cannot believe that British Airways have such a meagre seat pitch on such a great aircraft. I have been on many short haul flights that would have been far more comfortable let alone a 12 hour flight to Seoul. I am not overweight but I am 6ft2ins tall and when the passenger in front of me reclined his seat there was absolutely no space remaining. The total lack of space ruined an otherwise flawless flight and would certainly make me check alternative airlines for long haul comfort in future.
The airplane was almost new and was in good condition. Departed and arrived on time. No problems with the checked bags. The seat back was a bit on the thin side the new slim seat design. Seat back video screen worked fine but the selection of movies TV programs etc. was rather limited but OK for a night flight. Food was good but not outstanding and it was served quickly after departure. Checkin at PPT started only about 3 hr. before departure. Cabin staff did an OK job but were not outstanding. As the plane departed at midnight most people wanted to go to sleep rather than anything else. Overall the flight was as good as or slightly better than flights offered by United Airlines.
Iasi to Paris. Please pay attention when booking online from their website They add 10 euro on average at the price of the ticket that was initially displayed when you first searched for it in case you dont book it right away. This happens even if you search twice for the same flight in the same day. I think it is the 10th time when this happens to me so I am sure there is no accident. I was receiving several errors when trying to make my online pay and after refreshing the page the total amount to pay was 30 euro higher although I havent modified anything I didnt add any extra service etc. I encourage everyone who has experienced this scam to write a negative post and hopefully they will stop. But this kind of practices show me that they are not a respectable company.
We booked a flight Port ElizabethCape Town in January 2014 Unplanned landing in George because of a malfunctioning cabin door no serious help from the cabin crew. In George we were sent to the transit for the next flight from Port ElizabethCape Town departing 2 hours later which was surprisingly almost empty. Because of that we missed the trip that we booked in Cape Town in the afternoon. No desk at Cape Town Airport from South African Express no answer from them after we send our complaint and no sorry from their side. Really disappointing.
Taipei to Seoul. The stewardesses were polite and helpful. I was surprised by the comparative good quality of meals they provided for a less than 3 hour flight from Taipei to Seoul with metal cutlery. The aircraft was new and comfy with many entertainment choices. You dont need to beg for pillows or blankets these were automatically provided to you. Their ground staff in Seoul do need to improve their English skills if they want to attract more international travelers.
I flew Auckland to Sydney with LAN Airlines. It was my first flight on a Boeing 787 and I was impressed by the level of confort. The bigger windows with electronic shadowing is a very good difference. The entertainment is pretty good but they should increase the number of language versions. For example a documentary in the business session was only in Portuguese. The breakfast was not the best but fine. The cabin crew extremely friendly and with a positive mood. I would not mind to fly with them on a longer flight to fully test their product.
I booked some extra baggage for a flight but Jetstar added it to the wrong flight then charged me excess baggage fees then would not fix it. So hard to contact them also. Worst airline Ive ever experienced
JetBlue has to be the worst airline flying out of South Florida right now especially since the fort Lauderdale closure on April 12th JetBlue has canceled the late night fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas flight flight 607 three times. One flight was canceled on a Monday which 3 days after they actually opened up the airport. That also means that the people in Las Vegas waiting for flight 607 cannot get back to fort Lauderdale because the flight never gets to Las Vegas The ripple effects are disastrous JetBlue also has four local flights such as fort Lauderdale to Jacksonville and Jacksonville back to the fort Lauderdale and fort Lauderdale to Cuba and Cuba back to fort Lauderdale flight number 17 18 1499 and 1500 and for the past 4 days each of them have been delayed anywhere from 3 to 6 hours with two of them being canceled all together and weather really has nothing to do with it since April 15th the weather has been fine down here we have had very little rain. But even the four local flights which are only about an hour and 20 minutes apart also been delayed 3 to 6 hours or have been canceled About a year ago Jetblue stated to the public that they will have fewer frequency of flights which will allow them more flexibility when things go wrong but obviously that is not the case.
I had my doubts after seeing bad reviews but both flights were seamless. They left on time and arrived early even though it was spring break. The smaller airport at Wilmington was easier and quicker to navigate.
Dubai to Bangkok The Emirates experience has been degrading for years. Whereas flights of over 7 hours used to have two meals they now have just one. Not even a snack can be spared on those flights even all the European airlines they try to talk down do a sandwich or a snack halfway through the flight. Where the meals themselves would come with a lot of things on the side and used to be of good quality you now get the same halfseasoned and halfbaked meals they even offer on budget airlines. The advertised WiFi is nonexistent on many flights yes the you can connect to OnAir but mostly there is no connection behind it. The quality of their crew has been degrading as well. After years and many flights on Emirates its time for me to move back to European airlines who seem to have stepped up their game under competition and who in general offer much better service and customer protection.
It was my first time flying with Aigle Azur. To be honest I didnt choose it but Hainan Airlines. To start with we took off with more then 2 hours delay without notifications. It wasnt the airport issue but the company problem because we had to wait for the plane to arrived from Sao Polo. I will skip the onboard service. So we arrived with 2 hours delayed and with other customers we have a connection flight to Shanghai. This second flight is Hainan Airlines. Obviously the flight didnt wait for us. No one to received us after landing to give instructions or anything. When we asked to change the connection flight ticket at Hainan counter we are told Aigle Azur didnt confirmed the delay in your flight so we cant change your flight ticket. The company is late and didnt even assume its responsibility. As a result we had to pay for an other flight ticket Aigle Azur customer service doesnt even exist isnt reachable. Worst airline I experienced I should have considered to read the reviews about this airline first.
REX Is now flying to CoomaSnowy Mountains airport as of 10th June starting at AUD129 one way all inclusive I think its on the web. A number of airlines have tried to make it successful but it hasnt worked but with REX already having a good reputation and more financial support I think it might work. My only worry though is that the Airport is at 960m above sea level and is right on the Gt Div Range and its flat and between to other ranges it is a pretty bad wind tunnel and if it snows which is quite often in winter maybe once every 3 weeks will the flights be cancelled
My flight was deliberately overbooked and despite having booked my tickets 10 months prior and arriving at the airport 4 hours early I was turned away despite having a ticket. We were persistently told different things by different members of staff. I rang Air Malta customer service who said they would call me back and then literally hung up on me. The Air Malta representative at the airport then refused to speak to us. When I rang the day before I was guaranteed the flight was not overbooked and there was no problem. I have never been subjected to such dreadfully poor customer service. Offers of remedial compensation will not make up for the inconvenience and distress caused by your airlines shameless overbooking.
Chicago to Frankfurt via Keflavik. We have a big delay from more then 2 hours. I miss my connection flight to Frankfurt. Wow air not give us any food or even a water. The put us in an old hotel. No information and only you can open a claim to us in the service hotline. I spend more the 50 only for phone calls to wow. Dont book this airline. I booked ana xxl seat and get downgrade to row 29 and must now fight with Wow air to get my money back.
Udon Thani to Bangkok. Pleasant uneventful flight friendly crew clean aircraft arrived early quick luggage delivery at Don Mueang airport. Checkin in Udon Male agent could not be bothered opening his mouth to say for instance hello or something as simple as that entire checkin process was done in complete silence at 6.45am maybe he was still tired.
I was very happy with my overall experience. Staff was super helpful at the airport not to mention the friendliness of the crew and captains onboard. On most airlines the crew are either super salty or sickly sweet and I would say this one was friendly and professional with authenticity. Flight was on time arrived at CDG early and all of our baggage made it to our final destination. Ive flown with most airlines at this point as Im American and have to fly back home often to see family. Ive had so many bad experiences with things not working properly rude staff unwillingness to help unexplained cancellations lost baggage etc. This is one of the best flights Ive been on. Spend a little extra to have the AF Delta experience.
Awful. Impossible to check in online after many many attempts. Had a 4 hour layover and didnt end getting a customer service rep to issue our boarding passes until just before the flight nerve wracking as hell. Once on board we were served two horrible disgusting meals. We were told we were going to have premium entertainment only to find out none of the screens wifi or charging outlets for phones were working for a 10 hour flight Seat wouldnt recline and lock so I either sat straight up for 10 hours or rocked back and forth. The only thing good about this flight was we landed safely and our flight was smooth kudos to the pilot
There was overbooking for about 8 passengers on my flight. The next scheduled flight I was offered is after twelve hours at late night. No reaction on my complaint for months since this time.
My parents both 90 years old with a business class reservation were removed from their seats before departure because my mother apparently was not wearing her mask correctly. She was reminded a few times she is hard of hearing at 90 and then they were both removed from the plane. I understand airline policies about mask mandates but minimal understanding and kindness to older people apparently is not part of SwissEdelweiss policy. I myself have had already my share of bad experience with Swiss after a flight was cancelled during covid I have no problem with that but Swiss rebooked me for the day before my scheduled departure and no email nor telephone notification. In addition when I bought a new flight and purchased a seat with printed confirmation from Swiss at checkin they announced I was not on the flight list and they argued with me for 2 hours at checkin before they finally let me run to the gate. Oh yes they did acknowledge that they see my seat reservation but I was not listed as a passenger. I personally will never book with Swiss again.
This was my first time flying with Vistara. I travelled in business class and I was the only one there. I had two check in suitcases under 25 kgs 1 small bagpack and 1 cabin bag. I had one extra cabin bag which weighed 8 kgs. They did not allow me to take it on board and insisted me to pay 160 to check it in. I asked the agent if she can reduce the price a little if I have to check the bag in and she refused. Never am I ever going to do the mistake of travelling with this airline.
I flew with Air Dolomiti twice in May even though I was initially supposed to fly with Lufthansa but they changed us to Air Dolomiti. Both flights were late the first one was 3 hours late and made us miss our connecting flight to the USA. The second flight from Frankfurt to Trieste was one hour late. On the second flight they made my mother have her case under her feet because there was no space in the overhead cabins while they let people keep their backpacks and jackets there.
Business class booking my seat was covered in hairs pillows and blankets too food was disgusting champagne low quality. Cabin crew couldnt care less about customers experience. Arrived at Melbourne Airport my Rimowa bag was totally smashed unable to use the wheels couldnt take public transport to my families home 150km from the airport due to luggage damage. I was stuck abandomed at the airport alone a single female traveller No choice but to rent a car at the airport which put me out of pocket 500. Customer responsibility is below 0. Compensation offered 5000 Qantas frequent flyer points to the equivalent of AUD45.00. This airline needs to take accountability for high paying flyers I will never fly Qantas again as a tourist visiting Australia.
Kiev to Doha. Plane took off on time and landed 20 minutes prior schedule. Great service in the cabin and on the ground. Had 3 available food options. Comfortable seats. Best choice for me out of many airlines. I like their will to help passengers to personalize customer service.
Flew Qatar Airways from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow via Doha. Usual high quality product but far from 1010 perfection notably departure and arrival into Abu Dhabi. Good points pristine aircraft and crew inflight entertainment excellent timekeeping. As a Silver Privilege card holder I benefit from accessing the upperdeck snug on the A380 at no extra cost. This is at least equivalent to the inflatedprice Premium Economy provided by European airlines excellent. Particularly impressed with Heathrow. On arrival immigration cleared and bags collected in less than 15 minutes even for a Chinese passport holder. On departure from T4 no queue at checkin although other airlines appeared to have issues with ample seating excellent wifi and refreshment options at High Street prices in the departure lounge 1 for a Boots sandwich a steal. Gripes in common with other middle east airlines the continued use of buses at Doha that dump connecting passengers at furthest distance from the departure terminal minimum 20 minute walk albeit for both legs without a requirement to pass through further security checks continual promotion of complimentary wifi on the aircraft that seldom actually worked and in any event is only complimentary for a maximum of 10 minutes during the flight. The inadequacies of AUH are well documented elsewhere. Suffice with Qatar departures at 0555 and 0645 the former a B777A332 checkin was chaotic with woefully inadequate provision of desks and organization of queues which fortunately on this occasion did not delay departure. This is a daily event so no excuses. On return to AUH after the interminable taxi to the far end of the airport thereafter a 30 minute wait for ground services to provide stairs to the obligatory bus and an hour to clear immigration Accepted airport travails are largely outside the control of the airline. Nonetheless Qatar surely has the wasta to secure improvement especially at Doha AUH may be a lost cause however. I would lose no sleep were Qatar to switch additional resources to DWC and offer an express coach from Abu Dhabi centres in lieu of serving AUH. Indeed were the policy pursued I would likely benefit from additional sleep.
Kuala Lumpur to Vancouver via Shanghai. Ever get that feeling when you realize that you are a fool for making a certain purchase Thats China Eastern Airlines. Horrible food. Rude staff. Poor service. Uncomfortable Seats. Its like they take pride in giving awful service. The only good thing I can say is the seats were cheap but having said that you will get much better value paying more for any other airline.
Johannesburg to London via Dubai. Very good flights overall my only gripe is the comfort of the seat but in economy class that is to be expected. Meals were very tasty and the IFE lives up to the hype. Kudos Emirates
Medellin to Bogota. VivaColombia is the worst airline I have flown and that is a reflection of their customer service rules and the overall experience. The people that represent this company are very rude and routinely say things like you can visit our website if you have questions about our policies instead of explaining it to you. They are a budget airline however in the end you pay more for an experience so bad its actually difficult to put into words. Imagine paying for a boarding my pass unless you have a physical printout of it They have changed the specifications of the size of luggage you are allowed to bring for carry on just so they can force you to pay for it. I have flown this airline three times and I will never fly them again.
Istanbul to Berlin. Onur Air is the worst airline Ive travelled. While youre standing in the line for checkin in the Ataturk airport there are security guys of this airline who check passports of random people they asked me about what I was doing in Turkey what do I do in Germany what is my profession how long did I stay etc. After that they took a picture of my passport and my residence permit on their camera without any explanations this is violation of data privacy. Regarding planes they are old and look very cheap inside legroom is so small you can barely fit your kneesand I am only 177cm high. Crews English is so bad I didnt get anything they said during the flight. Summary never again for any price Id better pay 50 eur more for Turkish Airlines or any other alternative but wont go through this humiliation again.
My experience was less convincing. The reservation line was always busy and it takes ages to get through. The seat is large and comfortable to sit but to sleep it is not comfortable at all too hard too narrow footrest and you sleep in a diagonal position which is awkward. I could not sleep at all during the whole flight. And the food was really bad very tough meat overcooked and bad taste. Worst food I had in a long time. Staff is friendly but not efficient sometimes it takes ages to get some water or bread etc. Overall really disappointing experience. A pity as they used to be good some years ago. In any case I will not chose them again.
Zagreb to Singapore via Istanbul. All it takes is just one confident ground crew staff member who empathizes with the emotions of a passenger in distress over mistaking the flighttime 2005 as the checkin time for 2205. After a twoweek holiday my husband and I arrived at the airport to check into Flight TK1056. To my horror I discovered that the gate was closed And the flight was schedule to take off in 15 minutes However we were blessed by the presence of a groundstaff member. I regret not having asked for her name but thankfully I had taken a snapshot of her while waiting to board the plane and I have attached her picture to this note of thanks. I only realised my mistake when I wanted to check in my luggage at 2000. I asked the Zagreb airport information staff for help. She calmly and gently directed me to Turkish Airline staff who made a few calls for quick checks and sprung into action. She got a groundstaff to reopen a counter and made a very quick checkin. She then opened up a channel all through the security checks immigration process and all the way up to the boarding gate. In ten minutes or less we were at the boarding gates. What I really appreciate most about her was her knowledge and understanding of the processes involved. She explained to us along the way that flights from Istanbul to Zagreb had been delayed because Istanbul had experienced very bad weather that afternoon and almost all flights from Istanbul were delayed. So even though I had divine help in that my flight was delayed I may not have been able to get on board the flight if not for this particular lady who went out on a limb and call in favours through all the channels of security and luggage processing to get our luggage into the cargobelly of the plane and to rush us to the gate in time for our flight. Thank you Turkish Airline and Zagreb Airport. On a separate issue I also would like to add that Turkish airline is also very mindful of the needs of its passengers. I appreciate the night pack that was given during my red eye flight from Singapore to Istanbul and from Istanbul to Singapore. The night pack contains the most useful things for a more comfortable flight.
Terrible. My family and I were forced to check our bags even though there was plenty of room in the overhead compartments for our carry ons and our carry ons were within the size limit for the compartments. Once at the baggage claim all of our bags eventually came out except for mine. We headed into the customer relations office to ask if they knew where my bag was and the womans response was Weve been waiting for you to come in here. They then proceeded to show me that my bag had been completely shredded and several items inside had been shredded as well. It was very obvious that they were not planning on going out of their way to show me my damaged bag or make up for the damages. Im very disappointed with the customer service and the lack of awareness in todays world. I will not be flying with American again.
Boston to Munich via Dusseldorf. This trip was the worst out of all and I was very disappointed with Air Berlin. I was traveling with one other person and her bag was lost and not returned for another week after it was found. She tried to call the company multiple times and it was nearly impossible to get a hold of someone to talk to. The flight attendants on our flight were also downright rude. I am a very easy going person and not much bothers me but they way they spoke to us and handled any problems was highly unprofessional. Trying to board the plane alone was an absolute mess. I would not recommend this airline to anyone looking to fly to Europe.
I was supposed to travel Business Class with Iberia from Madrid to Guatemala. To my horror and surpris I found out in the VIP lounge that I was denied access because I was no longer flying Business class with Iberia. This airline decided to switch planes moving me to a so called Premium Economy in a plane from Level. I was not able to do anything about this change so I was forced to travel with this awful low cost company with uncomfortable seats terrible service unprofessional and very rude crew. 11 hours of torture. Never ever again
I flew from Olbia to Paris CDG. Overall positive feedback service on board was good and flight attendants proved to be really helpful. Only negative part is arriving at CDG terminal 3 a very poor infrastructure.
Boarding at JFKs Terminal 4 orderly and efficient. Seats comfortable for the nine hour flight back to Honolulu. The cabin crew was awesome with their food and snack service. The complimentary wine with the meals is a nice touch albeit the only course was a vegetarian pasta dish with salad and cookie. The snack prior to landing was good as well especially with the macnut chocolate included. The flight itself was extremely smooth with very little turbulence along the way. Of the various airline pilots from different companies which I have flown HA pilots make the smoothest landings well appreciated. HAs entertainment could use more varieties of movies and definitely a wifi system on board which HA has none. All in all thank you Hawaiian for a job well done. Hawaii truly does fly with Hawaiian.
Worst experience every time. No time sense. Keeps getting delayed or cancelled. Not recommended. Staff very rude and irresponsible. Do not help you out when the mistake is on their side.
Madrid to Porto. A relatively modern CRJ1000 22 seating offered more legroom than Iberia A320. Flight almost an hour late but this is becoming the norm at MadridBarajas so its not a big deal. Crew pleasant and served drinks and a small packet of nuts on 1 hour flight.
Air Malta flight from Malta to Gatwick. The aircraft was showing its age Tight leg room. Unfriendly and disinterested staff on early flight.
Excellent flight good service with hearty meal starter main course dessert tea and coffee Duty service on board. A generous pitch for economy class seats. Note the delay at departure due to the closure of Orly airport and the flights diverted to Paris CDG.
Flew on GA88 JakartaAmsterdam. I was picked up from my home and the Garuda team were waiting for me at the entrance to the airport and helped check in me in and escorted me through security and immigration. I was then taken to the lounge where I met with Garuda Senior management Pak Irfan Pak Ade Ibu Yanti and Pak Akbar. It was good to see the Garuda senior management greeting the passengers and having open discussions you dont see this with other major airlines. When it came time for boarding I was escorted to the plane by Eca and I would like to thank Eca for her help and assistance . The boarding process was well organized. The cabin crew which was made up of Anna Wanda Puji and the Chef ILyasa provided excellent service throughout the flight. Additionally there was a very good selection of food and snacks available throughout the flight I opted for breakfast only with some minor snacks in between. Free wifi was also provided and teh connection was quite good. Overall another great flight onboard Garuda Indonesia.
Singapore to Reunion via Mauritius. Ive flown with Air Mauritius for more then 30 times but this was the worst experience. First there was no connecting flight from Singapore to Reunion I was told to book a hotel in Mauritius and stay over night. Bad experience the flight was delayed for 30mins then an announcement was made that more information will be announced at 11am. My flight scheduled for 10am was cancelled but only at 1pm the announcement was made. How can one spend so much more money in Mauritius than the flight ticket itself.
Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City with Tigerair. Flight experience was as expected for a low cost carriers I chose it as the schedule was more convenient than other options on this route. Have taken Tigerair many times however this was the first time that after checking in and in the queue for passport control I was pulled out if the line by 2 security people had my carry on bag and back pack weighed and learned that you are only allowed to take 10 kg combined weight. I had exactly the same luggage as my inbound leg and had no issue at all but here I was forced to pay 50 to have my bag checked in. Poor experience and lack of transparency by the airline. Why was this not done at the checkin counter I learned my lessson never again will use this airline as Im not willing to put up with these kind of schemes and ripoffs.
Finnair Customer Support is nonexistent. Tried to book an additional piece of luggage way before the flight. The website said my booking could not be found while still being able to check in much later the chat was constantly congested and after being on the phone for two full hours I did not feel like waiting any longer. I will not fly with this piece of whatgoesinthebin airline ever again.
Customer service is rude because they know they dont need to be otherwise. I asked in Budapest for information on how to leave a comment and they said that there is no way to do so. They said they are not Lufthansa they are just the contracted agency. Therefore they said they do not need to follow Lufthansa rules. So even though I checked with a Lufthansa representative they said it is my responsibility to check with them. I was only able to bring my purse so I am now going to have to hand carry all of my laptops iPad cords. I have no bag for them because they dont fit in my purse. This is the most illogical thing I have ever encountered. I will do every thing I can to not take Lufthansa. They are a really bad airline
Gatwick to Paphos. Chaos at check in as another system failure. Leg room was shocking for a 4 hour flight. Definately a low cost airline now. No food drink IFE and paying for luggage. Long haul BA has barely maintained its standards but short haul British Airways has become a disgrace.
Manila to Tokyo. Of all the 5 star airlines I have been on ANA is the best of the best. Cabin crew were so so friendly cheerful attentive They were really amazing. Food was fantastic seats were comfortable and nice legroom. ANA will be my first choice from now on
I had to book my flight at a short notice and CX was the only airline which was available to fly at under A 1500 return ticket. Their inflight was excellent staff were prompt aircraft was clean food was excellent with ice cream and good quality liquor serve generously. Every seat has their own water bottle and bathroom was kept clean as much as possible. The only issue i found that their online check in is really bad as they want all sectors including in transit. I will certainly travel again with this airline and they were consistent in service.
TAP airlines cancelled my flight from Lisbon to San Francisco for Feb 6th 2023. We were rebooked by TAP on the flight leaving Lisbon on Feb 4th. We couldnt even be in Lisbon on Feb 4th. On the TAP website there is info If your flight has been canceled by TAP you may request full refund of the amount you have paid I requested a full refund for the cancelled flight. Out of 300 I paid for the ticket I received a refund of 47.73. I filed a complaint with TAP and TAP refused to pay the full refund.
Zvartnots to Los Angeles via Doha. Comfortable seat in the flight friendly service ease of moving in the airport great ticket price compliant with COVID 19 very helpful customer service.
When I Originally booked my flight I paid all the extra fees to ensure that I could make a change or even cancel and receive a full refund. Literally less than 12 hours before my flight was set to depart They did a full cancelation of the flight and expected to rebook me days later to arrive at my destination. So I chose the option to cancel my flight and rebook with a different airline. Fast forward to 2 weeks later I still have not received the payment on my credit card. So I phoned customer service tonight to inquire.... And the man I spoke with was the most condescending person I have interacted with in a very long time. period. He was unbelievably rude cut me off repeatedly and was very sarcastic in his answers when I genuinely asked questions about the airline and their performance. Then i find iut this whole time itd because they chose to just credit my account rather than my card Which was not agreed upon when I first booked the flight. Thankfully they refunded me fully in the end but the phone call still somehow ended with this man being terribly rude with me for no reason whatsoever. I was calm polite and friendly through the whole conversation.Im not sure what I did so wrong but I certainly will never make the mistake of booking with Porter again.
Turkish Airlines has changed since the first time I flew them in 2013. The legroom on both flights were not good enough for such a long haul flight. The first leg was a Boeing 777300ER from Miami to Istanbul where the aircraft was quite dated and needed repairs the tray table was dirty TV screen was sticky. The transit time at Istanbul Airport was quite rushed as we landed late at Istanbul and was in a hurry to catch the connecting flight to Bangkok which was supposed to depart 1 hour after my flight from Miami landed. Then when I boarded the 2nd flight to Bangkok which was an Airbus A330300 the legroom was unacceptable for a 10 hour flight the USB was not working on the flight we ended up having technical issues as the TV screens were quite broken with slow quality. The real positive of this experience was the food and beverages which were alright. I think in the future I would be better off to fly with a 5 star airline for future travels. All in all this was quite a disappointing experience and seeing how Turkish Airlines needs to update their planes in order to compete with other airlines and should definitely improve cleanliness skills.
MXPIKA flight IR750 August 8 Airbus 600300 return. Airbus 321300 Flight IR739 August 20 Tehran Rome. Both flights on time. Aircraft dated but well maintained and clean perhaps toilets should have received more attention during the flight. Seating good leg space comfortable seats.
I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed this airline experience. From the check in counter to the TSA at the local tiny airport to the pilots. It is totally a different way of flying commercial and just so much more personal. I wish more routes were like this because its such a nice experience. My flight was also 10 minutes early on arrival which allowed me to get to my next gate with ease. Thank you Boutique Air and hope to fly you again some day Maybe there will be wifi next time
The flight was about one hour and yet the flight attendants managed to hand out refresher towels then they gave each passenger a snack box and on the the third service round each passenger was given a drink. All this was done unhurried with poise and a smile. Such an unexpected level of 5star service. In addition boarding was ontime flight departed and arrived on time. What a great airline.
Dalian to Hong Kong via Fuzhou. The flights were both short normal food everything are normal and fine. The things I really appreciately are the transit service and cabin service for Skyteam ElitePlus members. From Dalian to Hong Kong there is no directly flight but connecting with Xiamen airline with international flight they offer free transit hotel if the flights are on a different day with 24 hours gap. The flight attendants come to say greetings to me with a small water and newspaper.
Doha to London Heathrow in December 2016. Best Economy class ever flown. Seats were comfortable and in flight entertainment was great. We were on row 50 as we had an infant with us the leg room was good for economy and near to the rest rooms. Service and staff attitude was excellent. Breakfast was okay and probably on par with Emirates.
Do yourself a favor when they ask you to line up to check bags before boarding just skip it. Its only an attempt to charge you extra. I had a backpack and a ukulele with me. I was told at the check in counter that the ukulele was fine. Then in this second bag check line the guy said I had to pay a 599 peso fee 30 USD for special handling of the instrument. I was not happy about this as the instrument is much smaller than the majority of the carry ons that people had. I didnt have a choice the instrument wasnt even mine I was bringing it for a friend. I paid the fee thinking they were going to put it somewhere secure for me. No I showed the stewardess my receipt and she said just put it in the overhead. Seriously Then what was the fee for I put it in the overhead and it fit perfectly front to back. They were just making a grab for extra fees. I was angry I should have never gotten in that line. I have messaged Viva Aerobus asking for a refund. I doubt I get it. I will try to dispute the charge with my card because you cant charge a special handling fee and do nothing for it.
Yangon to Singapore. Totally disappointed with Jetstar. Feedback to Jtstar online about their poor management in checking in group check in. On 22 Feb there is a big group checking in group calling out to their members to filled up their luggage weight to maximize and not pay extra . The queue is super long and the staff did nothing. I went to online jetstar feedback and told them about having a group check in and not to delay other passengers. The only reply I get from Jetstar is they will feedback to their team leaders. And they shut off my online chat without letting me reply.
After looking at the reviews from viva me and my friends were a little skeptical to ride on Vivaaerobus. However it was the best experience given our situation. Our frontier flight was cancelled so we booked on VivaAerobus very last minute with a layover in Guadalajara. The workers that checked us in the flight attendants and everyone else were so kind and helpful. They lost a bag but contacted the main person in our group to tell us what was going on then did everything in their power to find the bag. Once the bag was located we were notified and the workers were so apologetic. With everything that had gone wrong with our trip VivaAerobus was the only thing that went perfectly smooth.
Copenhagen to Mexico City via London Heathrow. Upper deck window seat. British Airways uses a 242 configuration with every second seat backwards. To serve window and center seats the crew open a blind between the seats and pass food and drinks over the aisle seat. It also means you will be face to face with the passenger besides you. This could be great or horrible. Food is nothing special but service is polite. Bags did not make the flight but their representative on ground was very helpful and bags arrived next day. I had to pick them up myself. Would fly again as usually have good fares to Mexico.
LHRHKG on the new A380 in premium economy and it was a great trip staff were friendly and the food was very good for a gluten free meal. The only thing that I think they could improve on which Cathay has is the dedicated check in and boarding for there flights other than that it was an enjoyable trip.
Singapore to Luang Prabang via Vientiane. Nice aircraft and nice meal. However during my holidays I received a message that my return flight was cancelled due to no shown which was totally wrong. I had to call my travel agent to understand that the issue was from Lao Airlines. Customer service from Lao Airlines didnt help me at all. Moreover during the way back a technical issue happened on the aircraft during the flight so we had to come back to the airport. Huge delay and not much apologies or explanation. Then I contacted Lao Airline customer service to share my feedback I couldnt get any reply and after investigation and 5 mails they confirmed that the issue was from the airline end due to technical glitch. If you want to travel without any worry I wont recommend at all this company.
Worst experience ever At the time of checkin they have charged me QAR 200 for extra 3kg of luggage and confirmed my seat number which I reserved online prior 48hrs. I brought some goods from Qatar Duty free but they informed that they allowed only 3kg and informed to return to duty free or throw it. Again at the boarding gate without my approval they have changed my seat and the person informed that they have given the seat to someone else and issued a new boarding pass with a different seat. The way they communicate this was not hospitality way. I thing they need more training regarding customer service. This is my last trip with Sri Lankan airlines and never travel again with this and I will not recommend this to anyone.
Our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland barely edible and by far the worst weve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past. The staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals. No snacks were offered during the flight. This is so different to every other airline we have used in the past. After 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny cold stale Ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of Oreos. If ever you decide to fly with them I suggest that you bring your own food. We certainly will on our return flight but will never use British Airways again.
I had quite low expectations for my first trip with Air France and wasnt really looking forward to the experience especially for such a long trip. However I was pleasantly surprised. Ground service in Tokyo was great with delightful ground staff. The overnight flight from Tokyo to Paris was great the crew were all very cheerful polite and friendly and the service was good. The food was enjoyable and I loved the fact that they serve a glass of Champagne as an aperitif in Economy Class. The IFE was excellent a huge selection of arthouse and independent films. Seat configuration a bit cramped with a 343 layout but it was bearable. For my next leg from Paris to Freetown I got upgraded to Premium Economy and was thankful for this the economy class on the dated A340 looked very cramped and was filthy by the end of the 6 hour flight. The plane was 1.5 hours late departing CDG. There was dinner after takeoff and icecream before landing and the food was good. The IFE was limited and the picture quality was poor in economy class the screens were tiny. Staff were more perfunctory than the pervious flight but pleasant enough. I think the main thing to improve on both flights would be the service of drinks having predinner drinks would be nice or just providing more regular drinks services throughout the flight the drinks trolley only came through with the meals and I was not aware of any other drink services. Overall two good flights.
Lyon to Annaba on Air Algerie yesterday. My father who lives in Annaba flies Air Algerie regularly on work and is absolutely fed up with the airline. At Lyon one corner had been allocated for Air Algerie checkin. It seems even the airport authorities have given up on that corner. A good amount of chaos. In the line before the immigration gate few Algerians broke the wire cordon jumped in and broke the queue in spite of being reprimanded by airport officials. Boarding was disorganized with no priority boarding for business class or for the elderly. Upon entering the plane I discovered that seat numbers meant nothing. My seat was occupied and the FA politely told me I could sit anywhere Food was horrible. They ran out of water bottles and started serving water in glasses poured out at the back of the aircraft. The water had a fair amount of salt in it. Upon landing at Annaba it took us over an hour to get out of the chaotic airport despite having cleared immigration in 10 minutes. Basically the bags took that long to come out and this when the Lyon flight was the only flight that arrived at the airport that time...when we landed there was not a single aircraft other than ours domestic or international
Although we knew it was a low cost airline we didnt know SmartWings would be that low in terms of its standards. Lack of possibility to check in online in advance huge lines to just three counters in Prague airport to check in landing in some backyard of the Tel Aviv airport and having to ride to the terminal onboard the airport bus for 2025 minutes and to top it off waiting for the luggage for an hour. I understand that 330 Euro for Tel Aviv to Prague return is not very expensive but Ive used lowcosters before and it was never that horrible
This is my usual route. Very short flight within 30 minutes. The flight was delayed for 50 minutes. Everything seems normal but the aircraft needs serious upgrades. The seat is not comfortable at all. Luckily the flight is short. Again the aircraft needs a serious upgrade. Other than that the crew was super friendly they assist other passengers well. I also notice in this flight the crew explains very details to the passenger who seat at the emergency exit with proper explanations clarify I am not seating at the emergency exit seat but in a row behind it.
A320 from Cork to Izmir on 14th July 2013 and returned on 28th. Aircraft was shockingly cramped. I regularly fly with Ryanair and have never experienced such restricted legroom as on this aircraft. Similarly the ability of the cabin crew to communicate with the passengers was limited by the indecipherable announcements over the PA in Turkish and heavily accented English. Flight itself was incident free and punctual and they used the airbridge in Cork airport which was a pleasant change from Ryanair. I would be very reluctant to book a package holiday with any company that uses this airline.
I usually enjoy to fly with Kuwait airways. However in this occasion the cabin crew left me with tray of food for over an hour. I used the call bell but no one coming and all I can see them at the back chatting. I have rung the bell for the second time and yet no one came. Accidentally one of the crew pass by my seat and ask him if he can remove the empty tray. I also told them i have been calling them for sometime but no one respond.
London Heathrow to Miami with British Airways. Awful experience. Changed our flight from a morning flight to an evening flight on the way out and refused to refund the difference as we were put on a cheaper flight. Then cancelled our return flight without informing us so had to spend an hour of our final evening on holiday speaking to an advisor. The plane on the way out was very old many TVs broken and very uncomfortable. Staff are extremely unhelpful and will never use BA ever again.
I took 4 flights with Emirates and it was an absolutely miserable experience. You get more leg room on an AirAsia flight the food tastes like garbage. And the rudest possible employees you can imagine. I have absolutely nothing positive to say about this airline. Avoid at all cost. Just pay a bit more for a better airline.
Every airline which offers Business Class Travel will assign seats when booking the flight. The exception is British Airways. In January 2016 I booked a flight for two passengers on BA in Business Class from San Francisco to London and back for travel in MayJune. Seats in Business Class are not assigned until 48 hours before flight time. However and here comes another BA first If you want to choose your seats before that time you can do so by paying an extra fee. I ended up shelling out 484 for the privilege of selecting two seats for the return flight. This on top of the steep fare charged for travel in Business Class. I dont begrudge the airlines for their extra profits when the price of fuel takes a massive drop but when an airline then also engages in tactics as described in order to further maximize profitability I rebel.
London to Sydney via Singapore. I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff at the bag drop centre at Heathrow when I lost my passport on Thursday evening 21st November. They spent nearly 2 hours trying to locate it and it was eventually found 30 mins before my flight was due to leave. A big thank you to you all. I would also like to thank the cabin crew on flight BA0015Singapore to Sydney 22 November who were so kind after I was taken ill during the flight I was looked after so well.
Worst flight company ever. Flight was delayed. Small carry on bags with the exact size they mention when buying the ticket is not respected as they oblige you to try to fit your bag in a much smaller box and even if it misses by 0.5 cm they tax you 28 per bag twice on both your roundtrip flight
I am writing about a forthcoming trip and the impossibility to contact Air Transat. Trip MontrealNantesBordeauxMontreal France. Reservation made August 2021 departure 5 June 2022. Recently I received an itinerary change datetime change notification from Air Transat. Now when I check My Booking I get the message Booking cannot be found. The only way AT offers contact service is by telephone but the wait is 3 hours and when choosing the callback option noone calls back. They have removed their email contact service from the website. This is a prepaid trip and I am worried that this is a prebankruptcy ploy by the company to steal our money and avoid all obligations to their customers.
We have previously flown Singapore Airlines in economy and have always been impressed with the service. This trip was our first experience of Singapore Airlines premium economy. Priority checkin and boarding was quick and easy with a friendly welcome and offer of assistance from the crew. The premium economy cabin is just three rows in a 242 configuration and there is plenty of locker space. The seats are comfortable with a good level of recline and good leg room. There is a calf support but this serves little purpose plus a leg rest from the seat in front. Their is a 13inch HD entertainment screen with excellent sound reducing earphones. Having experienced Singapore Airlines excellent economy class service levels expectations of an even better premium experience are unfortunately not met. Service is economy level. There are no pre take off drinks and although champagne is offered when drinks are served after take off it is in a tiny plastic faux wine glass. Wine is of mediocre quality served in a plastic tumbler. Top ups are a long time in coming as there are no dedicated premium economy crew and the same staff serve the economy cabin. Meals were the same as economy with extras such as tablecloths absent. The main reason for traveling premium economy is space and comfort and we had a very comfortable flight and slept well. However we were left with the feeling that Singapore Airlines somewhat belatedly introduced premium economy to keep up with their competitors but have not totally embraced the concept.
TN 102 PPTLAX 3162013 Economy Seat 27B. Departed PPT 15 minutes late for no apparent reason. Told we could not check luggage through to DFW. Entertainment screen control did not work properly also controls overhead reading light. We were skipped for our dinner initially. Attendant seemed bothered that we asked for dinner. Dinner was inedible. Cold slices of meat hard as shoe soles bread that could not be cut. Asked for Diet Coke was told only water was available. Arrived in LAX 15 minutes late. Still had 3 hours to make our connection to DFW. Over an hour before our luggage was available to go through customs. Because we could not check the luggage in PPT had to carry our luggage from the International terminal to AA. Only in LAX does a 3 and 14 hour connection become a nail biter we have always had problems at LAX making connections.
Starting at the checkin desk they asked me for a VISA for a flight between EU member states and not required for my type of passport. Then they told me to go to ticket desk due to an unknown issue. Ticket desk told me everything was okay and go back to checkin desk. There they told me I had not done my online checkin and had to pay 15 euros for each passenger. I showed them the digital boarding pass proof of online checkin. They said that it had been undone and that therefore I had to check in with them and pay the 15 euros per passenger. I had to do it otherwise I would loose my flight. They were doing this to each and everyone trying to drop their luggage with them. Never flying with them again.
San Diego to San Francisco. Virgin America was nicer than Southwest. Entertainment was fantastic seat room wasnt that great but the view of the pacific was beautiful. I would definitely fly them again. It was very easy to get tot the gate because it was so close to security. I got priority security boarding for 15 extra. The flight was much cheaper nonstop than Southwest so I only spent like 75. Alaska Air Virgin America have merged so only have to useearn mileage points on Mileage Plan Alaska.
Flew to Mexico for a 2 week holidaywedding. I was in seat 34B and after about 30mins into the flight the headrest fell off. Stewards were unable to fix it so for 9hrs my head was resting on a metal plate. No alternative seat or gesture of good will was offered. Return flight and again in seat 34B the headrest fell off. So after 14 days no repair had been carried out Again no headrest this is a night flight with no headrest. Complained to Thomsons on my return and they refused any form of compensation for my uncomfortable 9hr flights. This this is the modern and comfortable Boeing 787. For other customers who encounter this Thomsons say just accept it as the seats are not part of the safety of the aircraft.
LondonTripoliJohannesburg. Tripoli airport toilets are so bad you really have to be desperate to use them. Airline good value for money. Cabin crew not very cheerful looked tired all times. The only reason I would fly with them again is value for money but more friendly and cheerful cabin crew needed. A330 plane has good leg room and clean but the A320 plane not much leg room and needs cleaning up.
Tokyo to Amsterdam via London. On the evening before departure I received an email from BA the flight would be delayed for one hour but we were urged to get to the airport on the original time in case there wouldnt be a delay. In the end the aircraft left Tokyo Haneda with a 90 minutes delay. Baggage drop off was smooth and was handled with Japanese politeness. If you have the choice to fly from NRT or HND I would definitely choose HND because its much more conveniently located to downtown Tokyo. The aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were bussed to the aircraft adding more time to the delay we already had. I didnt like the seats on the 777. I found them quite uncomfortable and the legroom was insufficient especially when you have an instant recline type passenger in front of you. On the window and aisle seats theres also the IFE box so theres no place for both feet. The meal was a joke and there was no choise. Inflight entertainment is not up to date small screens with low brightness. The crew was not very friendly. When I went to the galley for a drink I was was urged to return to my seat instead of drinking in the galley and stretching my legs. The second meal service was rushed. Weve got our meals and after 5 minutes the crew returned to pick up the trays because we were already descending to LHR. Luckily Ive made it to my connecting flight to Amsterdam because I had a short connection. The A320 flight to Amsterdam departed ahead of schedule. Theres nothing special to write about this short flight although one round of drinks would have been nice. Unfortunately BA decided to cut the the service on European flights in the race to the bottom.
Singapore to Houston via Manchester. Flight left Singapore on time and cabin crew provided hot towel followed by drink and light supper after take off. FAs patrol the cabin with water juice and snack runs every 1530 minutes and very helpful when I requested additional drinks. They turned the lights back on and started the hot towel drinks and Breakfast service before we arrived in Manchester. Flight deck communication was adequate we know we were ahead of schedule and can expect that Manchester is foggy and cold when we arrived. Entertainment system was a slightly older one without touch screen but still contains more than enough movies TV series and games to keep passengers entertained. The flight left Manchester behind schedule but arrived on time in Houston. Fresh set of crew got on board from Manchester going to Houston. There is one FA that we knew from our previous flight 2 weeks back between SINCGK back then she mentioned shell be in this flight and she was She was one of the better crew members in our past flight and her bright and cheerful personality shines through in this flight as well. Even though other FAs in this flight to Houston were also polite courteous and helpful as expected but most of them were not as personable and does not exude a warm personality in giving their service. Most of the FA on this flight tends to give mechanical service and you can feel that they are here to perform as expected but missing the part where they should be able to engage their customers in a more personal way. However they did a great job in providing their services throughout the flight keeping us full with three meal services and drinksnacks in between also keeping the restrooms clean and wellstocked. Flight deck communications are adequate we were informed about possible turbulences along the way so we can prepare the time we will be arriving in Houston and also the local weather informations.
Doha to Amsterdam on March 20th. In our cabin the attandent was Mrs Gisella. We want to compliment her. A very pleasant friendly lady. The level of service was very high. She worked very hard and constantly. This review is one of appreciation He
Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh City. Extremely disapointed with the airline. After some early months with advertising and claim to be a good and honest airline but finally they are very bad with services and attitude. Flight attendant can only communicate badly in English not native speaker aircraft are old. The ticket is not cheap as they claim themselves as not being a low cost airline but fastly turn out operating the same way with all low cost airlines the ticket does not include check in baggage I felt like I am being cheated force to buy a stupid pack for check in baggage even mine is just a little heavier than 7kg. The services is totally not deserved any like their slogan states bad attitude from the staff Im sure that this is my last time flying with Bamboo.
Seattle to Edmonton 121413 returning 121813. Bombardier Q 400 plane small but with comfortable seating even for a sixfooter as I am. Great cabin crew and nice free drinks. An inflight snack might have been nice but overall a pleasant experience.
I will never again book with Ryanair the poorest customer service I have ever received in my life. We booked our flights out to Pisa for our Wedding this August 11 months later last Sept and just 2 weeks after booking they changed our flights by 5.5 hrs going out and 7 hrs coming back. To add insult we paid for their most expensive flights to get good flight times to make the most of our Wedding holiday as did 40 of our guests too and they put us onto their cheapest night flights that are still selling online now dirt cheap. Its 4.5 months on since they changed our online booking no notification we just found by fluke by logging in but when we rang they said they cannot change the flight until it is confirmed then we will receive an email to be able to request a refund or accept the new flights. I call every month and email every month but I get the same text book answer you can change your flights when you receive your email of the change which could be up until 3 months prior to your flight date So Ryanairs customer service answer is wait 6 months until all other flight prices are sky high so we cant afford to request a refund and must accept our overly inflated cost of night flights as we bought them under false pretenses. We have 10 children all under the age of 10 with us some are babies and were now stranded on a flight home at 10pm after we lose our accommodation at 10am due to Ryanairs poor duty of care and customer service.
LHR to Amman Jordan Airbus 321. Outward flight delayed 2 hours due to unloading a bag and technical problems on the ground. Flight completely full upgraded to Club World. Cabin crew there excellent and attentive. Seat comfort was OK but not special. Food was good. One very small toilet next to the pilot door for Club World passengers. Terminal 1 on its last legs but check in was quick. Return trip was in Economywhat a difference
Air France from Paris CDG to New York JFK Business Class A380800 seat 67A This is a mammoth jet and business class seats are in the old side by side style i.e. no privacy. Its kind of awkward sleeping next to a stranger and climbing over to get up. Still the set up is quite roomy. If you travel with all sorts of small carryons as I do get a window seat which has its own storage bin next to it. The food was almost uniformly very good. Foie gras salmon tartare... Unfortunately the duck was grossly overcooked and swam very unattractively in a sea of orange something it actually tasted good but was about as appetizing as baby food. The service was extraordinary
We flew from Tokyo to Sapporo and the baggage sizeallowance was absurd. One of my carry on luggage exceeded the total size by 5cm due to a slightly elongated handle and the service crew didnt allow it and insisted to be checked in with additional cost. The manager came by and initially said ok to bring on board but the service attendant kept insisting I needed to pay for check in. I eventually gave in and paid the 10k Yen but really just a 5 cm at that cost I have never encountered a worse airline than this.
Toronto to Barcelona. Purchasing the tickets was a complete nightmare. The website kept getting errors and I could not book the dates I wanted. Customer service helped me over the phone advised they apologized and because of the Mishap they would place me in a better seat free of charge with extra legroom. I am in the plane right now. If your guessing I dont have extra legroom youre right. I also never ended up getting the dates I wanted because the representative kept getting the same error as I got initially. Fast forward to the airport. Get on the plane no entertainment. Pay for WiFi or use their App is the entertainment. I went online took out my gift card and it turns out they dont accept their own gift card. Whatever I pay. They bring the food that is included. Its not good at all. I wait for someone to come to ask if I want anything else. No one for about and hour and a half. So I press the service button on the elbow rest. No one came for another roughly 20 minutes. I get up and walk all to the back of plane and ask for Their meal combo. Turns out they dont have combos on international flight. They dont have any additional food on this flight except for chips. I buy anyway because theres another 5 hours left and I have a gift card... but they dont accept their own gift cards for food either. So its basically useless now with the remaining balance.... How am I going to spend 120 remaining on a gift card if I can only use it for plane tickets I only have 6 months to use it or lose it.
Absolutely disgraceful inflight experience in business class. Plastic glasses no champagne no gin and tonic and then no white wine. Offered cheap prossecco which then ran out. To charge this money and not offer a fully stocked bar is unacceptable. The salad was disgusting. Worse than this at check in the agent told us the business lounge was at gate e41 so we went miles to get there and as my husband is registered disabled this was quite a long walk. We were told at the lounge that ITA didnt have use of this lounge but we had to go back to gate 11 miles back. so we sat and waited at gate e44 for an hour and a half when we could have enjoyed the business lounge had that agent given us correct information. This was such a poor experience. I left a complaint with the purser who said they didnt have much loaded since the pandemic If the cabin is full you stock a full bar and provide a good meal maybe even some italian cheese and biscuits. Not even a hot towel. Poorall round.
Seats that we paid for and confirmed very much earlier had been unfairly reassigned later on to another person who was their preferred customer without first obtaining our consent or approval SIA customer service initially informed us the seat was reassigned due to flight schedule change but it turned out to be false. When they realized they were wrong they subsequently changed their position to cancellation and rebooking of our flight by their customer service agents. We did not cancel the flight but it was an error committed by their customer agent. . When the customer service agent rebooked our flight they ensured us that our original seats selection would be the same. We periodically checked with the customer service agents to ensure that our original seats selection were intact. They confirmed and reconfirmed that our original paid seats were unchanged. We also went on to their online booking website to confirm that our original seat selections remained intact. On checking in 2 days before flight we discovered that one of our paid seats was reassigned to another customer without our prior knowledge and approval. We discovered our seat was reassigned to a standard seat to the back of the plane. Immediately. we called the customer service agents immediately on the phone to reinstate our paid seats back but they refused to do it. The customer service agents on the phone did not converse well in English and they gave us all the wrong information about the seat change. It was extremely difficult to get through to them on the phone and we had to wait for a long time before we could speak to someone. The duty manager at airport informed us our paid seat had been changed last minute due to a preferred customer had kicked us out due to his importance. It was unprofessional and unethical for them to do that. We had to fight and argue fervently all the way through at each encounter. Even at the gate we had to fight and argue to get our seat back after seeking approval from the preferred customer. Escalated the complaints to the senior management CEO several times who did not even respond to our complaints.. Actual costs incurred to resolve the airline mistakes amounted to SGD429.65 and they only agreed to issue a voucher of SGD75 which is inadequate to compensate for the actual costs incurred. Moreover it does not include the additional inherent cost of lost vacation time and stressfrustrations to deal with their mistakes that they had created for us unnecessarily. Customer service investigation focused mainly on the outcome but do not provide fair customer resolution to their mistakes they had committed. The last response received from the customer service agent was that they are happy with the investigation and no further communication and action would be taken i.e. refused to address their mistakes committed and refused to compensate the costs that we had incurred.
Kuala Lumpur to Sapporo via Tokyo. This was my first family trip to Sapporo via Tokyo and my first time flying with ANA. No doubt that this airline is a 5 star airlines. From ticket price checkin departure delayed for almost 1 hour on that day meals seats although a bit cramp everything is up to my satisfaction. Just one thing that I would like to highlight is the good and friendly service from cabin crew service went a little overboard. During meal serving session cabin crew attending to the same passengers who already have their meals and drinks distributed these passengers keep on requesting for more drinks and left the rest of the passengers who have not got their meal and drinks waited.
I really cant believe they have the audacity to call this First Class. The check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpful. The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed so theyre using a cheap generic alternative which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine which came filled to the brim. I mean its First Class not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry over cooked and tough and whichever catering manger signed off on a canape of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat 1K which they were in and out of all night and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat so were in and out of that as well. I will say the seat itself is very well designed but personally Im happy in Club and would never do First again.
We travelled Cancun to LGW in business class. To the point I didnt think the experience was as good as Virgin and Emirates who I normally use. Airport staff were helpful although I was surprised there was no lounge access at all we got 2x USD 22 vouchers for the restaurants in the airport. Cabin crew were not particularly attentive or helpful. Dinner and winedrinks were nice although cabin crew had to be prompted to serve drinks again after dinner. Seat and space was ok although functionality on seat not as good as Emirates or Cathay. My friend had no direct access to aisle and had to jump over another passengers legs. Breakfast was sub standard.
New York to London via Casablanca. Royal Air Maroc have really made huge improvements. I just had a wonderful flight from New York to Casablanca. The plane was brand new with a gorgeous interior. The seats in business were comfortable and lieflat. Great crew too very lovely and proud of their company. Food was good and plentiful. The flight from Casablanca to London was on an older plane. The interior was a little beaten up but still a lovely crew. Casablanca was an easy airport to transfer although the airport is old and not very nice.
Hyderabad to Mumbai. Absolutely horrifying experience with the staff after a delay due to heavy rains in Mumbai. The staff had no information no updates given to passengers. Later our boarding passes were revoked since they wanted us to fly by another airline after 7 hours of delay and only to find out that the other airline is already full and boarding gates have been closed. There was chaos at the airport clueless till then end about their actual journey to Mumbai.
Ranchi to Bangalore. This was my first and last time traveling with AirAsia India. It was okay when the flight was rescheduled but got frustrated after taking boarding pass flight got rescheduled again 1 hour. I can understand there will be rescheduling but this is a very bad experience. Had a bad time for over 3 hours in this flight.
Chengdu to Los Angeles. We really enjoyed this flight. The cabin was clean service was excellent. The food and entertainment were met my expectation. When they handed me a new pajama for sleeping comfort I was very surprised. I highly recommend this flight and I wont go to Chengdu any other way.
Checkin very slow. No app checkin and could not check my vaccine QR code online. Check in staff friendly but too few of them. BA Silver card holder and no Stockholm lounge to use. Boarding fine but plane was worn out. Seats close together and row 30 even worse. Crew really professional and happy it seemed. Arrival at Heathrow a total shambles. BA777 landed at 12.50 no gate so waited and waited for 25 minutes. Then BA jetty didnt work. Then BA had no steps. Very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the steps. Everyone was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watch. So BA skimping on lounge plane condition and gate. Crew good seats very uncomfortable.
Hong Kong to London via Mumbai. The most uncomfortable and stressful connection Ive ever experienced. The first flight from Hong Kong was too hot and the second flight to London was too cold. The juice wasnt juice just sugary orange liquid. The movies are OK and seats were as expected. The security in Mumbai was very slow and resulted in nearly missing my connection. Although a very cheap price the overall experience was not good.
Toronto to Tehran via Istanbul. This flight and airport was the worst travel experience we had. The flight from Toronto to Istanbul departed the Pearson Airport with one hour delay. There was very unusual turbulence almost through more than half the flight time from Toronto to Istanbul and we couldnt sleep. After arriving at Istanbul airport we had about 6 hours layover time. We decided to spent this time in the town. On our way back to airport due to getting caught in traffic jam we reached the boarding gate after closing the gate while the airplane still was stopped at the gate. The staff didnt let us to get onboard and we missed our flight from Istanbul. After missing our flight we were told to go to the Care Point counter. This was the first office which we were referred to. They didnt provide us with any help and told us to go to the ticket sale office. Finding the right ticket sale office was like a marathon for us. There were several counters for ticket sale with Turkish Airline logo. After talking to two ticket sale office we finally were directed to the main Turkish Airlines ticket sale office where we were told that they are not able to help us and we have to pay the full price for the business class for the flights in the next day. After that they asked us to talk to the supervisor where we observed the worst treatment that a customer may experience. He even didnt let us to explain our story and didnt listen to us. He just asked us to contact customer care centre by phone. After about 15 minutes talk with customer care centre over the phone they also told us that they are not able to help us. Finally after being passed to several offices and people by Turkish Airlines staff without getting any help we decided to buy new tickets to Isfahan Iran instead of Tehran for the next day from an agency at the airport. The new tickets were sold to us at full price without any discount for the missed flight. I showed the new tickets to the same supervisor to transfer our luggage to the new destination and also complained about his behavior with us. After all of these unpleasant stories we went to the Turkish Airlines Hotel Desk where they told us that because our tickets are new and not transit tickets they cannot help us with accommodations in Istanbul and we were forced to book a hotel from an agency at the airport.
Never again will I fly with Volaris. Trust me spend the extra cash to get a genuine on time flight. Not only do you have to pay for extra which includes bags seats and much more. But the hassle of flying with them is not worth it. The crew is ok a mediocre job for a mediocre airline. My flight was just under two hours late of the boarding time but that was enough to make me write a review. I have never felt more disappointed in an airline than Volaris. The plane arrive late but within 15 minutes we were already boarding. Which is good only if you like sitting in nasty chip crumbs filled seats that arent even properly sanitized. I guess thats why COVID was such a problem in Mexico.
Bamako to Algiers. A 2115 flight was delayed around 2130. This was the first we heard anything. At around 2230 we were told the plane would take off the next day. We were fed by 2300. Around 0000 shuttles started to a hotel. I got yelled at by airline personnel while boarding a shuttle. The last of us got to the hotel around 230 where we were dropped off with no information. The hotel was absolutely horrid. The hotel personnel shared no flight information so around noon the next day I asked for a number for the Air Algerie personnel whod made the reservation. He picked up after about 3 calls and told me not to call back. Around 1700 we were told to be ready to depart at 0000. Around 2340 2 shuttles came. There was a mad unorganized rush to board the shuttles because there wasnt enough space. I got pushed and shoved but left behind. One shuttle left the hotel without having its door closed. Around 0030 another shuttle came and I managed to get on. After standing in line at the airport for an hour I got a new boarding pass. I was assured that the luggage that I had handed over the previous day would be on the plane. Service on the flight was fairly decent. Plane landed around 800 and took off fine. The seat was absolutely filthy however and the bathroom was disgusting. My luggage did not come in. I tried to report my luggage as lost but was told I could not because I had no baggage claim tickets theyd been taken by the airline when I got my new boarding pass. I was told to come back the next morning at 300. I got yelled at again while reporting the luggage lost. Another passenger said that a plane from Bamako was coming in at noon and we should wait so I did. luggage came in around 1230.
On Friday May 19th the flight 0638 departure time 320PM from Toronto got cancelled and we got notified by email at noon time on that day which was not enough notice to rearrange our plane as we already went to the airport. We also lost one day of work as we could have gone to work that day.
London to Hong Kong in May 2017. Check in extremely helpful efficient and with a smile. Boarding went smoothly. Cabin crew provided excellent service from preflight drinks lunch and breakfast. Nothing was too much of a bother. The amenities bag was useful. We had both Asian and Western Foods for lunch and breakfast. They were excellent especially the wine. Inflight Entertainment was superb. There was much choice and the supplied headphones excellent. The latest film releases were available. Arrival we went to the Cathay Pacific Lounge in Hong Kong Airport.
Poor customer service and they just dont care. Flew JFK to CDG with no issues but on return trip before entering passport control they made me weigh my carryon bag which was 12kg. They then made me add my personal item backpack with computer to the scale and told me I was overweight and needed to check my bag. Very rude and unprofessional. Charged me 50 to check a carry on size bag that has been all around the world on dozens of airlines. Will not fly Air France again and neither should you
Glasgow to London. Smooth flight departurearrival on time. Boarding was quick the seat was ok. Although I had preordered a vegetarian option the caterer hadnt provided any so they said but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue. The food was good and the wine french Bourgogne also surprisingly good. Flight attendant was professional polite and attentive to detail. All in all a great flight.
During eckeckin I could change the assigned seat to first row without paying extra. Boarding was done with paxbridge. The flight was almost full and we departed on time. Aircraft was new and clean. Staff were polite and they offer in flight service for the 45 minute flight.
London Heathrow to Berlin Tegel. A good flight. Food is good for a shorthaul flight in business class but I note that there is no longer free snack and drink in Economy. Now they sell MS stuff. But the question is whether it is worth the while flying business shorthaul. I did only because it is one of my long haul segments. I expect nothing and it turn out to exceed my expectation.
Sao Paulo to Buenos Aires with TAM Airlines. On time depature and arrival. Cabin clean crew attentive. Simple breakfast served in a bag plenty of juices coffee etc. Cockpit announcements on take off and landing. Had to deplane by bus but probably the fault of the chaotic airport. Too much carry on bagagge allowed and not enough space. Why can t the airline staff at the boarding gate do something about it
Check in was late opening and the agent was very unfriendly. However there was no queue. Tbilisi Airport is very easy and quick to navigate through and Georgian Airways use a thirdparty lounge Prime Class which you see as soon as you get through passport control. The lounge is fantastic. Boarding was very quick but no priority boarding was offered. The aircraft was changed from an E190 to a CRJ200 which was quite old and rather uncomfortable. The business class seats were European short haul style ie normal seats with very little legroom and even less width. For a 30 minute flight it was fine but I wouldnt have wanted to spend any longer on it The service consisted of a pre departure bottle of water and a drink during the flight. I obviously dont expect a meal on such a short flight but some kind of snack would have been appreciated but they didnt have anything The crew were very pleasant and spoke good English. No communication from the pilots however. We left and arrived early. For a short hop Id have no problem flying Georgian again though I would think twice before booking a longer trip.
Flawless flight. There was a slight delay because runway was busy but we still made it only 25 minutes behind schedule. The toilet should be cleaned better during the flight.
One of the worst experience for our upcoming flight from Mumbai to Zurich via Istanbul we have paid full amount for seat selections but due to there technical issue and IT problem we are wating for allotment of seats even after repeated calls to Customer Care Support who are completely unsupportive and not able to understand the problem of passenger the problem is not resolved pathetic staff and customer support who are not even able to understand English language. How come they are been hired while taking money in advance is fine but solving the passengers problem they need 10 days time limit wow what a gesture by the airline company. I would say that Indian airline companies are better than this at least they understand the passengers problem. even after paying full amount for seat selection the seats are not allotted and calling them for the same is waste of time and its like banging your head. Worst third grade rating for the Airline Staff
VTELPQ in business. Checkin was slow as economy passengers used the business line. There was also no priority boarding for business passengers. On this very short flight we were given a cold towel served juice and a pack of chips. I didnt pay much more for a business seat as compared to an economy ticket so it was still worth it.
Flew Mahe Seychelles to Doha. As always Qatar Airways gives you a great travel experience. Clean new airplane and a very great crew. Selection of wine is splendid and food served when you like to eat gives you to time to work have a nap or what watch a movie. Just a great experience. Only downside is that even in business class you have to pay extra for WiFi.
This flight failed at every level. We were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another 10 minutes for us but this was a BA holiday. We pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound British Airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in Heathrow. As there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on Wednesday evening. Having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday. I might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available. I would like to make it clear that we are British airways bronze level holders which as we have been long retired shows how we have used this airline historically.
Our first flight since the pandemic. Check in at LGW was quick and efficient. Made our way to the Emirates lounge as we had a couple of hours to spare. Service was good in the lounge and after about 15 minutes they served a hot lunch. The Goan Chicken Curry was pleasant. Flight boarded and departed on time. My wife and I had seats 14E and 14F which are ideal for a couple travelling together. At the time of travel masks were mandatory Emirates provided spare masks and sanitizer. The food service on Emirates used to be quite drawn out but with the new system they take the meal selection from the passengers on a hand held device and it seems to be delivered in quite an efficient manner. I chose the Arabic Mezze which was very tasty followed by the Beef Tenderloin which was also good. Good choice of wine available. Emirates only serve one meal on the flight from Gatwick to Dubai which we found to be sufficient. Snacks and sandwiches are available at any time either delivered to your seat or from the bar. Overall a very good flight with Emirates.
Montreal to London and return to Toronto. OW leg from Montreal was the most average club experience to date. Poor third party lounge with little food choice disappointing wines and little ambience. Boeing 787800 aircraft was substituted by Boeing 787900 which was good on the face of it except the same seat number moved me from the last row of biz to the one in front of the toilets annoying as gate staff unable to move me. With the air bridge withdrawn the plane went tech due to a power issue. Two hours later after a total reboot of the aircraft systems we took off. Excellent updates from captain. However cabin crew were absent during the delay with Biz passengers including me having to ask for a glass of water. Bizarrely First was blocked off with lights off and vigorously enforced with no access to the front bathroom. Drinks and dinner served promptly. My choice of fruit for breakfast had already run out. Only 4 loaded for the whole of biz with honey and yogurt offered which turned out to be a 99 cent pot plonked on a plate. No croissant offered left in oven in error and the orange juice has been downgraded to UHT out of a carton. On the return leg from Heathrow T5 the club lounge was very disappointing. Shabby condition poor food and drink service by the third party provider with dirty scruffy toilets which I had to queue for. Worst lounge experience to date and cannot be called first class by any means. Prompt boarding on a 777200 with the first entrance blocked off. The cabin manager was by herself and so we were pointed towards first class. Friendly crew prompt champagne and a prompt drinks service after take off. recovered things a tad. IFE had not changed since my flights in October which was disappointing. The amenities bag in first is now the old club world offering. Average menu with the usual suspects of Beef Chicken and Cod but were cooked and presented really well. The promised cheese plate had already run out only 4 loaded. seeing a theme here and so cheese was fetched from club. Afternoon tea sandwiches were dry and bland. In the race to the bottom BA continue to cut service especially on the food front. I dont find it acceptable in first class for something as simple as cheese to run out with club food being substituted. This may save money and wasted food but the crew whilst cheerfully making the best of a bad job are not being given the food or or product to deliver first class service. In fact the crew were the only saving grace. BA dont seem to get it. Even in premium cabins they continue to downgrade service to save money and gain an even worse reputation as the UKs flag carrier. Biz and First Class products are dropping at an alarming rate. Wake up BA and IAG before its too late.
Frankfurt to Windhoek with Air Namibia. Overall a nice flight friendliness of staff above average. Food drinks above average. Selection from 3 different meals quick service drinks also with alcohol before and after the meals. Age of the aircrafts under 3 years means almost new. Entertainment system with highres 10 adjustable screen and some new movies at every seat. Seat legroom average. Newspapers magazines only for business class.
Doha to London Heathrow via Bahrain. As a loyal British Airways customer for 20 years I have noticed wide variations in the type of flight attendant service and mealbeverage service provided on longhaul flights. BAs longhaul Club World seat is showing its age compared to the competition but I like the seat cushion. Having to jump over someones feet to access a window seat is not ideal. AVOD quality varies depending on the type and age of the aircraft and storage space for small items also varies. Service onboard was good from BAH to LHR and meal service was good despite costcutting at BA being evident in recent years. The washrooms were reasonable but not up to the standard of competitors. The flight was on time and my bags transferred at LHR to my next flight to the USA.
SATA Air Azores was the worst airline I have ever taken and I travel often. First the plane was canceled due to operational issues. It was canceled for two days. So I lost two days of my vacation and this airline would not reimburse me anything except a hotel night for those two days. I was stuck in Boston for two days. I had to rearrange my entire trip to extend the trip for the two days I lost which cost me money. The airline said they wouldnt do anything for me. The seats are small the food was horrible the flight attendants were not nice and the airplane was so hot I thought half of us were going to pass out. This airline was so bad that although I would love to come back to the islands if I have to fly this airline I probably would not. I am not normally a negative person and I realize as a world traveler that things are different everywhere but this airline was the worst I have flown.
Bangkok to London in business class and a truly excellent flight. The EVA lounge at BKK airport is fabulous and far far better than anything Thai Airways offer at this airport their home airport. Staff friendly food great and really nice lounge design and decor. Boarding was quick cabin staff very friendly and efficient throughout the flight and lived up to 5 star expectations. Lunch served shortly after departure and a light meal before arrival into London food standards and meal presentation were very good. Definitely choose EVA again on this route as they exceed anything that BA or Thai offer.
During the pandemic the flight was not allowed to depart so i decided to call Citilink for the refund and continue the process starting from April 2020 until now. The refund center remain silent and no response from May 2020 until now. I also asked on April 2020 if my refund can be change to voucher or reschedule but the answer is no because I have been proceed with refund process. but on August 2020 when I follow up the refund process they give me the answer that the dont know how the refund will be done so they asked me to process the voucher refund. honestly if they told me during April 2020 I will directly process the voucher refund. but that time they said you can not process the voucher refund because I already process the money refund. So right now Citilink only silent and waiting for me to change from money refund to ticket refund.
I booked my flight to Orlando and back to Charleston SC for a healthcare conference for Thursday March 24th Monday March 27th. It was no problem with Delta to get to Orlando easily and smoothly but once Monday came Silver Airways was a nightmare and continues to be. First thing flight got delayed and delayed and delayed so we ended up with an email saying 712 pm flight out and then their website saying 611 pm the former delay prior to this. Our flight time out of Orlando was originally 235 pm. Thats fine flights get delayed I get that. No problem. So as we stood in line for over an hour we began to realize we werent moving and still not moving much and we were going to miss our flight. The people all in front of us were angry because of the lack of service and common sense the Silver Airways staff showed. The lack of simple Im sorry that your flight is cancelled but heres what you can do didnt exist and when it was our turn and we had just missed the flight this is about 715 pm now we walk up and speak to the agent who has no idea what to do and says that. Literally says to us I dont know what to do and what you want me to do excuse me So after asking her what can we do How do we reroute She informs us in a nasty tone and attitude that they dont do that. They didnt help. They didnt do a thing and refused to help. Then when I shared that I booked with Expedia she said thats not their fault or problem. I cannot believe this. The attitude. The lack of help. The lack of doing their jobs and no refund thus far. Weve made a few calls and Expedia stated today at 500 pm I needed to call the Silver Airways phone lines which both lines no one answers on. No one. The 801 just puts you on hold while the 954 is disconnected. Silver Airways you owe me my flight 448.98 and a hotel stay since I had to go find out at another airline American Airlines to go home and had to wait the night out the Hyatt Hotel at the airport.
Doha to Bali and return. Outward journey was very good as soon as we were seated FA came round with pyjamas a nice touch but unfortunately too small for me. Cabin service was excellent with the dine on demand feature welcome we had eaten in Doha airport so werent too hungry on the way out. Seats were comfortable with room to get round the fully reclined seat of neighbouring passenger. Plenty of leg and arm room and the food and drink on offer was good. Managed to sleep for part of the journey and enjoyed the flight. The return journey was also very good with excellent service from the cabin services director. Due to feeling unwell I did not take any food but was kept well supplied with water by the cabin crew. On both flights the toilets were kept very clean and well stocked. Both flights departed on time although when leaving Bali we were delayed at the runway access for 20 minutes waiting for an incoming flight. On this experience I would recommend Qatar Airways.
SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make. I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I cant find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates.
Mexico City to Barcelona via London Heathrow. The B787 is an incredible plane. The legroom is quite good the seat is comfortable and the IFE has a great number of movies series and music. The food is average the first meal was meat with mashed potatoes salad and wine. Not very tasty. The breakfast was scrambled eggs with mushrooms fruit and a muffin it was delicious The cabin crew was ok. Not bad not excellent. We arrived on time and was a great flight. On the second flight the cabin crew appeared twice. No IFE no onboard service. Its almost like a low cost. I recommend for long flights but not for European flights.
I booked the ticket for my mother on 15.3.2023 from Sharjah to Calicut. The ticket was booked 60 days prior to traveling and direct booking from Air Arabia portal. It was with return ticket and my mother already travelled from Calicut to Sharjah 45 days back. We reached the airport two and half hours before flying and they informed your ticket is on hold. They made us to wait in the area for the entire two and half hours and informed the flight do not have seat. The airline is so rude that they do not even care about a senior lady traveling alone and did not in any manner addressed their mistake. They did not even send any notification.
London to Dubai inflight entertainment didnt work and food very average. Durban to Dubai slightly better food live footy was a nice touch. Return journey I upgraded to business class but was unable to use the lounge as this was a promo fare. Seat comfortable. Service good. Disappointing food once again and would not upgrade again. Dubai to London food ok all in all I wouldnt rush back or recommend but not a lot of choices around to Durban
Auckland to Sydney with Emirates. From CheckIn to Lounge access everything was very smooth. The Flight Attendents on board was the highlight of my trip home. They were kind and attentive making sure everything from serving food and drinks to attending small needs was met with a smile. Nothing was too much which makes this the best crew I have flown with. The Business Class was quite empty but then it was only a three hour flight on such a large aircraft. Food was delicious cabin clean and a very private and comfortable seat with plenty of storage. I would not hesitate to fly with Emirates again.
Dalaman to Istanbul. Well the seat was okay. The food was just a sandwich and it wasnt really fresh. Cabin crew was nice and friendly. Drinks are standard. The pilots announcements were not understandable almost every pilot at Turkish Airlines cant speak English clearly I dont know what kind of exam they pass.
This company is terrible. From the customer service to the hidden fees to the inconsistent fees to blaming everyone else. Our flight was delayed 6 hours received an email saying my flight was updated but no change to flight departure. Sat in the airport in Toronto from 6 am until 1 pm. Then we were taxied around for about 35 minutes to the plane where we sat for another 1 hour. Seat assignment was only for some people the lady sitting beside me did not have an assigned seat but upon check in my fiance and I were told we must have an assigned seat. Be consistent. We checked a bag they lost the bag. The guy checking it in did not care at all about us checking in he also knew about the delay but didnt say anything. When we found out where the bag was lost turns out he didnt put it in place to actually be delivered to be on the plane. It didnt leave Toronto. He also could not figure out how to check it in so just said its free rather than following steps. No wonder it was lost. Upon arriving we couldnt find anyone from Lynx to find out where our bag was. Staff left. We dealt with someone from another airline. Upon checking in to come home spent 2 hours on hold to only give up assuming they were not staffed a 15 minute wait time was a bit ridiculous to be 2 hours and counting. We called the next morning within 2 minutes of opening took 45 minutes to speak to an agent who told us we didnt have a return flight and wouldnt look into it. He literally said Im not sure figure it out. Upon getting boarding passes we had to pay to check in our carry on we did not on the way here Flight was delayed again. We had a layover in Calgary coming back. A 3045 min delay was over 2.5 hours potentially more gave up on time tracking. No meal voucher provided but Lynxs website says they will provide. If I could give a negative stars review I would.
London Heathrow to Perth via Hong Kong. You learn a lot about a business when things go wrong. Ive learned today that CP struggle greatly to deal with difficulties. My premium economy flight was originally scheduled for 1715 to Perth via Hong Kong but was subject to repeated delays until my connection was under threat. The people in the lengthy queue at the desk informed me the flight was unlikely to leave and that staff were rebooking people to other flights even other airlines. I waited for more than two hours in the queue eventually to be told that there were two options available . I could take the first leg in the 5 hour delayed original flight with no onward connection available until 24 hours after the original resulting in a full day delay. My other option was to fly another airline to Sydney via Singapore with a lengthy wait there until a connection to Perth the latter leg in economy and around 14 hours delay. No upgrades were offered despite those delays and the inconvenience. I asked about being upgraded and was very reluctantly offered business class on the first leg only on the first option. That apparently is the very best they could do for me. During the conversation I was invited to explore other routes and options myself online if I thought I could do better told that I should appreciate that they hadnt deliberately planned this disruption and informed that they were dealing with lots of people in the same situation as though I was somehow not appreciating fully their problems and being rather selfish in the circumstances. I wont be flying with them again after this trip And Ill be spreading the word around our Australiabased business not because they had a problem with my flight but because their response to it was haphazard and unsatisfactory.
This was the second flight segment for my return trip to Vancouver. The shorter BKK to TPE flight was flawless and I was eager to see how the longer 10 hour flight would play out. I was not disappointed in the least Ive never encountered such kind and engaged flight crew members. The boarding process was calm and organized and I was met with a genuine smile at each point. I was shown to my Royal Laurel seat which offered great privacy and comfort. Soon after the glass of Veuve Clicquot champagne and hot towel on a tray I was presented with comfortable pajamas slippers and a hard shell Rimowa amenity kit. Food and beverage choices were ample and very well presented. My only suggestion would be to expand the IFE range of selections. The highlight for me however comes back to the absolutely wonderful cabin crew. The five star rating is truly well deserved
New aircraft but there ends the positives. LAN Airlines website is very poor and online checkin clunky. I would suggest that LAN scraps its poor website and keeps up with the rest of the OneWorld alliance. At present it is a poor relative. Bag drop was not a pleasant experience rude staff who were not interested. Boarding was shambolic also. Plane dirty with food from previous flight on tray table. Food and drinks service was also pretty hit and miss. Getting off the plane also took an age.
Booked a flight through Delta their partner so I was unable to add baggage buy a seat or add any services note that booking through LATAM a few months prior did not present me with any difficulties when dealing with Delta. I called went to the airport a day before went to their main office in Lima etc. No one could tell me the price of a second piece of luggage. Online it varies from 60 to 200. Show up at the airport and I was charged 177. When I asked why they said I was penalized for not purchasing the bag before. When I mentioned that its literally impossible to do this she simply asked so do you want to check it or not. The airline is in bankruptcy. I really hope someone replaces them.
Tokyo to Osaka. Peach Aviation have to improve your carryon policy. I can understand if you have security issues that large objects would be an obstruction to go on full flights as carryon but my object was a fragile guitar and the flight was half full. There was plenty of overhead locker space. Instead of telling the customer the size rules Peach Aviation would be more customer friendly in an agreement on negotiating a reasonable carryon solution for guitars like most European airlines do.
Istanbul to Izmir. I am not happy at all with the customer service received I complaint and they didn t give me any satisfying solution several texts were sent and calls were made neither give me correct information in the airport when I ask for my damage in the suitcase a wheel out and a whole. At the end they decided that 20 USD refund was enough for all the irregularities and for not arising out of this damage against the airline employees director subcontracters and agents they should head drop in shame they told me to sign a letter. I had to carry a three wheel suitcase and buy another one in my holidays besides plenty of time wasted.
The worst flight from Montreal to Toronto they canceled the flight 5 hours before departure and I was waiting at the domestic airport after security no assistance from customer support or airport representatives everyone is just saying to mail customer service. Will never take and will also tell family and friends to never take this airline in the future dont mind paying more for a better quality airline.
Timika to Nabire. Flight was nearly on time. Aircraft was clean crew attentive. Inflight meal was the one disappointment consisting of two tiny spongy breadrolls and a bag of peas and nuts.
Outbound British Airways flight from London to Rio de Janeiro demonstrated the difference a decent crew can make to a flight. The staff in Club World were all male and mature and delivered an excellent service. British Airways seating arrangement in Club World is looking increasingly outdated but a less than half full cabin meant that one was less bothered by ones neighbours. Food was reasonable although it was surprising how quickly menu options ran out. IFE had a good selection of films but the resolution of the screens is poor. No queues at border control and priority baggage handling meant that we were in our taxi within 20 minutes of leaving the plane.
We frequently use British Airways morning flight from Boston to London and will again but the reduction in the quality of food served in economy is startling. The English Breakfast choice was a pleasant surprise until this last flight on which the reduction of portion size and quality was noticeable. The pre landing snack had always been a decent chicken salad sandwich but on this flight it was a cookie maybe two I forget. The cabin crew was efficient and friendly and the AVOD was excellent much improved from the older 747s which we have had on the route. Beware however Fast Track security at Heathrow which twice in the last six months has been glacial no better than regular lines.
Singapore to Amsterdam. Great service in business class. The seats are comfortable and the sky bed opens flat for a good nights sleep. The timing of this flight is great because it leaves at midnight and by the time dinner is served it is between 2 to 3 am. This gives some adjustment to jet lag and arrives in Amsterdam in the morning. I started sneezing due to sinuses and the air stewardess promptly gave me a large pack of tissues which came in handy. The entertainment selection was good although I think Qatar is more current in terms of movie selection. Book the cook never fails. My bak chor mee came with vinegar on the side. For breakfast I had the healthy red rice fish porridge which doesnt sound great but is really amazing. I started off to a busy work day well thanks to Singapore Airlines.
Atrocious customer service the landline never answered online complaint form never answered or vaguely answered or rarely answered. They also remove amend cancel what you have type on their online form what they call eticket so as to hide their suspicious activities or behaviour. You have to fight to get your money back if you still have energy left after 3 months of constant harassment from me let alone 1 year if it happens that you need to claim a refund. It has been a very traumatic experience for me and as far as Im concerned this would be the last time I will be taking this airline.
We booked the return flights for two people last October via Opodo and couldnt go due to the Covid restriction. We cancelled the flights immediately and Opodo helped us proceed. However the airline company Air Austral did not issue the refund even when they have confirmed the cancellation. And every time we asked about it they threw the problem to Covid which is not reasonable. It has been 5 months already that they did not proceed the refund.
Fantastic from the word go. Check in was great Concorde lounge great along with the spa elemis treatment which was lovely. Good service and attention to detail. Crew onboard delightful. Food was nice and was a real pleasure.
I checked in early via self check in and dropped my bag off easily. We boarded about half hour late but being a short flight it didnt matter to me personally. Boarding was split into front and rear boarding. Full flight. Seats a little cramped but ok for this short hop. Coffee and tea were served free and entertainment can be accessed via their app. All in all an uneventful flight. My bag took about half hour to arrive.
Im doing all I can to avoid using Turkish Airlines ever again. The tickets costed about 800 but I ended up paying an extra 1000 because of them. I was headed from LA to Montenegro via Istanbul. Once I landed in Istanbul I saw my flight was cancelled to Montenegro. No email or phone notification just on the boards upon arrival. They told me the next one would be the following morning and when I asked why they said they dont know. But since its COVID so many people on my flight were going to have our tests expire if we had such a long layover as most countries dont allow international layovers longer than 8 hours. So I had to pay for a sketchy VISA at the airport go through customs go get another COVID and wait for the results in the middle of the night. I got my results went back to the terminal waited another few hours and guess what they cancelled the rescheduled flight a couple hours before takeoff. Now my fellow passengers were furious because they were giving no reason for the cancelled flights and just said they can cover our hotels. I asked when the next flight would be and they said they dont know but probably tomorrow turns out it was about 36 hours later keep in mind most countries dont accept COVID tests older than 72 hours especially if youve had a layover. I then asked if theres any guarantee that the flight wont be cancelled a third time and they said they dont know. So I got to the airport on friday it was now nearing sunday and I started work monday. I told them I might just have to drive but to get me as close to Montenegro as possible. They put me on a cheap flight to Serbia which was delayed by a couple of hours one hour of which the passengers were sitting on a crowded bus outside of the terminal as they deiced the plane. On top of this passengers on both my LAIST flight and ISTBelgrade flight werent wearing masks and it didnt seem to bother the flight attendants. So I got to Serbia had to get a hotel on my own dime and another flight to Montenegro on my own dime. Im of course going to dispute the original ticket cost since they screwed me over and just sent me to an airport that seems to profit off of cancelled flights by not offering complimentary internet you have to pay a substantial fee every 12 hours by forcing you to buy a visa in cash if you now need a new covid tests and by offering pricy covid tests.
Germanwings flight from Berlin Tegel to Dusseldorf. Cabin crew were friendly and professional. Good late evening snack a cheese or salami sandwich chocolate bar and a small bottle of water. Too bad the there is no inflight entertainment.
After taking two more South American flights with LAN after incident reported here with loss of my suitcase etc I can safely say LAN has a problem. The flight attendants are very friendly and the food is not bad but ground staff is not helpful arrogant and indifferent. But what is more worrying is that this airline is frantically buying new planes but sends its very old ones to the Lima Bogota or Quito based local airlines. So from Lima to Miami I had a very very old 767. From seat 1A the toilet smell was pretty strong and unpleasant. So while you will travel in a lovely Boeing 787 to USA Australia Europe or Brazil if you depart Santiago if you depart Lima or Bogota you will get a very old aircraft. The business class seat on the 767 was extremely uncomfortable one of the worst ever.
COVID19 means fewer passengers in the air. Good for travellers not so good for airlines. Our flight was on an older A320200 but the cabin was clean and the crew were ultrafriendly. There is a SkyBridge at Istanbuls IST airport unfortunately there is NO SkyBridge at Maltas MLA airport. The bottom line. We do wish they would bring back the Turkish Delights as a boarding gift.
Jakarta Halim Perdanakusuma to Yogyakarta. It was a Monday morning flight so it wasnt crowded both at the checkin queue and the boarding room. I got a little high price compared to another airlines in the same route. But it is no problem. Batik Air gives enough legroom except if you are more than 180 cm tall. And they give you a little snack some bread and a bottle of 330 ml mineral water. I think the service is okay. Unfortunately the IFE in this flight was inactive. But I dont care about IFE as long as it is a lessthantwohour flight.
My trip is over and I have still not received my bag. Horrible service. They do not answer phone calls or respond to emails. They literally left me high and dry. The fact that my holiday is over and still no correspondence from this retched airline I feel is reason enough not to fly with them. Honestly ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing time.
I wanted to travel from Islamabad to Madina for Umrah with my family. Obviously they offer cheaper option so I googled it to find out whether they accept umrah passengers The response to qurry was in affirmative so I booked from the website using credit card. Nowhere during the process I was alerted or warned about anything. As I reached the airport before departure I was told at check in counter that I was not permitted to travel on Umra visa through flynas. I returned home to process modification or refund. The website does not offer any option to launch complaint or cancel the booking. I contacted customer servive at Saudi Arabia where I was told that Flynas does not offer refund as per policy however they will offer me credit for subsequent travel on flynas for which I should call next morning. I called customer service centre again next morning. I was told since I had booked on website in light category so airline does not offer any change or cancellation and my money of almost 1100 stands wasted. I was also told that cancellation is offered only to the passengers travelling by business and first class. It is shocking that people travelling by economy light or premium class are otherwise underpreviliged and even they are made to suffer by skimming their money. So an extremely miserable and tortourous experience with the airline. It does not warn u before booking your journey. Lures you with cheaper offers and subsequently grabs your money. Completely shocked once customer service centre told me that we have grabbed your money and have no way out for you. Never choose this flight.
We had our tickets canceled due to COVID a year ago and we still cant get our refund back. They withdrew the money and do not want to return it. During the year they said we had to wait a little longer and they would return everything and 12 months had passed. Terrible customer service always say the same thing and then just hang up. It is better to spend more money than to order tickets from them again
CGNZRH return. Living close to the German border I can choose from three airports AMS DUS CGN and five airlines to fly to Zurich. Germanwings was by far the cheapest and I dont mind missing a drink on a 55 min flight. Paid 166 rtn for 2 incl one bag. Flights bang on time seat pitch ok thanks to new thinner seats good information from the cockpit. I just dont understand why they park near an aerobridge at CGN and directing us into a bus. Probably airport policy but maybe Germanwings can sort this out with CGN.
BangkokVientiane. The aircraft was clean a new ATR72500. Tuna sandwich with some choices of drinks. FAs were helpful and kind.
Heathrow to Toronto with British Airways. Fast checkin and security. Galleries Lounge very crowded poor food offering and the furniture and toilets were not very clean. Boarding started on time for a 1705 departure but was suddenly stopped when it was announced that there was a technical problem and a new departure time of 1955 was given. This was later amended to 2100 and later to 1500 the next day no details of the technical problem were provided. It is extraordinary that BA do not have a better resilience plan for these incidents when they occur at their home base such a lengthy delay is unacceptable. Hotelsmeals etc were organised fairly efficiently but not once was any offer made to reaccommodate on other flights until I made a fuss due to commitments the next day and was reluctantly booked on Air Canada at 0900 the next morning it had empty seats in both J and Y cabins. Several emails to BA Customer Service about this have yielded the usual stereotypical and nonsensical responses they have ensured that I will never travel with BA again we do have a choice.
Paid a full fare in business class from Luxembourg to Bahrain via Istanbul. First leg all went ok with A321 service and seat. Second leg was disaster chaotic boarding in Istanbul the aircraft has an older version of business class seats that didnt recline fully.
On December 24th 2022 my family were going on MH124. Immediately trouble occurred at check in. The people there said we need vaccine certificates to enter Bangladesh so we were urgently searching for them. However the immigration at Bangladesh didnt even bother to check if we had vaccine certificates so there was all that panic for nothing. The flight was pretty enjoyable since the IFE had a decent selection. Meal was also pretty good. To be honest though I could not sleep and highly suggest that Malaysia Airlines fly A330s on this route because you dont want be on a 737 for 6hrs.
Customer Service is nearly not existing. A WhatsApp number is provided but the wait to be served can be hours. When you receive a reply if you dont respond within the minute your request is closed and you have to do all other again. So nearly impossible to get through the system. Similar experience on the phone. When you do get through including by raising an official complaint on the system you get told it is resolved but when checking it is not. And the loop starts again. This is the main issue Im facing. But overall food quality is below average plans are not very clean and prices are therefore high for what you get. Im now waiting for over an hour at the head office only customer service center waiting to get served for over 1 hour.
My partner is a student and were in the process of moving her home we called to add her student KrisFlyer account to her ticket and they confirmed over the phone they did and that they left a note and that they unfortunately couldnt send email confirmation despite our requests. The ground crew were asking for email confirmation and attempted to charge us 600 euros for the extra weight 60kg despite our allowance supposedly covering this. Then the ground crew advised us to pay now and attempt to claim later which in a previous experience which costed me 2000 didnt get me any return We turned up 4 hours before our flight. Its been 2 while being on hold again for another hour to get reconfirmation. If you value you your time more than this avoid them if you can precovid Singapore was best in class. Now theyve begun to nosedive.
Muscat Abu Dhabi London. Delayed over two hours no vouchers offered. No welcome drinks or papers offered on the ground both sectors. Not all screens opened for the front row to watch the safety video. No cabin checks done on one side ex Abu Dhabi. Menus left on the seat arms in the middle of the night. Crew did not seem to have any supervision or experience.
Ahmedabad to New York via Doha. Qatar Airways was the best choice especially during long trip like 13 to 14 hours. Cabin crew very polite responding and engaging. Food was outstanding. Seats are pretty comfortable and wide enough to stretch your legs. It is the best airline among other airlines I travelled in. I would definitely fly with Qatar airways again.
Shorthaul international leg from Bangkok DMK to Singapore on the singleclass B737800. Even though its the first time writing a review for this airline I have flown with them no less than 10 times in the past prepandemic. Everything went along smoothly from the checkin counters 10 min wait to the boarding process and the entire flight itself. Everyone boarded on time took off on time and landed on time. Even though it is a budget airline it is a nice touch when they offer 20kg of checkin luggage at no additional cost as well as a small snack and bottle of water onboard. Legroom was aboveaverage for a budget carrier and good enough for most passengers under 6 feet. The crew were approachable and professional and made for a pleasant flight.
London Heathrow to Delhi return. I thought Air India was the worst until I traveled by British Airways via Premium Economy. Prices are not at all comparable thus I assumed they must be charging more for nicer services but not all. British Airways staff at Delhi Airport were rude and unprofessional. I have having plenty of weight limit left but even a few mm difference in cabin baggage they did not allowed as it was little hard to put in measuring case because of handle. Another small camera pouch they consider as a separate bag. I was forced to give my cabin bag to my father in law and left with a normal handy bag with all stuff in it. Coming to the aircraft food and staff equally poor. Food was horrific seats were torn headphone socket not working food tray was broken I was forced to keep serving tray on broken food tray giving support by thighs tv screen was not at all visible because of too many scratches. Staff was not able to help at all. Nightmare experience.
Manchester to Sharm el Sheikh return with Monarch Airlines. Plane clean and tidy on both routes plenty of legroom at front in extra legroom part which is where and why we fly with Monarch. Snacks range could do with expanding and MPLAYER seems absent on every plane we go on Usual comment about Egypt being classed as short haul therefore no entertainment but doubt it will change. But as a flight to a destination we like Monarch as they do what they say on the tin.
Booked over 9 months in advance and opted for comfortflex fare which included baggage onboard wifi access and upfront seat selection. We chose seats right at the front of the economy cabin at time of booking allowing party to sit together we were all on same booking. Aircraft was advertised as a new A321NEO with free wifi. However after checking in online aircraft had changed and subsequently seats were changed splitting up the party. Flight itself was comfortable with decent leg room and free fooddrinks though quality was lacklustre. Crew were absent in any form of engagement on board appearing distant.
Shanghai to Melbourne. MU737 on 19th April 2019. Total chaos at checkin. Ground staff was not able to manage the queues. Arrived at checkin gate 2.5 hours prior to departure almost missed the flight
Mauritius to London Heathrow with Air Mauritius. Efficient check in once computer problems solved. Flight ok seat uncomfortable as with all economy class. No regular water supply despite dehydration risk. Very good overall will definitely use again with knowledge gained. Much much better than BA. Like the service like the staff need to expand film choices out and back. Music could be better.
San Francisco to Paris with XL Airways France. I was really concerned after reading all the negative reviews and was pleasantly surprised to have a good experience. There were 3 of us and the money savings was a lot. Since we saved so much I upgraded our seats to more legroom very reasonably priced. On the way back we were able to get an emergency row for the 3 of us 50 each. The service going and coming back was really good. We had a meal snacks coffee tea and water free. Of course there was other stuff for sale like on all flights. Legroom in general is not that different from most of the major US airlines seat width is pretty narrow. The video entertainment is bad but they do rent tablets with videos games and documentaries for 10.00 well worth it. Even with all the extras it was still a big savings. The worst part of XL is their online booking. Its easy to book your tickets but if you have any questions forget getting hold of someone. Reserving your seats only if your lucky. I was able to book our seats about 3 weeks before our trip from SFO to Paris but not return. When we went to the airport to check in I asked about getting return seats they said ask in Paris they couldnt. Paris said you cant reserve seats until day of flight. We got to the airport about 2.5 hours prior to flight and easily reserved our seats. On our departure flight I noticed a lot of people angry about an extra charge for overweight luggage. Its shown everywhere what the weight limit is so we didnt have any issues. The weight limit is very reasonable 44lbs for a check in bag no charge and 5kg which is about 11lbs for carry on. If youve got the money to spend at least 400 and more for each ticket for an airlines with more frills go for it but I think you would have to pay at least 600 more to really feel the difference. WAITING FOR TICKET
Very disappointing service from SIA. Plane was dirty departing SIN and staff communication was poor. Staff were curt to the point of thinly veiled rudeness. Lots of room for improvement here.
A short haul from Gatwick to Rome and I had no expectations. Check in was quick and we were on a vintage Boeing 737. All in all very happy. They supplied a decent enough snack. Drinks service was efficient. There was no in flight entertainment available but we should all be able to cope for 2 hours without surely Comfortable enough friendly service got there on time and good price. All adds up to a happy traveller.
Unpleasant checkin experience which really spoiled the overall experience more than anything else. First of all online checkin failed repeatedly and no help was forthcoming from the email address that the airlines website FAQs directed questions on online check in errors to. To this day I have never received a response to my email. Their online checkin system seems to be fundamentally broken since resumption of operations post covid. Therefore I went early to the airport 3 hours ahead of the scheduled flight time for manual checkin but found a long poorlymanaged queue. The ground staff to whom Royal Brunei have subcontracted ground operations at Heathrow Terminal 4 were surly and disinterested. The particular lady who handled our check in was rude asked the same question 3 times because she wasnt paying attention to our answers or to her job and was instead casually complaining to her colleague about not wanting to work overtime right in front of us rather than just getting on with the task at hand. Its very unprofessional to discuss work gripes in front of customers whom one is supposed to be attending to at that moment. Priority boarding for Reserved seating was honoured though you have to listen carefully for the rushed announcements or youll miss the very short window given for priority boarding. Additional leg space for the Reserved seating was good making the journey more comfortable. The flight took off almost two hours late though the exact reason for this wasnt made clear to passengers and we had to wait on board during the delay. Cabin crew were very polite and helpful though overall the standard of service on Royal Brunei has declined compared to a decade ago. e.g. no amenity kits were provided for this flight and only one meal was served on a seven and a half hour flight LHR to DXB. It was tasty but the portion size was on the small side. Free snacks were available at the rear galley for those who went to get them but the cabin crew almost never came round with drinks except once with the meal service. However they did always respond attentively to calls and were friendly and efficient. The condition of the aircraft is very good. Complimentary toothbrushes were provided in the washrooms. Blankets and pillows provided for all seats. The entertainment system had a wide variety of options though some were quite obscure and the system is not easy to navigate or search through. Headphones were not distributed from London and I had to ask for them. They didnt actually carry enough headphones for all passengers on this flight which is shocking. Quality of the sound from the airlinesupplied headphones was poor.
Paris to Madrid. This airline has the smallest space between seats I cant even open a notebook to work during the flight. I avoid this airline just because of that their competitors lowbudgets have more space. So if you fly for business and you hope to work during the flight then choose any other airline.
I have flown with Jazeera many times. The seats are comfortable and staff usually polite. I have not had problems with an delays except once on a BahrainKuwait flight 1 hour. Flight prices are good value for money if booked early. Prices for fooddrink on board are acceptable.
PEKFNJ New TU204 seats relatively comfortable service friendly meal standard economy meal. Pyongyang Times and Korea Today newspapers which keep firsttime DPRK visitor busy for the flight.
Probably the worst flight I ever had with EK since I started flying with them 13 years ago. My route was DXBCAI and return both ways were with very old outdated B777. First of all EK stopped handing hot towels prior to take off inflight magazines are removed from the seat pocket probably to reduce cost. On the way DXBCAI we boarded on time however there was a delay of 1 full hour sitting on board with no explanation. Crew didnt even bother to serve water or a juice and no explanation from the captain secondly my headphones were not working properly due to the age of the aircraft and I had to keep holding it. Seat was broken and always reclining however I informed the crew but nothing happened they kept asking me to adjust my seat to up position and I kept telling them it was broken. On the way back it was the opposite it wouldnt recline at all. The food service also has dropped a lot with the quality of the meal service and the portions which have become similar to what you get on a Low cost. When arrived back to Dubai also 30 mins late the luggage was delayed for more than an hour they announced on the speakers but no explanation which led to being late for my early morning meeting as was supposed to land at 710am and had meeting at 930 am but I had to cancel it and of course no explanation or visibility of EK staff. Im seriously trying to avoid using them as much as possible now. Very disappointed with what they have became.
Our British Airways flight from Helsinki to London had issues with its brakes so the departure was delaytd. Original departure time was at 17.15 there were next info at 18.30 19.00 19.30 and 20.45. The captain gave us an announcement of situation at the gate around at 19.00. Meal vouchers were give at 20.00 for those who were still at the gate. Then after 21.00 an announcement to get luggage and hotel vouchers from the arrival hall. Next information will be given next morning at 09.00 which later was postponed until 14.30. Requests of rebookings were refused as the flight were not cancelled. They just said come to the airport early enough. British Airways failed to provide information about EU passangers rights as it had to be requested separately. Lot of fellow passsengers were not aware of their rights. Next afternoon local grond handling company only had regular number of checkin desks open even there were two flights chekingin at the same time. So only three desks open and they were not able to start checking us in but requesting us to step aside for the same day flight passengers. Great as we had only been waiting around 22hrs for our flights. Finally our flight got new departure time which was at 17.30 later to changed 18.00. At the gate departure time came and went and no announcement were made. Departure time were postponed until 18.30 with no announcement of reason for new delay. When requesting some futher information it was said its the same reason as yesterday but we had been given a written statement saying this aircraft had been fixed. At 18.30 still no announcement and passengers get anxious about mimimal information given by aviator. Then 20 min later British Airways cancels this flight. Now rebookings promised by next morning or then have to contact British Airways directly. Another hotel night at the airport hotel and we already knew how the procedure goes. Next day rebooked for Finnair flight to London and arriving London 45 hrs late and reaching the final destination about 46hrs late. The only positive aspect was cockpit and cabin crew effort to provide some information at the gate area at the beginning of whole ordeal.
I have not flown with Iberia yet so I cant speak for the cabin experience but had a horrible experience with their customer service agents. Calling them incompetent is an understatement. I have been hung up on even while I was still speaking more than three times. It took over an hour each with three different agents including being disconnected while speaking and being on hold so totalling over three hours for a simple date change request and they couldnt even get that done. I made a reservation on 63 online and called to request a date change since it couldnt be done online. As stated prior it took me more than three hours with three different agents to get it done at least I thought it was done. However when I called to request an updated eticket I was told that the date change hasnt been made so I had to go through another several hours to get that done and received an updated email with reissued eticket. But when I called them last November they told me all my reservations have been cancelled and I had to choose a new date withouth even an explanation on why it was cancelled in the first place. I have written to Iberias customer relations for a resolution and they simply responded two weeks later that it had been forwarded to the respective department. Now its January and I havent heard anything from Iberia. Dont think about getting any assistance or help from their customer service call center because you wont get any.
Our three children have travelled from Dar es Salaam to Houston via Doha by Qatar Airways Special Services. Unaccompanied minor. After hugs and kisses they told us that No more travelling with parents we will always travel with Qatar Airways special services you allow us to go.We have been treated like kings and queens. As parents hearing from your children that some else gave them a special care I felt obliged to let this known to other parents other people and to be honest and thankful for what they have done. I have never done a review before of anything. I always dont like to do it. I have been touched Im thankful you have worn our hearts.
Johannesburg to Windhoek return. Checked in at terminal B domestic British Airways SA however the flight departs from Terminal A which is about a 10 minute walk away security was okay immigration a little slow. These flights are operated by Comair but marketed as a British Airways franchise service. Used the Slow lounge which is very good with a good food drink selection coffee bar and food to order if required.. Boarding from A25 on to a bus. Aircraft a pretty old 737400 but clean and tidy seat 2A offers lots of space a similar lay out to BA European flights.. Departed on time once in the air service from a nice crew was very good food drinks pretty good. I was the only pax in business class so very nice experience. Arrival on time however the dreadfully slow immigration at WDH lasted 2 hours with a huge que from 3 arriving flights. Return check in was polite and quick however security immigration was rude and an absolute shambles Not the airlines fault. Used the local lounge which was quiet but offered nothing. No wifi either. Boarded the aircraft from gate 2 a short walk to the steps. Departed around 30 minutes late again an old but well kept 737400 seat 1A offered enough space for this 2hr flight. A full cabin this time but great service and good food offering. Pretty relaxing flight.
In June I flew in first from Los Angeles to Manila return via Singapore. Everything was top notch. Cabin crew are delightfully interactive and helpful. The flat bed seats are so wide. The entertainment screen is large. The selection of films is marvelous. The food is scrumptuous. The Lalique branded amenity kit and sleepwear are divine. The first class Star Alliance lounge in LAX is quiet private and offers a menu to order from. The Private Room within the first class lounge at Singapore Changi Airport feels so exclusive and also offers a great food menu.
Dubai to Cairo. Long queue at boarding desk but checking was smooththey had allotted our seat a day before journey and send the web boarding on mail they had given us aisle and next to aisle. The aircraft seating configuration was 242 we wanted to change to window but as no window were available for 2 to seat together. But when we boarded found that no one was seating beside us means we 2 share 4 seats that was comfortable. Flight departed and and arrived on time aircraft was clean good leg room breakfast was good we selected for special hindu meal and it was provided. No alcoholic beverage on Egyptair. Good in flight service. Overall good experience and can fly again.
Melbourne to Singapore. The check in experience is the worst. I request for aisle seat and I got the window seat. I cancel my Russia Holiday with Singapore Airlines they refused give me refund.
Everything about this trip went like clockwork. The fare was only slightly more than coach with a checked bag. We arrived in SFO to be immediately checked in by a counter agent. We had a pet traveling in the cabin with us and there were no issues. It took only a couple of minutes. When we got to PreCheck security line there were only a couple of people ahead of us. After going through security we headed to the Alaska Air Lounge. The lounge was not that crowded large and spotless. There were plenty choices of food on offer including an automatic pancake machine. At the gate we were promptly boarded and greeted by the agent by our first names. The plane was a typical EM175 and the seats were very comfortable. Left on time and service was great including the protein plate. We were able to see the larger peaks such as Shasta Hood and Reiner. Landing at Everett was interested with all the Boeing wide bodies waiting to be painted. Deplaning was quick and picked up our bags in a couple of minutes. Could not have asked for better service
London to Manila via Brunei. Very good and comfortable airline. So much leg room in the plane. Food was amazing and cabin crew were very polite. Cheap ticket. Would definitely fly with Royal Brunei Airlines again. They dont serve alcohol during the flight though and no smoking area at Brunei airport which is a downside but wont hinder me from flying with them again.
Unexpected disappointment. After having wrote numerous favorable reviews to ANA I have an unpleasant surprise that might be due to yearend excess of passengers. Service was the opposite of what it used to be on transpacific flight. Lounge at HND was overcrowded wifi slow no seats available wines out of stock etc. Business class passengers were boarded as cattle as we were very rudely urged to hurry up. No FA at the plane door We entered aircraft and seated without any welcome or support. Food started was served 90 mins after taking off and as it was after midnight we were informed that no dinner would be available just snacks. Drinks were rare. Later on no one helped me to put mattress. I hope this flight was just an accident.
Reached 3 hours prior to departure time. Took more than 45 minutes for baggage check in due to less staff at the check in counters Even after repeated feedback nothing was done Disappointed
Athens to Mykonos. Our flight was delayed for 5 hours before we were able to board only to try to take off on a plane that the pilot had to land back down. They promised us a flight to Mykonos from Athens that night so we waited for seven hours before they decided to cancel the flight at 1am in the morning. They did not provide hotel accommodation nor compensation for the hotel we booked at Mykonos that we cannot get a refund on. We had to sleep in the airport waiting for the next flight at 5am to make to Mykonos to catch our flight back home. We booked with another airline because they didnt have any flights til much later the next day. They promised us hotel compensation for our loss n time but it was all lies. I emailed the company several times with the info they told us to contact them for the compensation and have not heard one single word back.
First we were rebooked for no known reason through a different country to get home so the travel time was going to be longer but that isnt the worst that happened. The bigger problem was that coming back from our wedding my husband was asked if he could give up his extra seat as Copa was overbooked. He told them no because that is a comfort necessity for him. After that conversation my husband started looking for other flights that we could take because he felt bad for the gate agent who was visibly distressed and he found flights that would work to get us back home earlier and to a better airport. He went to the gate agent with that information and she was ecstatic that they could get a few more people on the flight while accommodating us. The original flight took off and then they informed us they were unable to get us on the other flights as expected. We were told that we would have a night in Miami on Copa so we accepted that not that we had any other choice at that point. When we got to Miami there was no one there to take us to a hotel as had been promised. After calling we were told that all agents were gone for the day so we would have to submit a complaint to get reimbursed so here we are If you say you will do something make sure it happens.
Kayseri to Istanbul. Good flight even if with little delay. Boarding procedures are slow and chaotic due to the size and organization of the departure airport. Fast and orderly landing procedures despite being a plane with many passengers and the flight was full. Recent aircraft 4 years. Comfortable seats last generation that save space with excellent space between the rows. IFE absent aircraft not prepared and probably used for internal flights with high attendance or on short routes. It was not active even though the IFE option on your device. Good food and drink given the type of flight it was just a sandwich hot and tasty. Friendly and hyper attentive staff. Excellent value for money.
London to Tokyo via Hong Kong. We booked our holiday with separate flights 16 days ago for 7 months time. Unfortunately due to the coronavirus our cruise around Japan and China was cancelled by our cruise company. Eventually after persisting for just under an hour we got through to a very unhelpful representative who told us that it was company policy to charge 300 each to cancel our booking. We tried to explain that the cancellation was not in our control but all they could say was company policy.
It was a round trip with Emirates from Delhi to Dubai and antagonistic experience in both journeys. Ground staff at Dubai was very rude and unhelpful whereas in India the check in was way easier despite of huge rush. We were stuck and struggling for self check in which we were guided again and again by the limited staff available and finally after half an hour when our check in baggage got stuck on the belt and we again have to helplessly ask for help for which the lady at the counter replied us to wait for 23 minutes. After 10 minutes when nobody turned up my husband reminded the same lady at the counter that we need help to which she replied I am on some other report and we should proceed towards manual counter. We were shocked My husband reminded her that our baggage is stuck to which she responded with irritation and called some technical staff to provide our baggage. Then we proceeded towards manual counter where again with technical glitches our check in was done in half an hour when all our documents were properly in place. In short more than an hour to check in at Dubai airport with Emirates without rush whereas in India within an hour we were done with check in security and immigration My suggestion to the passengers travelling from Emirates please dont expect soft spoken and helpful staff specially at Dubai airport and have spare time in hand to bear with the glitches.
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore with Jetstar Asia. Absolutely terrible in terms of consistency. Also encountered a one hour delay flying from Singapore to Malaysia. If you value your time please fly with another airline as two out of two times I encountered a one hour plus delay. They really need to step up their game. Whether your flight is delayed is just a coin flip.
Overall experience on Asiana was not great. The attentiveness and friendliness of the flight attendants and crew was the real positive. The plane was old business class seats were uncomfortable and too short. Food was just ok. The flight itself was one of the bumpiest Ive been on.
Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia is an airline that grows on me. Was not expecting twin aisle wide body jet but the aircraft couldnt have been more than a couple of years old flying from Stockholm to Gran Canaria. All seats had seat back AVOD. Films and TV were SEK 50 which seemed good value. I opted for the free music about 20 channels and also charged my phone through the USB port. Food was better than average and there seemed to be plenty of it. Drinks about SEK 35 for a Heineken and SEK 25 for a Coke. Beware seat recline button is hidden near the seat bottom. Would recommend.
London to Paris. Check in was awful 1 or 2 of our bags were overweight and we had 3 bags in total. We said that since it would be logical to still allow it since the total baggage weight would still equal to less than 4 bags at first the supervisor refused but then after some convincing he put our bags on but refused to print boarding passes luckily I had them on my Wallet app. I reached out to social media about this they apologized and later got 3 50 Delta Choice Selection as an apology. We boarded in a 7879 which is very young and the cabin staff were much better there was IFE on this 35 Minute flight. Once airborne they served a pack of 2 Cookies and drinks too after that we landed. WIFI is available but you have to pay for it.
At 7.54 am on the day of travel whilst driving to London Heathrow I received an email advising my flight had been cancelled. I was offered an alternative flight with American Airlines which I had no alternative but to accept as I must travel today. I was flying to LA to see a family member who is end of life. The American Airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economy. Tried 3 times BA provide telephone number total useless no help given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the email. I have been a BA frequent flyer for decades and have been a loyal customer. I now find I am travelling 11 hours in Economy without even the possibility of a refund let alone an upgrade. This is completely unacceptable. What has happened to this company I have had better treatment from Ryanair.
I flew from London Gatwick to Brisbane via Dubai returning via Singapore and Dubai. My flight from Gatwick to DXB was extremely pleasant entertainment was great the A380 was excellent. Food was great as well I cleared all the meals. The disappointing part of the journey were the cabin crew they just didnt seem available and welcoming. They just seemed to be very tired and were too much involved and busy in chatting among themselves. Overall this leg was great apart from the cabin crew. DXB to BNE was even worse in that field the flight was already very long which was stressful enough. I had a massive headache and when I consulted one member of the cabin crew she was a supervisor she just told me to go back to my seat and watch movies as they offered lots of choice. And that annoyed me I thought cabin crew were supposed to be of support during a flight. The return flights from BNE to SIN SIN to DXB were excellent and even the crew were excellent and seemed professional and friendly. No comment on the DXB to LGW flight as it was well packed so the cabin crew were busy other than that I slept the whole flight so cant say much.
I was traveling to Vancouver with my family for the first time and since we were traveling with a baby I paid for two luggages. We were smart enough to put an Air Tag inside my babys luggage. When we arrived at the Vancouver airport the tag showed that one luggage was still in Toronto. There were no one from Flair Airlines at the baggage claim to answer the questions about delayed luggages. We had to go to the departure lounge to find someone to talk to. They filled out a form and promised they will get the luggage by the end of the night which meant the next flight. We kept checking the location of the Air Tag and it wasnt shipped with the next flight. Finally the next morning the tag showed it was in Vancouver. No one had contacted us about the arrival of the luggage. We went to the airport to pick it up. We asked to talk to a supervisor on duty and the personnel laughed at us meaning they dont have any supervisors They couldnt find the luggage in their storage room and claimed it didnt arrive while we showed it to them that the tag shows its in Vancouver The lady was trying to convince me that the luggage is lost or something while I had no more formula and clothes for my three month old baby. When she realized she cant fool us with her story she started crying. It was at that time she called her supervisor and asked for the luggage while crying. 10 minutes later there was another person walking around with our luggage. The luggage they claimed that didnt arrive. The luggage had minor damage but my baby was hungry so I didnt have time to fight over that. We stayed in Vancouver for two days and one day was wasted in the airport fighting over the luggage. Worst experience ever Not flying anywhere else with this airline anymore. Rude personnel and irresponsible management. The staff kept saying we always have this issue with Toronto flight.
Air Canada cancelled our flight two hours before it was supposed to leave. No one helped us or cared. We ended up on the phone with Air Canada Im the airport trying to rebook for over an hour and they were not able to find us a different flight. As a result our entire family trip to Disneyland had to be canceled. Crying kids and adults absolute devastation and Air Canada did nothing.
HELMUC on tired MD 87. Took the Internet upgrade opportunity for 4900 to Premium Economy. Worth it on ground service Quick checkin Fast Track at Security as Economy Pax had a long queue for both. The SAS Lounge in Helsinki very basic. Cabin crew friendly nice breakfast. However no English newspapers available and no comments at all to the flight from the cockpit The price for the upgrade is ok as I had 2 rows for me alone in contrary to the Economy cabin which was 95 full. Otherwise you are flying Low Cost with a high economy fare.
Went with Germanwings from Manchester to Cologne 21st October returned 28th October first time with this airline very satisfied and would definitely recommend to friends flights on time and staff very helpful.
We booked a flight from Phuket to Istanbul with Salam Air with our final destination being Antalya Turkey. Unfortunately our journey was marred by significant disruptions. Firstly our flight was delayed by four hours causing inconvenience and disruption to our travel plans. Regrettably after a twohour delay the flight was abruptly canceled leaving us stranded. We immediately contacted Salam Airs customer support for assistance. However the representative provided us with false information and failed to offer a suitable solution. She wrongly informed us that the next available flight was fully booked leading us to cancel our entire reservation. It was later discovered that this information was incorrect as seats were indeed available on the following weeks flight. This miscommunication resulted in unnecessary financial losses and prolonged our ordeal. After the cancellation we were informed that our original flight had been refunded leaving us with the only option of booking a new flight at a significantly higher cost. Despite our persistent efforts to communicate with Salam Airs customer care they displayed a concerning lack of responsiveness. It took an excessively long time approximately one and a half months for them to respond to our refund request. Upon review they claimed that the new ticket did not match their original booking final destination adding further frustration and a lack of resolution to our already unpleasant experience. We have exhausted all channels of communication with Salam Air and they have failed to address our concerns or provide an adequate resolution.
I would like to thank Sandeep and his team who were so polite and were really helpful throughout the flight. Sandeep also offered me a tea for which he did not charge anything even after i tried paying it. The team was so polite and helped him each time. I Thank you for making my this journey so amazing.
The return journey from HKG to BKK reaffirmed the low quality of the airline that I experienced on the outward journey. Added to that however was the 50 minutes to queue in the Online Checkin having arrived at the airport more than the recommended 3 hours before flight departure. This is presumably as a result of only 2 checkin counters open for Online checkin. 2 were available for those who had not checked in and these seemed to move more quickly. Once through and with enough time to grab a bite at the airport the greeting on board was initially friendly but then the surly attitude of any staff with whom I came into any brief contact one who removed my light hand luggage with laptop to accommodate a passenger at the Emergency Exit whos steamer trunk hand luggage could not fit into the overhead luggage bin above his seat which Emirates call hat rack if only. I had heard Emirates were the best on offer in this post pandemic era but if that is the case the standard must be extremely low. So low a lowcost airline would make more sense. As I had eaten before departure I was able to avoid the food service and had brought a bottle of water with me so I did not have to endure the chaotic and illogical FB service with its dire offerings.
Flew SYDSINSYD and all in all cant complain. Service was excellent food excellent large wine choice. Seats werent much different to other Business class seats we have experienced although I would suggest that couples dont choose window seats as they need to actually stand up and walk around to speak to their partner. Seats in centre are adjoining with a sliding screen between. Qantas first class lounge in Sydney was fantastic with full restaurant service. Singapore lounge very comfortable with plenty of seats. Would definitely fly BA again.
My luggage was damaged during the flight and one of the wheels came off. At HKG airport we reported the damage and were offered a new luggage of the same size. Waited almost an hour to see a smaller one brought over. They then asked me to wait for another 20 min so they bring a bigger one over. Our trip started out nicely with business class all the way from Toronto to Hong Kong via Taipei but ended quite disappointingly with luggage damage and a wait time.
Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur. No inflight entertainment. Seats are rock hard and sit too upright. Absolutely freezing so make sure you bring a coat as they charge you for a blanket. They entice you into a flight with great prices to realise they charge extra for everything a full service airline give you as standard.
Brussels to Casablanca. I had to pay extra 50 euros at airport for having just 2 kilos more. I am very disappointed. My ticket cost me 200 euros at the start now cost me 250. Totally ridiculous At the end had to wait 1 hour at arrival the get back my luggage.
LHR to VIE BA 704 23 June 2014. The meal service in Euro Traveller is appalling as are the customer service standards of the New Mixed Fleet Crew The food offering was inedible a choice of Flat Bread with Chicken Tikka or a Salad. Do British Airways not understand that not everyone likes Curry or spicy food. At least do an offering of Meat or Cheese Sandwiches to make the selection a little better in consideration of the fares passengers have paid. As for the cabin crew this new Mixed Fleet with their Thunderbird Hats are very inferior compared to the cabin crew on the old contracts. At least experienced cabin crew would sort something out in the galley to at least compensate for the lack of food choice even if it is cheese and crackers. This crew do not offer anything and were nowhere to be seen once they did their meal service. I would have expected for a two hour flight they would at least walk through the cabin a few times offering more drinks etc the only time they came out was to clear away the meals which many people around me had left and not touched and to do the Duty Free. I fly British Airways every week and this is the worst crew I have known. I think the Mixed Fleet Crew are appalling in their customer service standards they can certainly learn a lot from their more experiences colleagues who are on the old contracts so come on BA start to bring back the high standards again the new Mixed Fleet Crew are letting you down very badly.
I was a big fan of Cathay before had flew them preCovid all the time. Was a good airline. But now it was somehow a terrible experience. The seats are good Im short so the legroom is good. Nothing much to say but the cleanliness is a bit unacceptable. I had a need to do gaming through the flight. I successfully ran through the game through the inflight WiFi so I will give them 4 stars. The food wasnt terrible compared to others reviews. However the ground service or the flight time slot itself is unacceptable.
Ghastly describes the British Airways experience in a single word. The new Club Europe seats are not fit for purpose at all when it comes to a 4 hour flight. Its impossible to stretch out because there is no space and I am only 6 foot tall. Its impossible to work because there is insufficient space and its impossible to relax but the new seats barely recline. This is by no stretch of the imagination a quality airline product. For anyone prepared to pay a premium do yourself a favour and give your money to another airline.
All went perfectly until transfer at Cairo. Connecting flight left us behind because Egyptair was an hour late leaving Heathrow. From therein it was total chaos and arrived Entebbe 8 hours late after hellish experience not made any easier by the unhelpful Egyptair attitude to customer service. They literally do not care at ALL whether they fail and let down their customers.
Flew British Airways from Los Angeles to Amsterdam via London Heathrow rt in Club World. Actually prefer the B777 over the A380 which was surprising. We used the Qantas FC lounge in LAX and Galleries First at Heathrow. Both were great. Service on board all flights top notch and friendly. Food and drinks good even if the steak was a bit on the well done side. Like that you can preselect meals out of LHR. Wish you could do this out of LAX as well. My complaint is Club Europe legroom. I know they block out the middle seat but at 62 the legroom is tight. All in all great value for the money. We picked up three trips on BA during their Business Class sale last year. Next in FCO and then DUB.
Worst possible ground service I have experienced. The staff were rude and not aware of the many visa policy changes and insists on being right though proven otherwise through official government channels. And flights not on time.
A week before departure I was notified that the flight was cancelled. I had the option to fly the following day or to get a refund. I took the first option which meant staying and paying for an extra night in Dublin and loosing a night in Chisinau. The flight itself is three and a half hours. The seats were cramped but no worse than any other low fare carrier in the European market. On the FlyOne website they state In addition to the free of charge onboard catering a wide range of double sandwiches hot and cold drinks offered on all FLYONE flights we are glad to offer our Meal PreOrder service. There was no complimentary catering the night I flew and no mention of why it had been curtailed. There was however a buy on board coffee and sandwich service that ran out of both coffee and sandwiches before they got to my row 26 so still quite far from the back. When I asked about the catering issues the staff just shrugged this issue off and sat in their galley chatting for the rest of the flight.
The first time I took my oneyear old baby on a long journey Oct 31 2020 BeijingToronto we met many difficulties. Fortunately the flight attendants of Hainan Airlines gave us a lot of help. They took care of me and my baby all the way and provided very considerate service. I was deeply moved by their warm patient behavior. They watched over the babys various needs along the way and played with him when he was upset and crying. Here I would like to express my special thanks to the HU7975 crew of Hainan Airlines who gave us a perfect and impressive travel.
Going from Auckland I was on premium economy no complaints about that every thing was very good. On my return I was sitting in economy and I was hoping will be very good service specially when you fly long haul flight but everything is was opposite. Food very ordinary after serving special food al most after 30 minutes later they come with drinks. We have received 2 meals so in my first meal I ate my food couldnt wait for drinks but in breakfast i though I wait for drinks then start my breakfast. By the time i have received the drinks including tea all my meals were cold. Secondly they are very slow in serving meals. The earphones are very cheap. Overall I was not expecting this from Air NZ. Hopefully they will read the review and try to maintain their quality of service in future.
Singapore to Shanghai on 28th July 2018 it was a lovely morning warm welcomed by the crews on board seemed like the flight was not full on that day. Had book the cook US beef and it was really amazing I could not agree more as it was the best beef I had before. Specially thanks to a lovely air stewardess her service was really on top. Cabin was spacious. Its a perfect option so far.
London City to Mykonos. I usually love BA Cityflyer from LCY really good airline nice planes and plenty of room. This trip we flew Club Europe to Mykonos a 3hour 45min flight. The service was atrocious. There is no BA lounge at LCY so really the only differentiation is the onboard product they should really make an effort. The crew spend most of the flight chatting in the galley. They eventually came out after 50 minutes and gave us a drink. Food was good but they did not provide icecream or desert as per the menu. The CSM dropped a salad at my feet tomato all up my legs and on my shoes without an apology. The remnants just sat there for the rest of the flight being trodden into the carpet. No tea and coffee was offered. No hot towels. In fact there was very little engagement with any passengers. This was not a bust flight there was no turbulence or other reason for a lack of service. It really did just appear that the crew could not be bothered. Such a shame when a business ticket on this flight costs nearly 300 one way On a positive note we flew back in economy and the service was far superior This may have just been a bad experience but come on BA you should be delivering what you advertise. I have complained but I guess it will fall on deaf ears.
When I first booked Transavia France I was very scared because of bad reviews I had read. To my surprise almost everything went very well. There was no problem with putting my 10kg luggage in a hold for free. Flight attendants were very nice. I had a lot of space for legs and my stuff my height is 161 cm my boyfriends height is 180 cm he could fit comfortably as well. The only inconvenience we had was a 45 minutes delay because we had to wait for a free slot to be able to takeoff. However the pilot managed to land quicker than planned so the delay was even shorter. In general I enjoyed my flight and I would decide to book Transavia France again.
TRZ to KUL via Chennai return. The aircraft was relatively clean on both sectors. Since this was the only flight to Trichy from Kuala Lumpur I thought it would be more practical to just take this flight since there is no hassle of getting out into Chennai. However the transit procedure in Chennai is terrible. We had to get on bus queue up till everyone got off the plane and go though security check again. For the price you pay the service is not at all worthwhile.
Kahului to Newark via San Francisco. My flight with Virgin America was very good It was originally supposed to leave Kahului at 110 p.m January 1 but it was changed to 1110 p.m January 1 a few months in advance. It was good that I was made aware of this a good few months before by trip. This meant I got to spend a couple extra hours in Kahului before heading back home to Newark. The flight to SFO was very good the captain was funny and made a few jokes and the flight attendants were friendly. We were able to make it to SFO in about 4 hours and 15 minutes instead of the scheduled 5 hours. This meant I could enjoy a nice breakfast at the airport before my second leg. The flight from SFO to EWR was just as good. There was a wide selection of drinks and snacks as well as movies. However the movies did have to be paid for but I didnt much mind as I had my kindle and 3DS. Cabin crew was also friendly. We did have to enter a hold when approaching Newark as their was bad weather and congestion in the air. But this was to be expected after all this is Newark and it happens all the time. We touched down at 5ish in the afternoon on January 2. Overall it was a very good experience.
Istanbul to Toronto with Turkish Airlines. The food is excellent. The cabin crew friendlier than many airlines Ive flown with. Never had any trouble and the flights are almost always on time. Love the direct flights to Canada. The economy class seats could be a little bit more comfortable but overall a happy customer.
Miami to Hong Kong via Istanbul. If you are a Vegetarian do not fly with Turkish Airlines. I order vegetarian special meal VOML for my mother when flying with me in advance. When we flight with Turkish Airlines they will serve her some food she cant touch from time to time such like eggs cheese cake with eggice cream. However the worse experience happened at the business class from IST to HKG TK070 flight. They served her a meatball as a starter So I told this FA We have a special meal but this apparently is a meatball that she cannot touch. This FA then replied me I know you have a special mealbut this is just a starter we always serve meals one by one. I asked him a question If you are a Muslim and order a Muslim mean how will you feel if you are served a pork as a starter I cant believe what he said the next moment. I am OK with that After hearing this answers I was so furious and done talking with him then asked him to remove this meatball from my mothers table. This is the first time I was so angry at a cabin crew. After this terrible experience I left a feedback at TK website. Their reply special meal requests can be added for the main course only. Since we cannot provide this service for starters they may include some milk products or meat So they really dont care if their guests will get sick but still serving these bad foods for them. This is definitely the worse and most ridiculous airline I have even seen.
The flight from Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur was delayed because of luggage being topped up from connecting flight. Once I arrived in Kuala Lumpur i was running so fast to catch my next flight going to Manila. But when I arrived in Manila yesterday my luggage are not there. Staff told me my luggage was left in Kuala Lumpur not to cause delay in the flight. They are proud of hospitality where is this value I cannot seem to feel it now where you cause me more stress.
Prague to Barcelona. I bought the ticket via CSA web and operated by CSA was promised. In the end came the plane from their coowning company SmartwingsTravel Service which is a low cost airline. This is now turning to be very regular what CSA do. This plane was old ugly and dirty with low cost distances between the seats hitting the knees and I am really not a giraffe. Horrible service and the food which I ordered and paid in advance was also very bad. I used to fly CSA in the past but since Travel Service took off I try to avoid it. You pay national airline price but you get very bad low cost service.
Perth to Munich via Doha. Perth to Doha Boarding was reasonably fast for a packed large plane. Seat pockets in economy are very tight everybtime the man behind me tried to fit something in the seat pocket I felt it. Food was tasty I had the beef harissa because this flight forgot my special meal request. However no premeal drink service meal service commenced 90 minutes after take off no cup holders as part of tray very tight seat pockets. Hard plastic cups used means no place to store used cups by the end of the flight multiple broken plastic cups were strewn around our seats. No inflight shopping magazine. Doha to Munich Bus to flight. 777. Decent seat pockets. Inflight shopping magazine available. My special meal was remembered Free wifi was available for an hour. Entertainment range is the same as the previous flight and even though the system is clearly older it worked just as well. Good flight pity this was for the shorter connecting flight.
My flight was originally on Delta from Salt Lake City to Madrid for both business and pleasure. Due to Delta leaving 3.5 hours late I missed my connection in Paris and as all the Delta Partner flights were booked going down to Madrid that evening they put me on an Iberia flight. This gave me a 4 hour layover or so in Paris so you would think my luggage would have arrived. It didnt. I figured it would show up a day or so later because how do you lose luggage for longer than that and I made the mistake of only making only one pair of underclothes and two shirts in my backpack. As the days progressed with no luggage I was told by Iberia to hold onto my receipts for reimbursement as I had to by clothes I could wear for my conference makeup and some clothes for the vacation portion of my trip. I didnt go wild. Finally on the 9th day of no luggage they contacted me to say it was found and now in Madrid. That didnt help as I was in Barcelona. I instructed them to send it to my home in Utah to which they told me they would send me the shipping information. They never did. Three days later there was a knock at my door at 450 a.m. that freaked me out because I wasnt expecting anyone. It ended up being my luggage. Luckily it was all there. Unfortunately the story doesnt end there. When the Iberia representative told me to hang onto my receipts he gave me an email address to send all my documentation. I did so knowing that reimbursement could take up to 30 days. After 3 weeks of radio silence from Iberia I contacted them to check the status and they said they never received my paperwork They gave me a new email address and I resubmitted again. This time I saw emails from them saying they were processing and I could expect a check in approximately 30 days. Fast forward to this week. At day 36 I called them and was told that they couldnt help me. That I would need to lodge a complaint through their website. I immediately did and received an email that said it could take up to 21 days to respond. When I got home that day there was a check in the mail for less than half of the amount submitted. Ive since contacted them without response. The customer service of this airline is unbelievably horrible As Iberia was the airline I last flew with when the luggage went missing according to airline regulations they are responsible for whatever happens to it.
Never make the mistake to fly this airline again. I flew them several times. Making changes with them is a very long process and even flight in the higher class they charge you money. When you want refunds they give you vouchers and it is absolutely impossible to change them or get that money back. I am frequent traveller of many airlines and I can tell for experience LATAM is at the bottom of efficiency and they are absolutely thieves.
Riyadh to Jeddah. It was Low Cost Carrier So had to pay for baggage and Snacks. Price of checkin baggage if bought at time of checkingin was as high as 100 SAR per baggage piece i.e 50 of total fare. Even upon request Wheelchair was not arranged. But some how ground handling staff arranged it from some other airline. Snacks Price were bit high during flight. Upon Landing at Jeddah there were no Jet bridges so I requested Ambulator Medical Lift which they clearly denied that they cannot call and Ambulator for me so had to use stairs to hop off the aircraft. In my personal Opinion it is a cruel act. Luckily I can walk with sticks but what about Passengers who are completely dependant upon wheel chair.
Overall as expected from a 4 star fullservice carrier. The luggage allowance of 30kg for discount economy flyers proved more generous than expected as my two pieces of baggage totalled up to about 32kgs yet the gate agent still didnt raise any issues or charge me any additional luggage fees. As expected the 777s within Etihads fleet are somewhat dated interior wise where since the particular aircraft first flight in 2012 after looking up its registration took its maiden flight it is most likely the interior has not been renovated since. This doesnt prevent the crew from still delivering on a somewhat pleasant 14 hour flight tho with 2 full meals and snacks in between. The only downside is the lack of a selfservice snack bar in the galley of the aircraft which made finding a quick bite or even trying to grab some water after sleeping particularly difficult. With all that in mind and considering the relatively affordable price point makes the flight still one worth recommending.
Yogyakarta to Ternate via Makassar with Sriwijaya Air. Both legs of the journey went smoothly. No significant delays comfortable seats and decent hot meals provided with a 15 kg free checkedin luggage allowance.
Great accommodation for economy class. Food was filling of quality ingredients presented well. My flight was made Comfortable with the flight essentials provided. Korean brand is visible from the staff to the planes design. Ill try to do the Free Culture Tour next time.
Very Smooth flight. Seat space is very comfortable for economy 81 cm much more than others offer. Good entertaining and nice crew. Free champagne and a nice dinner with several courses free wines and a pre landing snack. Only the snack was bad and only dry bread. Delay one hour but arrived on time. Would fly Air France again.
Kigali to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha both flights on time I sat in seat 2K on both flights B7878. Lounge access smoothly provided in KGL and DOH and they were both excellent. All Boarding Passes issued at CheckIn in Kigali. Online check in possible but constitute a nuisance as the BP issued are not respectedvalid in KGL. Flights from Central Africa are derouted from KGL to DOH which cost some 23 hours additional flight time due to flight ban over UAE. Predeparture drinks offered on both flights. Inflight entertainment was not working properly so had to change seat 1st flight. FA and service onboard good but food is poorer than before. E.g. no beef or fish are available. Lamb chops appeared to be some tough meat. Drinks are fine but sparsely loaded they ran out of 2 beer brands and remained with Heineken only. No icecream. DohaSaigon leg was a perfect flight the FAs were fantastic very proactive and truly caring. Food was much better on this leg as compared to the previous. Got a delicate cod as main dish. Morning breakfast was surprisingly good as well fish congee served with fresh chilli and soya sauce and fish sauce was available. Received pyjamas and amenity kits. Got loads of frequent flier miles which were updated on my Privilege Club account immediately after landing.
Unhelpful untrained checkin staff that does not know anything outside of the guide book. We were returning to Hong Kong where we live and have permanent residency from Paris. My husband does not have a HK passport and unfortunately his HKID card was stolen together with everything in his bag 4 hours before checkin. We just managed to get to the airport and file the case to the French police. As my husbands passport can enter HK visafree anyway we decided not to miss the flight. As we are at the checkin the checkin staff insisted on seeing either the HKID card or a visa despite the passport that my husband holds can enter Hong Kong visafree. We explained the situation to them understanding that it might be outside of their normal procedure providing extra information and asking if theres anything we can do. And all we get is a cold stare and they said but thats not our problem. After very unpleasant treatments and their internal clarifications they finally let us in. And when we arrived Hong Kong the immigration department let us in in less than 2 minutes. The cabin crew are on the otherhand friendly and helpful. But that was not much of a compensation for the horrible tasteless and not visually appealing food. In general I have had better experience with budget airlines than Finnair. Will not travel with them again and will not recommend to anyone.
I am still paying the price for my unforgettable mistake of booking flights LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo on March 22 2023 and LH717 from Tokyo to Frankfurt on April 17 2023. To start one of our bags was delayed for more than five 5 days and the airlines customer service at the Frankfurt Airport was unhelpful in resolving the issue. Despite spending over an hour discussing the problem we received no information about the status of our bags and they seemed indifferent to our inconvenience. Thankfully a service agent who overheard our conversation and helped us establishing the status of the missing bag. Furthermore Lufthansas reimbursement policy for the toiletries and clothing was unclear and unsatisfactory. We were informed after the fact via email that Lufthansa only refunds 100 of the toiletry items and 50 of the clothing we had to purchase in Frankfurt and at the airport before our departure to Japan. Although we filed the expense reports with corresponding copies of the receipts on April 27th we have been receiving daily emails stating that they cannot issue reimbursements due to the lack of receipts which were originally filed. This has been a frustrating experience and has resulted in repeated filings of the same receipts. During our return trip from Tokyo we were assigned a seat in the lower deck of the business class section which was broken making the 11hour and 40minute flight extremely uncomfortable. When we brought this to the attention of the head flight attendant she was apologetic but did not offer any solution other than the manual manipulation of the seat every time we needed to change its position. To our surprise two members of what we believe was an orchestra seated in the upper deck of the business class section with their cellos strapped into chairs next to them. Instead we had to manually manipulate the seat every time we needed to change positions. Although the flight attendants offered to compensate us for the damaged seat they changed their minds three times For the high price of a business class ticket I expected much better treatment and a more comfortable experience.
We were a family of 6 adults and one toddler we bought tickets that included a 7 economy tickets and paid for an upgrade to include b an upgrade to allow me to choose my seats ahead of time c a meal plan for each passenger and d checked luggage. Well the upgrades to the reservation we did not receive. Because I chose an a la carte airline I was encouraged to pay the added fee to preselect my seats. As a large party traveling with a toddler I added the upgrade to the reservation and added the meal plan for all seven tickets. Weeks before the trip I logged into the website confirmed our seats added our trusted travel documents and selected our mealsbeverages for the flight. When checkin opened 24hrs before takeoff our seats were different than what had been selected leaving the toddler to be seated on his own. We called the airlines Level and Iberia and were informed that there had been a system issue and while the seats appeared to be different online they were in reality as we had booked . When we approached the counter at JFK the attendants informed us that the seats we had booked were no longer availablehad been reserved for other passengers and we would not be able to occupy our reserved seats despite providing supporting documentation with the details of our original reservation and the letter from corporate confirming them. Once on board we did not receive the items included in our meal plan. Some passengers did not receive their food some did not receive their beverages. One passenger received all of his items at the end of the flight. When we asked the crew for our items we were told we had not prepaid or that they would have to look into it. These events were not isolated to one leg of the trip it repeated itself on our return trip though this time they blamed a plane change for the issues. Again we were told at the counter that we would not be able to occupy our seats b we had not prepaid c nothing could be done and d we did not receive our meals. The aforementioned events cannot even be blamed on a language barrier as I am native Spanish speaker.
Chicago to Zurich via London. Delays after delays. The flight was supposed to depart at 830 pm Chicago Time but was scheduled at 940 pm we waited a long time at the airport. Finally at 10 pm we managed to board on the A380 for my first time but the legroom was horrible. The IFE completely unfunctional and with no food served. During the taxi a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate. In the end the plane took off at 12 am Chicago time and we arrived in London Heathrow at 2 pm. We had to wait 3 hours for boarding for another 30 minutes delayed flight. We arrived in Zurich on an old A319 at 930 pm Zurich time instead of the original 330 pm. Very stressful at least the staff were nice.
Super impressed with the product. Excellent Business Class seats that go totally flat the crew were super attentive and catering was very good indeed.
What a mission it was to get hold of Airlink to change our tickets Due to testing positive for Covid our travelling plans had to change drastically. I held the line for Customer Service for 40 minutes until a rude lady picked up on the other end sighing with every question I had. Then came the public holiday so we couldnt make any name changes or add a minor by ourselves on the website. Luckily I got hold of a very friendly lady the next day to help add a minor but I still had to send an email for the name change. I phoned Customer Care on Friday at 1550 and by 1630 I got cut off. Still no reply to my email with the address given as the emergency contact. It is the weekend now and Customer Care is closed. How could this be With Covid we have learned that anything could change any minute what should a passenger do if they have to change their flight details Get on the flight even though they have Covid just because they couldnt change everything on the website and dont want to loose their money Come on Airlink you could do a lot better to assist passengers affected by Covid.
Doha to Kathmandu the flight departure timing was scheduled for 0305 and on the same day when we reached at airport we came to know that flight timing has been postponed to 1655 it means almost 14 hours delayed. We meet the staff of Nepal airlines and asked him for the solution. He suggests us to go back to the room or wait in airport waiting lounge. He also said that I will give you 35 riyal food voucher. How cheap is that After a long time discussion around 12 hours they are agreed to pay the taxi fare and advised us to return back to our own accommodation. As we dont have any option so we agreed and returned back to our own accommodation. On the same day at afternoon we came again in airport and everything was going smoothly. But again we faced the issue over luggage. As per the ticket it was mentioned 40kg luggage allowance. And again they were saying that they reduced the luggage allowance and now it is only 35kg allowable. Afterwards we paid 110QAR and proceed for immigration. On Board cabin crew behavior makes us totally disappointed. T I asked for water and they gave in small cup when I again asked for another glass of water then she says Please wait until I finish to serve others. Return From Kathmandu to Doha we faced the same issue while returning Our actual flight timing was for 1120PM but when I called to their representative 01 day before they informed us that flight is scheduled for 0800AM it means around 15 hours early. We went to their office and informed them that we cannot travel 15 hours early and requested them to provide the ticket after that timing. Again they started arguing with us. After 1 hour discussion they provided us connection flight Jet Airways via Mumbai. There was no any information regarding reschedule of flight and luggage allowance. I suggest that you do not travel with Nepal Airlines.
Punta Cana Gatwick. World Traveller Plus cabin on B777. I find this particular cabin very noisy possibly due to proximity of the engines. Seats are comfortable and leg room and elbow room significantly better than economy. The front row of World Traveller Pus has even more legroom but be warned that this is a mixed blessing since this row is fitted with shelves for strapping down babies cradles and if you sit next to a passenger who requires this facility then it will severely compromise your space. IFE was OK but nothing special. Main meal was OK but breakfast was an absolute disgrace a dry cheese croissant and a small granola bar. No alternatives offered. I know this is not business class but for the premium I paid for World Traveller Plus I feel entitled to something better than this really very poor take it or leave it excuse for a breakfast. The drinks service was nothing special either one round of juice or water before take off an offer of wine with dinner and another juice and water run after dinner. Then nothing until breakfast. Regarding the crew some were engaging and friendly but far too many others were offhand and unsmiling. When in all innocence I used a toilet in the Business Class cabin I found a member of cabin crew waiting for me when I emerged who promptly berated me for my mistake. Fair enough but when I explained that other passengers in World Traveller Plus had also used the toilets in Business Class I was virtually called a liar. I backed off from an argument but I found the experience upsetting and I simply couldnt get to sleep thereafter. I eventually disembarked at LGW hungry thirsty and a somewhat unhappy bunny. In summary World Traveller Plus is probably just about worth it for the extra comfort and space but dont get your expectations too high in terms of food and drink and be prepared for inconsistent inflight service.
We were booked on Air Transat flight TS178 from Montreal to Porto. The first leg was from Toronto to Montreal. Upon landing on the 15th of September at Montreal for our connecting flight a few hours later we were informed that it had been cancelled. I later found out through a friend that it was due to a technical issue with the A310 we were supposed to fly. We were rescheduled for departure on the 16th at 4 PM. Upon arrival we found out the plane was delayed again and that we would have to wait until 850 PM for departure. Transat never advised us it was HiFly just that it was an A340300 we would be flying. Wasnt hard to put two and two together however. Upon boarding the plane 1st class as we were booked on club I was pleased to see it was quite clean and the attendants were polite and friendly. The pilot was also very polite and was in the cabin speaking with the passengers before departure. Before takeoff we were advised that there would be some light to moderate turbulence a few hours into the flight which proved accurate as meal service was stopped but nothing that we werent prepared for. About an hour or so in they began dinner service. Selection was limited so we had the risotto. It was actually decent but the croissant was bit dry. The full recline of the seats was nice however I had to switch with my Fiancee as hers didnt work and Im too nervous a person to fully recline anyways. Still a comfortable enough seat and as it was a former Emirates first class cabin the space was incredible. The breakfast was far more fresh and quite good. Focaccia croissant and mixed fruit which were served about an hour before landing. Landing was so smooth you couldnt even feel the initial touchdown nor the front wheel touchdown. The A340300 is a nice smooth plane and our pilot made it that much smoother. All in all it was an excellent experience. Air Transat was very accommodating and HiFly filled in quite nicely.
Khartoum to Amsterdam via Istanbul. I was very disappointed with the airport service at Istanbul. The employee told me to go the transfer desk when arriving at Istanbul to get my boarding ticket for Amsterdam and when I went to the transfer desk an employee told me to go to the Denied boarding office because there werent any seats. I went to the Denied boarding office when it was the last call for my flight due to the excessive delay in the security control. The security control was packed with more than hundreds of people and some even climbed over the fences and it was very chaotic. Anyways when I went to the office the employee then told me that I missed my flight and asked why I came here. I explained everything to him but the only response I got was to go back to the transfer desk. Then when I went back to the transfer desk the other employee told me to go to the ticket sales desk. I was expecting them to arrange a seat in a flight today but when i went to the ticket sales desk the employee said that there were no remaining seats and booked me a seat in the next days flight and charged me 500 dollars when it was the airlines fault. The service was awful and the employees did not even know how to swiftly deal with such situations.
Cape Town to London via Doha these two flights with Qatar Airways was anazing. Ground and inflight service was excellent. Food was great aswell. The IFE on the B787 was not as good as the A380 though. If I could recommend one thing is that they update the Boeings IFE. Otherwise it was perfect. Everything was smooth. Especially the layover at Doha. What a nice airport. Both flights were on time and was almost no hassle at all. I slept easily on both. Cant wait to fly with them again. I am quite tall yet I had loads of space on the A380. Great plane. Space on the Boeing was good.
I have purchased a business class from Washington to Sofia via Istanbul. I have an emergency to change the date and 2 days already the agents refuse to change my date unless I purchase another ticket which is the same price as new one. I did some shopping around online just to see what other airlines are offering and they are cheaper elsewhere. Turkish Airlines want me to pay the full new ticket. What is the point to even use them any longer if they rip you off like that.
Chicago to Istanbul. Quick and smooth checkin at Chicago airport. Given a lounge invitation. Priority boarding. Onboard the seats very comfortable. Welcome drink offered opted for Champagne which was of great quality. Hot towel was given. Choice of magazines newspapers. Jaguar amenity kit given with excellent products. Soon after take of plenty of appetizers offered followed by delicious pumpkin soup main course desserts and teacoffee. Bed was made and had good night sleep. Breakfast orders were taken soon after take off. Before landing excellent breakfast was offered with fresh orange juice. Landed before time. Could not find any fault at all during entire flight.
Flight attendants were very polite and helpful. Its aircraft are not very well preserved the interior of the aircraft. The seats were comfortable but you could see they where a bit worn at their edges also the windows are very blurry and scratched.
Enjoyable flight. Check in was busy but I did not have to wait very long. Staff were friendly and efficient. The plane was very clean. It would be great if they offered more food options though. The plane left on time but there was a bit of a wait picking up luggage. Overall I was satisfied.
My flight from Cairo to Toronto was delayed 4.5 hours a few days before the flight schedule. Then it was delayed two hours the morning of the flight date. Nothing was provided by the airline except for a rude personnel telling me I have no accommodations. I had to purchase a one day pass for me and my daughter for 160 to rest since the layover became 10 hours instead of 5. This was my first trip with this airline and will be the last. Drinks on the plane included only Guava juice and water and the food was average. Getting off the plane in Toronto we had to take the bus for about 20 minutes to get to the terminal. It was an hour and a half from the time we landed to the time we get to the baggage claim area. They have 2 phone numbers for customer service in Toronto. I kept calling them a few times a day for a few days before the flight to pick my seats and they were always busy. The only time the phone rang is when there was a holiday and heard a message saying the office is closed.
Gold Coast to Hong Kong via Cairns. Check in at Gold Coast was less than 5 minutes. No Lounge Service for Business Class. Left on time for 2.5 hr flight to Cairns. Only a muffin and drink served for breakfast but crew were very attentive. 1.5 hour stop in Cairns. Relatively full flight to HKG. 2 full meal services 1 hour out of Cairns and 90 minutes before landing. Choice of 3 meals each service with 1 western and 2 chinese. Meals were good portions and very tasty. Plenty of drinks available with crew constantly checking for refills. Daytime flight so didnt take advantage of the fully flat seats which are very comfortable. AVOD was limited with understandably mainly chinese TV shows. Crew were very professional and chatty making for a very pleasant flight. Hong Kong Airlines Business Class deserves its 4 star rating.
I feel the need to say how pleased we were with our recent flight too Antalya from Bristol on 2522022. The crew going out to Antalya from Bristol was absolutely amazing. . As for disembarking from the flight the control they had by ensuring each row left the plane in order was to me amazing. Normally you are all trying to get out of your seats at the same time. The return flight from Antalya was a Wonderful experience too. I can only say it was the first time us using Jet2 but it definitely will not be our last. Well done for a first class service from a very grateful customer.
The passenger experience has worsened beyond imagination. Even though I was being seated in Business had little expectation for Asianas product as their fleet is aging without much refurbishment but now it seems that the flight crew is losing it. They forgot to serve my bread until the end of the meal in Business Class.
I showed them my ticket to board on the plane. They thought my suitcase was big then weighed it and also found my bagpack too big. They never showed me the number shown on the weight scale or informed me about why my bagpack was considered too big. Instead they were rude. After me insisting on knowing how many kilos my suitcase was they told me it was 9 kilos instead of 8 for which I had to pay 50 euros more. I feel that economy class passengers are treated with no respect in the airport and Aegean attempts to take more money from them making their life difficult in their airport. I would not recommend flying with Aegean. A sandwich and a cup of coffee on the airplane is not worthy of such bad customer service.
Dusseldorf to Hurghada. The service on board was friendly but keep in mind that drinks and food is not included in the ticket price. The drink and food menu offers a wide range of drinks and snacks. The legroom was decent however the seats had limited storage space. Tuifly is a typical holiday carrier expect children and a lot of noise. Overall the flight was enjoyable. The flight departed in time after arrival in Eqypt we were committed to scan our body temperature and fill out a health card due to the Coronavirus.
Gulf Air is an underrated airline. At first I was hesitant in using Gulf Air since most of the reviews about them are not good. When I saw that they are using 787 on their MNL flight I told to myself why not try their airline. On board MNL flight I was surprised that they have a chef and nanny on board. On the ground they also distribute pyjamas with slippers. They are offering dinner for their 1st service and breakfast before landing foods are tasty. I like their business class layout compared to Emirates Etihad and Saudia B777. Their seats are comfortable but they need to improve their inflight entertainment at least add more movies. I enjoyed my flight and I was able to sleep during the flight. Highly recommended.
Paris to Abu Dhabi. My flight was booked through Air France but was on an Etihad plane. Prior to the departure date I tried to book additional luggage online with Air France for 80 euros unaware that I was actually to fly with Etihad Airways. I was unable to book online for additional luggage and so called Air France. I was informed by Air France that although I wasnt able to book additional luggage online that they would put a note on my ticket for me to pay only 80 euros for the additional luggage when checking in at the airport. With this information I felt no need to investigate further. Upon arriving at the Charles de Gaulle airport to check in I was informed by Etihad Airways that I needed to pay 321.17 euros for the additional luggage They informed me that there was no note on the ticket. When asking Air France at the airport to assist me with this they informed me that the only note on the ticket was that I had attempted to book additional luggage online nothing about having to only pay 80 euros. Air France said they could do nothing about this situation and I had to pay the fee Etihad was demanding of me. Since I wanted to bring my belongings home and time was ticking I felt I had no option but to pay the amount demanded of me by Etihad Airways. Upon arriving in Australia I contacted Air France to request compensation for the additional amount I was asked to pay over the 80 euros. I informed them that had I known I would have had to pay such a high rate for the additional luggage with Etihad Airways I would have sought other cheaper methods to get my belongings home. Air France refused to give me the amount of 241.17 euros that I requested and said that I ought to ask Etihad Airways. I did not accept their suggestion since it was Air France at fault not Etihad Airways.
Urns Molina and Mariete Mayos were extremely helpful with my ticket reservation to Lima. I had missed the flight the day before and wasnt in the system and they figured out a solution and got me on board a flight. I think they went way way above the call of duty helping me and Im very appreciative. Your airline is lucky to have employees like them. Thank you ladies for all your help.
Chicago to Manila via Hong Kong. Worst flight experience. My boyfriend and I were thrown up on by a toddler sitting behind us for the last 7 hours of our 16 hour flight. When I asked if we could move seats we were told no because the available seats cost more than the seats we paid to fly in. In what world is it acceptable to expect a customer to sit in front of a child getting sick for 7 hours when there are other available seats I was told I would be contacted after our flight by customer service regarding this matter and still have not received a call. Ive sent 3 emails and sat on hold for an hour trying to speak to someone. Finally got through to an agent just to be told someone from customer service would call me back.
Qatar Business Class Quality Service in Economy. A number of friends recommended Qatar to us as we have never flown them before and departing from the Philippines our options were limited. To make matters harder we traveled with 2 rescue cats who are daughters rescued pre Covid but they were unable to return to pick them up so my wife and I flew them with us to the USA. Outstanding. From Checkin in Manila the entire staff were fantastic they genuinely cared a special thanks to Angelika. Due to a hernia I needed wheelchair assistance and the staff looked after me as if I was their own father. Food onboard great service great from Manila to Doha. Then the long sector Doha to Miami again excellent and more praise for flight attendant Ben. He immediately saw I had an injury and moved forward to assist with bags and that my wife and I were comfortable. During the long flight he checked we were ok. A top man and a genuine person. Thank you Ben. And Oh yes the kitty cats were well looked after given fresh water and food in Doha and are happy reunited with their mummy in the USA
BA is not treating its premium economy passengers with respect. You pay for a premium economy service and are then compelled to use the economy toilets at the back of the plane. This is shortchanging passengers.
Amman to London. We had the worst experience with them. Very bad service. Me and my wife were put in seats apart. Very bad meals never flying with them again. Personally I dont recommend it.
TimisoaraMunich. The flight was 1h 50 min and operated on a SAAB 2000 which was in pretty good shape I believe these are former Crossair props. Was offered a decent breakfast on this flight although a little bit disappointed that the cheese omlette was cold. Otherwise good selection of drinks and friendly crew. Overall a good deal for the price Would fly them again.
First the boarding gate is gate 1 in Hong Kong which is very close to the exit of the customs. The flight is on time arriving at the gate of Incheon airport at around 5.44am. The flight is quite smooth. The seat is quite comfortable. Note that this A333 economy seats have a fixed shell. The seatback is fixed. So the seat cannot recline backwards. Instead the seat kind of slides down. I quite like this idea. It means that the monitor will never be too close to you and you will not be annoyed by the one in front of you. The legroom is great. I fell asleep easily before taking off. About an hour later the meal is served. I was a bit disappointed that the meal was not an ordinary full size meal. There is no choice of main course. Usually there are two for passengers to choose from. The food is put inside a rectangle paper box the box is quite nice actually. There is a small bowl containing a few slices of fruits orange kiwi pineapple and one more. There is a sandwich with something like mayonnaise salad. And there is a biscuit. That is all. I do anticipate more but probably this is an overnight short flight 3 hours and 40 minutes departing at 1am. So Cathay thinks it is better to give you a light meal with mostly vegetables. I would be happier if it was a full meal. The inflight entertainment was excellent. It offers a great variety of HK Asia and western movies TV programmes and music. And touch screen monitor is responsive. Unlike the one fitted on Hong Kong airline where you have to touch it ten times before the screen senses your response.
HNDSIN was pretty poor. Cabin staff didnt seem very happy. Virtually had a bread roll thrown at me. Meal only one on a 7hour flight was not hot enough cold in places and tasteless. Bag drop at HND was a disgrace the online check in queue moved faster than the other one with only two desks open it took 40 minutes. There seems to be no benefit or reason to checking in online. The Singapore Airlines app is not very good either. SINLHRSIN were better. Good cabin staff and service and the food was hotter and better. Bag drop at LHR was smooth. Boarding well organized and smooth. The pilot explained a touch and go landing at LHR well and there was no panic but it did mean we were 20 minutes late and we were already a little behind schedule. Singapore airport is a pain as every gate as its own security check which took quite a long time on the outward trip. I prefer airports where no further checks are needed for transit passengers. SINHND was better and the meals were quite good as was the service. Plane was old though. Booked the tickets eight months in advance and they were never cheaper yet they were only reasonable. WiFi is only available if you register your Kris Flyer number before you board which I couldnt because Id already registered by ANA Mileage number. Why have this restriction
Singapore to Jakarta. Check in really smooth and without any troubles the staff guide us through the boarding gate seats. Seat with a lack of foot rest legroom acceptable able to charge devices. Service was exceptional Really good service. Entertainment with lots of variety however my IFE hangs a few times. Meal was horrible. Tasteless and lack of fruits Overall the meal is something they really need to improve on.
My flight got delayed to depart from Hong Kong so airline changed my connection flight from Doha which happened to be 8 hours after I landed in Doha. It gave me a chance to visit the city just for 6 hours. Both flights were great. Doha Kyiv crew were especially kind and professional. Loved it.
Out of 7 flights with 7 different companies they were the only ones weighing my carry on and even having a 23kg bag included they charged me 65 for it. It was the first and definitely the last time I fly with Jetstar. Its disgusting the way they rip people off.
Never understood how bad low cost airlines can be until I flew with French bee. Its impressively awful. None of my other experiences have nearly been as bad. The staff were pretty bad. Like I wave my arms and scream to get their attention and they somehow miss me from 2 feet away. I asked for water when they were walking around with the beverages but they walked right by me all 3 times out of 3. They push the cart right through at least 10 rows of seats. Once they were walking by with the beverage cart and went through 20 rows of seats until they decided to randomly stop. I assumed theyd return but they did not. The luggage was delayed by 2 hours. The check in process was a nightmare. Especially when Im on vacation I try to be understanding but some aspects were just avoidable. Delays happen thats ok but some issues were just unnecessary unprofessional and below the lowest standards.
Very impressed We booked an economy return flight from London to Melbourne via Dubai and BWN for the Easter Break. We hadnt planned on going to Oz but after finding an amazing price with Royal Brunei we had to go We had 6 flights In total and couldnt fault either of them. Flights were on time staff were very polite and couldnt do enough for you. The planes were clean. However the seats could have done with some more padding I was in the window seat on row 50 no windows for two of the flights. Avoid these seats if you can as the side of the aircraft encroaches on your space and became uncomfortable. The food was varied for all of our flights but was tasty. The crew were very attentive and were giving out drinks throughout each of the flights. The wait at BWN Is a tad on the long side but that would be my only gripe. I will definitely fly Royal Brunei again.
I booked a flight for myself and my daughter on 03 September 22 due to fly on 03 Jan 23 through Expedia. On 04 Oct 22 they cancelled my flight. I have sent countless emails and received no response. I called the call centre from the UK and was told that the money had been refunded to Expedia. I called Expedia and they said this never happens and called the GF centre and were told Id have my refund in 2 weeks. Nothing happened. I called expedia again who chases up and was told it would be 8 weeks. I waited 8 weeks and called again. Still no refund. Still no reply to over 10 emails. Nothing. This is the absolute worst customer experience I have ever had in my life. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. I only wish Id found this page of reviews first. Im still owed money for two flights. Trust this company at your peril. You have been warned
Hamburg to Mumbai via Dubai. Emirates has been long projecting themselves as a premium airline but things have gone down the drain. While making online checkin they only provide to reserve seats in the middle check the attached picture. Aisle seats are basically reserved for higher class of Economy. This is unacceptable because it should be based on first come first serve basis. Thats one of the reason why passengers do online checkin For the return flight aircraft was very light but the checkin staff was extremely stingy in regards with luggage. I was 3 kgs more than limit and when I pointed out the Emirates Online Published Baggage Policy that luggage not exceeding 32 kgs the staff abruptly replied this policy is only for US bound passengers. But this is not mentioned anywhere. Clearly she was dodging the rule. It seemed more like she has been instructed to shell out money. After after security check the manager still wanted to weigh hand luggage before final boarding. Even after boarding and settling down the manager came onboard to give us final notice that they might conduct a surprise check of hand luggage and have to pay double if found guilty. This was definitely the height Honestly I couldnt believe she made this announcement. On 3 out 4 flights they served absolutely the same food I couldnt see it anymore forget about eating it. The staff was of mixed bag ranging between okay and poor with forced to work and doing a favour attitude. I fly twice a year long haul and based on my experience I dont want to fly Emirates again. Their publicity and reality are worlds apart get your acts together Emirates Lots to learn from Singapore Airlines.
Paris to Papeete via Los Angeles. New plane which is nice but actually less comfy. The older planes where on a 242 seats setup newer are on a 333 setup which give you less room on your seat. Food is okay poor choice of entertainment but great staff really nice and kind.
Hong Kong to Auckland. Have flown Cathay Pacific a couple of times and love the service. On this flight we had the A350 aircraft it is quieter than the Boeing 777. The seats are the same as the boeing 777 basically. The service in business class is very very good better than other airlines we have flown with in both business and economy. The staff seem to go that much further.
After check in proceeded to gate to learn my La Compagnie flight had been cancelled due to technical issue. Were directed to lounge where deputy CEO explained that 20 seats were available on the evening flight to Paris. If we took this they would arrange onward flight to London. Hence ended up flying with delay to Paris where on arrival we were given vouchers for a Eurostar train to St. Pancras. No mention of any onward transport to Luton. Real story The Luton bound plane had no technical issue but the plane for Paris had. Because of higher seat booking on Paris flight La Compagnie decided to use the Luton plane and fly to Paris instead since it would be cheaper to transport 20 passengers from Paris to London than 35 passengers from Luton to Paris. Filed compensation request under EU law. Was offered a 650 voucher. I declined this who knows if they are still in business when I want to use voucher. After various email exchanges and threat to file formal complaint with CAA eventually La Compagnie agreed to credit card refund of Euro 600. Since they only have 2 planes any technical issue translates into delay or cancellation. Okay this happens but be honest about it and dont lie to me by claiming that you are doing me a favor by flying me to Paris when you just took my perfectly good plane to London away Food service on board eat before you depart General service requires improvement theyre specialists in ignoring you. Seat comfort is okay but not a 180 deg recliner Leg Room is excellent Would I use them again No way
Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Towns domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with madetoorder drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6 as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra 7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight and a hot breakfast with either a bacon sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly making casual jokes and giving a downtoearth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplaneboard. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737 it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways and they were the same price as the competition South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africas busiest air route. For the price paid Id be happy to fly them again.
Flying Business class to present work at Dubai Expo. My connection in Amman was short I asked them at the transfer would you be able to load my bag. The answer was of course. They delayed my bag no updates I keep calling airport after every RJ flight arrives to Dubai no luck. I am still stranded at the hotel with nothing. The strange part when I call them they keep in hold for 45 min the respond we will send your bag ASAP. I will avoid at any cost even if the alternative airlines has 3 connections.
Eva Air has one of the best airline lounges I have used. The quality of the food in their Infinity Lounge in Taoyuan Airport is excellent while the selection is wide. They even serve Haagen Dazs ice cream in their lounge. However the A330 plane they used for the TaipeiManila leg was old. The seat was hard and uncomfortable. Moreover the food that they served on business class was the worst business class meal Ive tasted. Eva Airs service may be good but the business class seats on this A330 and the food were bad.
Barcelona to Oakland. I originally booked with this airline because of the good prices for the flights. But I now regret this decision after being delayed on our outward and return flights. After reviewing this airline on the internet I have come to realize that this seems to be a regular occurrence with this airline. In the future I will definitely avoid this airline.
Very disappointed. I purposely packed lightly so I didnt have to check my bag and they overbooked the plane. I had to check my bag even though there was plenty of room to put it.
Although the service and food were excellent on this short less than two hour flight from Bangkok to Singapore the plane was the very old 777200 with the very old business class. The recline chairs upholstered in the dated blueishpurple fabrics. I think Singapore Airlines has only three of these left. I hope SQ gets rid of these planes soon for it is completely inconsistent with their other excellent equipment.
Madrid to London. Credit where its due. Flew club Europe and the crew were excellent. Friendly attentive and professional. The food was a good standard. The B767 has a dedicated business class cabin with larger seats. Think they will be phased out this year but a good example of good service.
TSA did not even put my baggage on the plane and i am two states away. very unprofessional and when i tried to contact it took over two hours just to talk to someone. Literally called baggage 84 times.
This was my worst experience since travelling. On my arrival in Trinidad instead of collecting both pieces of luggage for me and my husband we only received one. We filled out a PIR form. We were first told the next day Wednesday another flight will bring it. The next day I called and they said the flight is coming in at 4pm. When I called again they said 6pm instead. I called again and they said 1pm the next day Thursday. I called again and they said 1pm on Fri. They also confirmed that Curacao said they have the luggage. When I called at 215pm on Friday they said the flight is coming in at 11pm. An agent called my husband and told him Curacao said they do not have the luggage. I call soon after and another agent said he has to resend the email to Curacao that they got no response from Curacao but the flight is coming in at 11pm and hopefully our luggage will be in it. They will call us. Well I am waiting to hear what other story they are concocting next. Please avoid this airline like the plague. If you want stress you can travel with them.
The plane arrived 3 hours later in Istanbul airport and all this time we were waiting in the security zone. After one hour of flight we were brought food. The stewardess said that today only beef. But there was no beef. I asked where is the beef to which she replied that there was minced meat in the sauce. I showed her that in the sauce there is only fried tomato and eggplant. My body does not accept such food but the stewardess said that there is nothing to replace today. In front of me sat a young family with three children. After lengthy negotiations the children were brought chicken. Thank goodness at least the children were able to eat. After a ten and a half hour flight food was brought to us again but this time only chicken with no choice. This was my first negative experience with Turkish Airlines.
BA 084. YVR to LHR on August 28 2014. Premium economy. Much below previous experiences flying in this cabin on BA. Staff were indifferent and inattentive. The meals were deplorable Despite being a small cabin there was only one meal choice left half way through the dinner service a very heavy and overly rich pasta dish accompanied by an equally heavy piece of dry chocolate cake. Hardly suitable food for a long flight. Breakfast was worse an equally heavy fruit muffin and tea or coffee. Very poor A number of seats in this cabin have metal boxes underneath rendering the muchadvertised additional leg room useless. IFE far below what it used to be in terms of quality and variety of programming. A very unpleasant experience and definitely not worth the additional cost.
The attitude of the cabin crew has improved. The quality of films has improved as well but the screen is abysmal so one cannot really see the film. Or for some passengers around me their screens were not working at all. But what is disgusting with this airline is if there are delays and communication. The communication of the on ground staff is appalling first they do not know how to handle angry passengers they do not know how to keep the passengers updated and the airline does not have a CRM all complaints fileId directly with the airline will go into a black hole not even an acknowledgement of receipt. It is an unpredictable airline if you manage to get onboard service is ok but if something goes wrong such as cancellations which happen very often or long delays then only God can help you. The only choice we have on this route direct flight is British Airways and therefore if you have the choice it is preferable to avoid Air Mauritius.
Bangkok to Male in august 2018. As a regular user and premier member for Bangkok Air I was curious to see try their business class. I had accumulated an excessive amount of miles which I used for this flight. They charged about 200 in tax which is reasonable some airlines charge more or less tax for award tickets like these. The flight was 34 full on the way to the Maldives and completely empty on the way back. At check in it was a strange feeling when I walked up to the usual business class counter to check in for my first international flight with them. The premier lounge was quite empty when we were there first and then gradually filled up to capacity. There is hot food table service but recently this has been discontinued. There is only self serve but there are still madetoorder items available. Instead of doing a boarding announcement a gate agent walked around the boarding area with a sign up saying business classPremier members which is actually a much better idea than making an announcement. I was first onboard and was asked what I would like to drink. I settled with orange juice. For a half past nine departure lunch was served and the quality and quantity was more than adequate. They understand that you will definitely eat in the lounge and not feel that hungry once on board. I felt that the clear plastic bowl of salad with royal project branding theyre a subsidised group of highquality farmers was a bit odd but then the salad definitely felt fresh. The hot meal was also good and there were 3 choices. We were also served macadamia nuts in a bowl before meal service. I asked if there was any snack before landing and they only had more nuts. Drinks were plenty and me and my dad didnt realise we finished an entire bottle of champagne as they just kept refilling The seat is more than comfortable like a big lazyboy. The crew seemed odd. The usual interactive ness and downtoearth feeling wasnt there it felt as if asking for something in the galley something Id always do was met with a weird look. The flight attendant asked me to press the call button but I personally like going to the galley and asking for something as its better for both. Entertainment is provided in the form of an iPad and is adequate for the flight duration. Arrival in Maldives I wish I could say that our bags were first off the belt but no. It was quick though. The return journey felt literally like a private jet. We walked straight up to the counter and we were given fast track immigration. Turns out the regular line had no queue at all so we just went to the regular line Boarding was called for 40 minutes before departure and we were still in the lounge when not 5 minutes later final call for flight PG712 to Bangkok. So we ran down to the gate. There was No line. Turns out the load factor on this flight was 21 in total. Including economy passengers thats a 41 ratio of passengers to cabin crew. Leaving 30 minutes early then arriving 45 minutes early. When we got to the gate which was a domestic gate the flight continues on to Samui the crew shut the curtain between economy and made sure it stayed shut and we were whisked off to a private minivan. The minivan took a shortcut to international arrivals and we were literally out without any other passengers in sight with our baggage in tow. That is the best Bangkok to Male in August 2018.arrival experience ever. Overall I am used to flying Bangkok air on short routes and they perform okay on medium haul.
Extremely bad customer service. There are always delays and I have had the problem of adding extra luggage a few times they say that you can add it for 30 euros official fee and when you try they say its not possible and that you have to pay 70 euros instead at the airport to do so They never reply to any emails or messages or complaint forms etc. The tickets cost a fortune and they dont even offer a glass of water for a fivehour flight. The seats are becoming harder less comfortable and narrower and Brussels Airlines is acting like a low cost airline which it most definitely is not given the exaggerated fees. What a rip off Highly disappointed.
Bangkok to Shanghai. I received an email message from the airlines stating that my flight was canceled and for me to contact them. In the email they sent me they never provided a contact number. I had to google for their website and contact number. I called them more than 15 times on different occasion and all I got was answering machine with no option to leave a message. The email they sent me says do not reply as it was sent through an automessaging system. It was difficult to reach them through the phone. I have no other option but wait until I get to the airport and talk to them in person. When I get to the airport and ask them to issue me a new itinerary since the original one was canceled by the airline. They still cant help me but provide me with another phone number to call customer services. I finally got a new itinerary for my flight with China Eastern. The flight was a little more than 4 hours. The minute we boarded the plane I can feel the air inside the plane was extremely warm. I thought the Flight Attendant will turn on the air conditioner once the plane starts to leave the tarmac but they did not. I waited for a long time for the Flight Attendant to come down the aisle so I can ask them to turn on the AC but I did not see one came by. I looked for a call button on my chair but did not find one since it was so dark in the plane. I waited for a long time no flight attendant came down the aisle. I felt exhausted and fall back to sleep. I sat in the middle seat so it was hard for me to climb over another passenger to find the Flight Attendant. On my way to the lavatory I tried to look for a flight attendant and hopefully have them turn on the AC but did not see a single flight attendant around. Its been like this throughout the entire flight. We were never offered drinks or meals. The seats are tiny. Even with my arms close to my body my arms still rubbed by other passengers sitting next to me.
I used Qatar Airways to fly from Cairo to Houston the service was great the flight attendants were very friendly. the plane was the newest model. My overall experience was good from the check in to landing. The crew very nice the seats are comfortable good food. I fly economy class and to date this has been my most comfortable flight. I will look for Qatar Airways flights in the future
New York to Johannesburg via Dubai. I accompanied my teenage son to a short internship in a private conservation area in South Africa. He was tasked with photographing all the researchers operating in that area and therefore had to take expensive photographic gear. We showed that gear to the Emirates checkin manager in New York who gave us no trouble at all for carrying it on as hand luggage. Leaving Johannesburg Emirates agents stopped us and the manager treated us terribly telling us that we couldnt take the gear on the plane that it was a safety hazard blah blah. Our checked luggage was very light so we were not over in terms of the weight we were bringing on the flight. He told us that our only option was to sign a liability form and put the lenses in the hold. We might as well have thrown the gear into the street and watched the trucks run over it. This was the day before Christmas and the airline basically threw us out to find our own way home at holiday time even though they had allowed us to fly in. We got no refund. We had to buy sameday tickets home on Delta and by the way our hand luggage did not come even close to falling out of the overhead storage on that airline. I will never fly Emirates again.
Casablanca to Dubai. I received a confirmation mail after my payment with SMS proving it on early July 2022. 2 months later I tried to check in the day of departure of my flight and I had an error indicating that I should contact call center. They indicated that they never received the payment and hence never issued the ticket. I checked my bank account and indeed it seems the payment did not go through for some reason. Now what makes me insane is WHY does the company send emails to confirm the flight if there is an issue in the payment WHY no one at RAM notified me that there was a payment issue A simple automated email would have sufficed WHY the service agent was so rude in handling my request. Clearly he did not put himself in client shoes when asking me to pay 3 times the initial price to fix the issue and did not apologize any single time. He did not allow me to speak to his manager. An airline company without an escalation path is a red flag. For those who can I heavily suggest to avoid them at all cost. Since I could not fly with them I rated 1 for the handling of my ticket and 3 for the flight related aspects in order to keep a neutral rating
Istanbul to Singapore. Best cabin crew experience and very helpful during the 10 hour flight. Served frequently snacks and drinks. I personaly congratulated chief of cabin crew who didnt stop to serve passengers during the whole flight. I will seriously consider to fly again with Singapore.
Flying IcelandAir has honestly been one of the worst experiences of my life. A significant portion of my luggage was lost by the airline. It has been almost 14 days. I have submitted multiple claims and none of them have been responded to. Staff are rude refuse to provide policies that they are referencing on my rights as a consumer and they do not allow for me to raise my complaints with a supervisor. Currently I am in Greenland on business without the proper clothing and resources to do my trip safely. I have missed out on important meetings and I am virtually confined to my room with the temperatures and IcelandAirs unwillingness to provide compensation that can be used up front for the clothing and gear that I need. IcelandAir is neglectful and they do not respond online offline or with sufficient information to keep their passengers safe and supported after they have collected their revenue.
I had to purchase this flight at the very last minute when Jetstar cancelled my flight. I enjoyed the flight. Service was friendly and efficient and the flight left on time. The meal was ok although the taste was a bit dry. The wine served was both delicious. and generous. By and large a good flight.
Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City via Bandar seri Begawan. Royal Brunei Airlines provided comfortable travel experience the services are excellent and you get a chance to stop over to visit Brunei with friendly people and explore the natural wonders of the island.
Mauritius to Perth. Flight to Mauritius was delayed for 2 hours. No explanation then was cancelled with no warning. A guy from Air Mauritius came out and yelled over the top of everyone saying flight has been cancelled come back tomorrow at the same time then just walked off like that. No one knew what was going on or what to do. Then when we returned the next day the flight was delayed a further 4 hours with the same poor service. Now on my way home flight is delayed a further 2 hours with the same appalling service. What a joke of an airline and the staff need to work on their customer service too
We flew with Air Transat on January 1 2023 from Toronto to Puerto Plata on TS 844 and returned on January 8 2023 on flight TS 845. A most enjoyable flight and excellent flight crew in both directions. They made our air travel very comfortable and relaxing. We would recommend Air Transat to anyone flying to use .
Paris to Windhoek via Frankfurt. We have flown Air Namibia a few times. Their inflight service and ontime arrivals were quite good. The way they handled connecting flights for us however was incompetent and the general customer service which was needed as a result was incredibly poor. We booked our 13 year old son to Paris on Air Namibia. While the connection via Frankfurt connection flight on Lufthansa was o.k. on the way back Air Namibia booked him on an Air France flight from Paris to Frankfurt with onward connection to Windhoek on Air Namibia. In Paris he was denied boarding on the grounds that Air France unlike Lufthansa has a minimum age requirement for alone travelling juniors of 14 years. Lufthansas minimum age is 12. Air France checkin staff said that he should have never been booked that way by Air Namibia as the age of the traveler is obviously known when the booking is made. When he was denied boarding we rushed to the Windhoek Airport asking Air Namibia staff for help and to rebook our son on LH connecting flight for the next day. We were surprised that while admitting their mistake they charged us for the rebooking LH instead of AF and said we should contact Customer Service for a refund. Apart from a holding reply after 2 days we have not heard back from them in more than 3 months. Reminders were ignored. Not only a very incompetent booking system but also a customer service which is nonexistent. Sad for an airline which otherwise tries hard to compete. We might fly them again for any easy nonstop flights but certainly not for any trip that requires a connecting flight.
Flown from Seattle to Incheon and then Incheon to Singapore with Korean Air. I was satisfied with the performance and service rendered by the ground crew in Seattle and Incheon. The seat 33A was spacious by my standard 5 5 and 130 pounds. Sufficient leg room. Even though the plane was full there was sufficient overhead compartment space for every passenger to put their hand luggagebags. Flight crew on both legs were friendly and attentive. Food wise it was sufficient but the taste left much to be desired. KE does not provide packets of salt and pepper. Entertainment was limited Im being spoilt by the 100 movies and TV shows on Emirates and Qatar Airways and came only in 4 languages predominantly English and Korean..
Hong Kong to Melbourne. I havent traveled with Cathay Pacific Airway for years I used to really impress of this flight but not this time after years that I came back to this airline. Sorry to say but it could be a lot better these days. I hope this airline can be improved and up to date. I would hope to travel with Cathay Pacific again where I can feel more welcome comfortable seat better food and drink service also more attentive service.
The flight Paris to Bristol in April was cancelled because the captain didnt like the look of something on the plane. Instead of an early flight we eventually got to Bristol after midnight not much use for the work planned that day. Their way of fooling you is simple agree quickly that you deserve the 250 euros compensation but then do nothing. When you complain they say the payment was made that it then came back to them or whatever. Its now September and I realise they never had any intention of making the payment.
London Heathrow to Madrid. An absolute third world experience once I got on the plane. Checkin and lounge experience were great but once I got onboard it became obvious how clapped out some of the 767 aircraft are. There were seats with missing backs and Do Not Occupy covers in front and beside them random bits of electrical wiring hanging down from rails in the overhead and grimy yellowed staining around most of the cabin interior. You have to worry about whats going on the important bits like the engines if the same standard is applied outside the aircraft as in the cabin. The crew spent as much time as they could in the galley and interacted with passengers as little as possible. The breakfast service was a saltinfused hot cooked offering and just one run of drinks. Anything else you wanted you had to use the call button. The one and only reason I booked this cabin was that it was actually just a few pounds more expensive on the overall ticket routing Id bought.
London Heathrow to Copenhagen with British Airways and I was surprised by the service. Customer service was poor particularly on my outward trip. Some of the cabin crew seemed disinterested and did not even greet you as you came onboard they continued to talk amongst themselves and ignore customers. The seats were uncomfortable and the little lunch they provided was atrocious.
Flew Qatar Airways from Bangkok to Doha. Brand new plane nice seat and great IFE. Its always better to fly on a new plane and the 787 is one of the best plane nowadays. Many movies and a lot of games available on the IFE. We had 2 meals first a 3 course meal and 1 hour before landing 1 hot sandwich and a cake.
Copenhagen to Vagar Faroe Islands and the Atlantic Airways A319 was still quite new and had the feature of mood lighting which you dont see on many European short haul aircraft. The cabin layout was very nice. The food was simple but good a nice little wrap salad with fresh salmon bread and little miniRittersport chocolate. Very surprised that only 45 minutes after the meals drinks service they did a second drink service a full aircraft on a 2.05hr flight. The service was friendly and the lady who served me was most charming. A simple short haul flight but very pleasant
I purchased two tickets to ensure I have comfort and room to spread out. Got through Atlanta fine they gave me my ticket but there was an issue at the gate which was resolved. Arrived in Doha and everything went smoothly from there to KL. On the return flight I was delayed hours before they reprimanded me for purchasing two tickets as that was against their regulations. My ticket and my trip were deleted from the app and had to be redone at the airport with the trip never reappearing on my app nor the option to review them. Arriving in Doha the ticket had to be redone a second time and I was forced to show them receipts for my purchases. Flights were enjoyable but I will never fly them again.
The flight I booked was cancelled as a result of Covid. I requested a refund which was rejected by Air Transat instead they offered a credit for future travel. I spend my winters in Mexico and Air Transat is no longer flying to Mexico a credit is useless to me. I only fly to Mexico.
HKGBKKHKG. Outbound Flight HX765 delayed by almost 2 hrs Inbound Flight HX762 delayed by around 30 mins. Flight delay seems to be a norm at this airline. Only pork bun and basic drinks were served inflight. Aircrafts were slightly old. Limited choices of Inflight Entertainment. However the flight attendants are young energetic and eager to serve.
The business class experience on the QSuite is truly exceptional as I found out on another flight but as far as Economy Class goes Qatar is far from the best. The seat was quite uncomfortable in terms of seat width and legroom. The cabin crew service was spotty the headphones handed out when boarding was not working and it took 3 hours for the crew to find me a replacement headset.
It was my first time travelling on Emirates Airlines. Flew from Singapore to Dubai with my family of 4. The ICE entertainment system could not be loaded for us and at least another 5 to 6 rows of passengers in the center row for the entire flight of more than 7 hours. We thought we paid for a premium airline but got a budget flight experience instead. The air crew could not care less there was just an announcement on board that the inflight entertainment for some passengers cannot be restarted. Two attempts to get the attention of the air stewardesses through the help button for a separate matter were ignored and not responded to at all. It has been two weeks and Emirates has not responded to my feedback. I usually travel with Asian airlines which really compares way better in terms of hospitality inflight service and facilities.
YYCATH with change in Zurich. One of the best charter flights I have been on nice cabin interior good meals friendly staff and on time. Inflight entertainment very limited not a problem for me.
Dusseldorf to Hong Kong. Efficient checkin and security checks at DUS. However the waiting area for nonSchengen flights after the passport control is tiny not big enough or have enough seats even for one A350 flight not to mention there were also other flights to UK etc. Brand new plane with comfortable seats. However theres no hard protection between seat pocket and seat in front therefore when the person behind you puttake some thing in the pocket you will feel everything. Mediocre meals were too salty. Good service by the cabin attendants but definitely not on the same level of friendliness or attentiveness compared to some other Asian airlines with 5star rating.
My seat was dirty. For food we were given no options for 1 meal and 2 options for the second. They came by twice with drinks for the entire 1011 hour flight. We each had a screen in front of us that didnt work. Would have been worth it if I had my luggage with me. Landed on Friday in New York and it took till Wednesday to get our luggage.
Flew Monarch Airlines from Manchester to Porto. Pleasantly surprised. Booked an extra legroom seat outbound and was pleasantly surprised by the legroom. Inbound however was a standard seat and was tight to say the least 510 tall. I would certainly opt for extra legroom on future bookings. Service although buy on board was courteous and efficient and the food quality was actually fine. It puts the budget airline British Airways to shame. Being able to pay cash was a bonus. Outbound was running around an hour late and I received an email from Monarch whilst in the airport to say rescheduled which was a nice touch. Inbound was just as efficient and arrival in Manchester was on time. Overall I would book again providing the flight schedules are suitable.
Chaotic checkin at Gatwick as plane had been changed and everybodys reserved seats had to be changed. We had paid extra for up front extra leg room seats but didnt get them. Still allocating seats at departure gate so plane was late into Lisbon. Great flight from Lisbon to Sao Tome flight less than half full. Was bussed to aircraft and then waited nearly half an hour on a hot enclosed bus to board. I have arthritis and was in a lot of pain having to stand for that long. Food was inedible. Flight back was awful. Took 3 hours to book in in a very hot booking hall and flight left nearly 2 hours late. Flight was full and arrived at a remote stand in Lisbon. Once again on a packed bus. Just managed the connection to London and amazed that our luggage arrived with us. Will avoid using TAP in future.
Absolutely woeful experience flying with Turkish airlines. Started off the day with a 3hr delay which made me miss their connecting flight. I spent about 12 hours at Istanbul airport with no sign of a transfer on the cards even after i was told 3hrs into my wait that id be able to catch another flight in 4 hours. The last call time came for that plane and they still werent able to get the transfer done
Usually I can take a carry on and did on my way to Florida but on the way back they charged me for my carryon and told me only backpacks were allowed. Then when I went to pay they said they couldnt take cash it had to be a card. Ive never been treated so badly at the stand. They didnt help guide anyone and when booking the flight months earlier they didnt prewarn anyone this would happen. The staff on the way back were rude. Totally different then my flight there they helped when not sure where to go and did not charge me for my carry on which was 45 dollars I think they were just being greedy on the way back.
Flight from Gatwick to Grenada return with British Airways. Lounge in south terminal was good flight and staff were good decent food and the plane was clean. What I struggled to get my head around is after paying for business class flights BA then expect you to pay an additional 77 per person each way to reserve seats. There were 4 of us traveling so that adds in excess of 600 to our flight cost. BA will tell you that this is free 24 hours before departure but actually 3 days before departure most seats had gone. I would expect after paying for business class that you automatically get seated together but it appears not as there was one couple on the return flight who had not reserved seats after paying for business class and were made to stand in the galley until everybody had boarded to if there were 2 seats together.
I have flown Icelandair numerous times in the past its been my preferred travel route to Europe. Ive always had a good experience until recently. I am so incredibly disappointed in the poor customer service my boyfriend and I have received recently. I booked a trip to Europe to visit friends and naturally I booked with Icelandair. My boyfriend decided he wanted to fly out to join us a few days into my trip. Per my recommendation we booked him with Icelandair. During the time of booking there was no travel restrictions for American tourists traveling to the Netherlands our destination. For layovers in the KEF airport it was required for American tourists to provide a negative COVID test OR a proof of vaccination. My boyfriend was scheduled to depart our local airport on September 5th. On September 4th the travel restrictions were altered and suddenly both a negative test and proof of vaccination was required. When my boyfriend arrived at the airport he was denied boarding onto his plane. He is not vaccinated but was able to provide the negative test. This was no longer sufficient. This caused numerous issues and loss of funds for both of us throughout my entire trip. When we contacted customer service regarding the refund we were told that he would not be issued one I am just besides myself at the unwillingness to help us due to the circumstances. This is completely ridiculous. Not only was this of no fault of ours we also purchased the Travel Protection Plan We were still told that he has been listed as a No Show and our situation doesnt fit into the policy for any of the refund guidelines. I understand that times are strange and restrictions change almost daily why we purchased the protection plan. I cant believe this company is profiting off of passengers who have already been inconvenienced tremendously at no fault of their own. We are being forced to pay for a series of flights that were never taken refused a refund for the because of what The airline wasnt inconvenienced at all. The airline lost no money by him not being on the flight. This is terrible business extremely unethical and terrible treatment of a customer. I will never fly Icelandair ever again. I will make sure no one in my family my friends or anyone in my industry flies with Icelandair again.
I recently flew with BlueAir from Liverpool to Alicante. I had never heard of BlueAir before and was slightly worried about flying with them thinking it would be an old aircraft and crew you couldnt understand and you would be lucky to arrive on time. But they were brilliant a fairly new B737 very clean fantastic crew very friendly and professional nothing too much trouble. And very surprised to get either a free hot or cold drink. Both flights were early so overall very impressed and will definitely book BlueAir again..
Toronto to Dublin. The worst airline anyone could ever think of with ridiculous service and overworked staff. Lost baggage and nobody is even looking for it. My worst experience in air travel.
Goa to London via Doha. One needs to give credit when credit is due Ive always said. Ive flown with Qatar Airways on and off over the years whether it be from UK to India India to Australia or UK to Australia. Ive also flown with other airlines all over the world and over many years. Fortunately I dont do three flights a week anymore and its only a handful of long hauls a year now. But every time Ive flown with Qatar Airways its been a very pleasant experience. The staff are by far the best Ive dealt with for politeness and fantastic customer service. The flight details I listed above on 30th May QR523 and QR007 from Goa to London where my 11 year old son Frank Hewett travelled as an unaccompanied minor I felt so at ease with the service Qatar Airways provided. From the time they collected Frank and delivered him to my wife in London I was kept up to date on the progress and even the phone calls to let me know he had lost his mobile phone in the airport lounge. Little be known to me Qatar Airways upgraded him to business class from Goa to Doha. I honestly thank Qatar Airways and the staff for looking after my son and gave me the peace of mind knowing he was completely looked after from start to finish.
Flew Bangkok to London. Its been a few years since I regularly flew business class with British Airways. I always used to look forward to the big seats a boozy afternoon watching movies and being treated a little bit special. Fast forward and the lounges are generally borrowed from other airlines that make you feel like a second class citzien the planes are tired with worn out interiors and all of this is reflected in other passengers dissapointment in a generally lack lustre flying experience. For better value and added smiles Ive found the premium economy offering must better value for money.
From the moment we started boarding the plane at 1135am on 20112022 for a conference in Uluru the flight attendant Andrew had everyone laughing. This continued throughout the entire trip which made it so much more enjoyable. If only all flights had an Andrew on them Id feel so much more comfortable flying. I would recommend Jetstar because of this experience.
Mexico City to Puerto Vallarta. After reading reviews I was a little concerned about this flight. Checkin at Mexico City Airport was seamless with an agent that spoke excellent English as my wife and I do not speak Spanish. The airline allows a generous 25 kg of checked luggage and 10kg of take on luggage per person at no extra cost. The Delta flight to Mexico City from New York charged USD30 per checked bag and we paid for Comfort plus seats which offered a few inches more leg room than regular economy. The biggest surprise was entering the cabin a very new aircraft with the most room in economy I have encountered in years and years. I fly a lot for work in Australia and Qantas should look at this airlines seat configuration as it sets what I believe is a gold standard of what economy should be not like being cramped in like battery hens. The flight was smooth and fast the crew friendly and the service offered for a low cost airline at no additional cost for a short 59 minute flight consisting of drink and snack more than adequate. Bravo Interjet We would fly you again.
Venice to Dubai 12 November. Check in very good at Marco Polo Airport. Some one in Emirates uniform directing passengers. At check in the staff not wearing Emirates uniform but excellent customer service and said she would check if once we arrived in Australia she could give us boarding pass for our Qantas connection in Brisbane for final destination but was not able. Later at boarding gate called over and received Boarding pass for final onward journey. The flight to Dubai was good Allocated twin seats which booked and paid for and Excellent Gluten free meal served early. Cabin crew came around with water and soft drinks between meals and we arrived safely in Dubai for onward connection to Brisbane.
Santa Cruz to Cochabamba Cochabamba to La Paz. This airline tries hard to fill the gap left by the collapse of Aero Lloyd Boliviano but is still plagued by constant changes to schedules usually because the aircraft flying the international route Brazil is late in arriving in Santa Cruz and therefore delays the local flights. It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights it is really important to reconfirm flights and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled. The airline is fine if you are not in a hurry and dont mind delayed flights changed schedules and dont mind having confirmed tickets ignored.
Just been back from the trip from Sydney via Abu Dhabi to Moscow and return. S7 flight was combines with Etihad. Both companies cooperated very well during the entire trip very easy process from buying the tickets to changing the return date at the shortest notice. Staff was very supportive and knowledgeable. Not a single drama with S7. I was very pleasantly surprised and will recommend using them. Will definitely buy tickets through them for my next trip to Russia.
London Heathrow to Bangkok. We had already flown BA10 from Bangkok to London a month ago so were really hoping that we got better seats in the crazy business class seating on this route. Of course we had to pay extra to reserve the seats but wanted to make sure we were together so booked J and K seats. Check in at LHR was good lounge at T5 was packed Friday afternoon and I was not happy that we had to be bussed to flight. No priority boarding and when bus arrived the whole herd boarded into business class door and we couldnt even get to our seats On boarding toilet in business class was out of order with a scribbled note stuck on the door why wasnt it fixed prior to the flight. For some reason throughout the flight people were coming into business class to use the toilet which angered me as staff did not stop them. Constant queues for toilet with one not in action and other cabin passengers using the business toilet Not good enough. Food and wine were OK and crew were good. Flat bed was good. Disembarking was slow. Same movies as BA10 four weeks earlier.
The seat is comfortable the personal entertainment was the perfect screen size the airplane new the food delicious and the service above and beyond They offer an amenity kit and a hygiene kit. Overall an excellent job and a great thanks to the cabin crew that were just exceptional and hard working.
I was dissatisfied with the business class flight from Paris to Mumbai round trip. The flat bed was more like a recliner seat and my food was not up to the quality. Flight back from Paris to LAX took off late and I was very hungry. Flight attendant gave me menu I chose salmon she mentioned that is not available since it has been taken. No issues but when I paid a premium to travel business should not I expect better. Given vegetarian which was very salty.
The worst flight I have ever been the customer service is poor. Cabin crews were rude and they even dont know how to talk to the passengers. The flight is too noisy and not comfortable. They even dont know to speak English.
Paris Orly to Newark. This was the worst flight I have ever taken including domestic and international. The seats were broken with absolutely no space and this was an 8 hour flight. The crew were rude and had no knowledge of the plane. Water was 3 and blankets were 5. We booked through Norwegian and had no idea until got on plane that we werent flying Norwegian. The food was inedible. We had flown the last 3 weeks in 5 different airlines and had not experienced anything like this.
GRJJNB. 18 hours before departure I received a text advising that the flight scheduled for the next morning at 10.40 was delayed until 14.30. As this was going to inconvenience me I tried calling them to see if I could reschedule. This is where I saw how abysmal Kulula after sales service is. After listening to 25 minutes of inane drivel at R2.40 a minute telling me how wonderful their service is and how all their agents were just waiting to pick up the phone and help me I gave up. Later I contacted the office at George Airport where the response was unhelpful and I was offered a refund. The alternative SAA flight would have at that point cost me R800 more. I wish I had booked SAA from the beginning but foolishly thought it was worth saving some money. That said I understand that flights can be delayed I was notified in advance and when I checked in I was given a R250 voucher to use on a future Kulula booking and the service and flight were satisfactory. I dont like the Kulula jokey approach and the funny announcements most of the FAs simply cant pull it off and its just irritating.
Dubai to Heathrow. I would like to thank the pilot co pilot and all the cabin crew on board flight EK005 on 29102019. They were extremely professional in their duties polite and very welcoming. I was very impressed by your kindness to a passenger with a medical issue who you relocated to the cabin crew seats behind me. I will definitely choose Emirates next year. Thank you for a pleasant flight.
1st Class LHRPHX. Totally seamless flight. Great driver collection through concierge service granted it was extra. Concorde room was lovely great staff and nice breakfast. First class service onboard staff were very good. Producing a very nice custom meal for my wife.
I am deeply disappointed with Turkish Airlines customer service. Despite multiple attempts to contact them regarding urgent travel issues there has been no response. This experience has shattered my trust in the airlines commitment to customer care. A prompt and efficient response is crucial in the travel industry and Turkish Airlines has failed to meet this basic expectation. This lack of communication has added unnecessary stress to my travel plans. This was the worst customer service that I have had. I strongly advise potential passengers to consider this before choosing Turkish Airlines for their journey.
We have twice now flown the Newark Orly route on Open Skies originally in April 2012 then again in December. The first time the flight was described as Biz Seat and the entire airplane was configured with their biz seats. These are good but not great seats adequately sized for the most part but just not quite long enough for a 6 ft individual and 100 manual recline and leg rests. The portable av systems were in many ways superior to the typical major carrier central av systems but on both outbound and inbound legs the batteries were not adequately charged and it ran out before arrival. No backup so I was out of luck. The all biz seat arrangement meant fast loading fast unloading and relatively rapid bag delivery. Food and wine were not bad but nothing special. On time for the most part. Good enough to do it again in December. By December the offering had morphed a bit. Same seats but now the plane was a 757 and was configured as biz bed business class Prem Plus premium economy the prior Biz Seat config and regular 6 across economy. The seats were the same. The foodwine in Prem Plus were strictly economy sub mediocre and the baggage delivery horrible at ORY. The av systems had been upgraded to new ipads which worked well but still needed more management of battery charging. The prior rapid boarding was lost with the larger plane and 3 class seating. Bottom line at 1250 per person rt its a lot more comfortable than economy but you no longer get a biz lounge invitation and the food was really bottom of the barrel. Id do it again because the itinerary is perfect for my needs but dont do it if youre expecting business class at economy pricing.
We flew the wonderful StarFlyer aircraft from Kansai to Tokyo Haneda. The checkin staff was extremely friendly and quick and their security line had nobody in it. The boarding was speedy we timed it and we got on and took off within 25 minutes. We were dissatisfied by the fact that we could not redeem United miles as the airline is partly owned by ANA. overall the flight was above and beyond.
Boston to Kuwait via Dubai. I was very impressed with all staff from check in on. I used wheelchair assistance and they were so kind and friendly. The crew on the aircraft were excellent.
Flew Newcastle to Birmingham with Eastern Airways for the first time today and found the flight comfortable and flight attendant polite courteous and professional. The plane was loud but thats to be expected for a small plane. I would definitely recommend and fly again with them.
London to Sao Paulo Guarulhos. British Airways Boeing 747s looks very old outdated and in need of an urgent update. I heve flown 8 times in the past 2 month always in their Boeing 747s and all of them were in the same condition. I just hope that the maintenance in the vital systems are better than inside the aircraft as one can see in the attached pictures taken from my seat in the upper deck in my last flight. Also the entertainment system is very limited.
Houston to Beijing. The flight was good but not the customer services and the website. The website is confusing even when we typed in the correctexact ticket and name it did not recognize our name and we cant do anything online for any change. Also when requesting the mileage to be added to my other Star Alliance frequent flyer the customer representative behaved very rudely and without any courtesy made me wonder who actually is the customer here. Will not fly with them again.
Flew Cape Town to Harare with Rwandair. The flight attendants were cheerful and very helpful. The space inside the plane was excellent and so was entertainment. However my checking in was a total nightmare. Spent almost 30 minutes trying to check in. As if the attitude wasnt enough I was travelling with a minor and had a lot of bags the lady kept asking me to remove my bags from the scale and put them back on the floor. She did not know how to check in a minor hence kept calling her supervisor who was busy chit chatting. She miscalculated my excess lagguage only for me to correct her she did not even use a calculator. Asked me if I wanted to pay with cash or card and I told her card only for her to say we only take cash. Why didnt you just say so in the 1st place. As if that is not enough she spent a good 2 minutes asking me questions like Are you sure you can identify the goods in your bags are these your bags are there any fragile material How can I be checking in bags that are not mine and if there was something fragile that needed proper handling dont you think I would have told you Late Departure also. Since its a new route I think the overall experience was just satisfactory.
For this 5 hour 15 min flight you are given a bag of potato chips and a bottle of water. If you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone. Or like me you can preorder weeks before you fly. However there is no guarantee you will get your order mine never came so after enquiring where the order was they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane that someone was me it turned out. They also managed to lose my luggage. I am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it. I will never use them again.
Hong Kong to Doha. Check in at the In Town Check In in Central is very convenient . I was told I have the reserved window seat but I checked twice and it was not the seat I reserved. I had expected a QSuite but the plane was a Boeing 777 with a 222 configuration in business class. I complained but the very friendly staff at check in cant do much. I had complained to Qatar airways and they just say that they can change planes according to their conditions of carriage. Boarding was smooth and the flight left on time. The seating is an old business class seat. Seating comfort is very limited and I could not use it for sleeping. Entertainment is the usual movie program. Wifi was not available on this plane. Another surprise was the very limited offer of food with no main course breakfast of Scrambled Eggs with Chicken Sausage a main course. The cabin staff did its best very friendly and willing to cope with me being a bit grumpy on this flight. I cant recommend Qatar unless you need a non stop connection to Doha.
London to Belfast. Check in was fast and efficient and using the BA Terminal5 First Class check in and security area was really good and I was straight into the lounge. Great selection of food and drinks early morning. I really like the BA boarding process i.e.by Group numbers. The onboard service and quality of breakfast served was excellent. Overall very happy with this short flight with BA.
Tashkent to Istanbul. Check in Tashkent was chaos People where checking in boxs of eggs and fresh produce to sell in Istanbul. I quickly slipped into the business line and saved 20 minutes from the check in process. When we all assembled in the depart lounge the pre boarding sequence went out of the window. People standing closest to the door where on 1st. This ruffled a few business travellers big time. The airplane was a well used and tired aircraft the interior was well used featured cramped and un comfortable economy seats. Boarding was swift and the crew did a manual safety briefing before a quick take off. The inflight services was a limited range of drinks and tea. The meal options where greasy riced based meals with donner meats. There was no flight entertainment. The flight was over soon enough and we disembarked on a jet way with easy connection to my next flight.
The flight was really uncomfortable expensive and they do not have vegetarian food only if you choose in advance. They lost my baggage and are not able to give me any sort of information on it and they cannot give me information on how much I will be compensated.
Prague to Amsterdam. Forced to check a carry on bag at the gate pay 45 Euro and then they lost my bag. To make matters worse I was connecting on a different airline to Toronto and then Vancouver. So I had to exit the secured area and pass security a second time. Rude impatient dismissive. A truly bad experience from start to finish. I will never fly with them again.
Fabulous service from beginning to end from the chauffeur service check in lounge and the flight on all 4 flights from Perth to Manchester via Dubai and the return journey. Every member of the Emirates team were polite respectful and courteous and nothing was too much trouble for them. The food was amazing and enhanced by a wonderful wine selection both on the flights and in the lounges of Perth Manchester and Dubai. As ever the entertainment system was excellent and for the first time I used the on board wifi with ease.
Tel Aviv to Singapore via Istanbul. Ground service is awful I am Elite and get no gold lines. Boarding is a mess. Customer service awful. They deducted miles from my accounts and they dont care give me weird and general answers over the email. Cabin crew was ok but missed several safety classes. I paid for emergency seat Turkish Airlines decided to give to someone else the seat this guy is Turkish Airlines employee I saw him with joking around with the cabin crew and they also treated him with some business class beverages so Turkish Airlines is also corrupted. In Tel Aviv there is no special line for the gold members because Turkish Airlines also doesnt care about the so many Israeli passengers.
Punctual and decent travel experience mostly. Booked wheelchair provided from Cochin to Abu Dhabi from Abu Dhabi refused but from Heathrow given a wheelchair facility. There was water scarcity from the beginning of Abu Dhabi to Heathrow even a 60 old year lady asked multiple times not given.
I have been visiting Malta since 1985 and used several airlines in the early days it was Air Malta but they became to expensive. In 2006 I had a work accident that left me with a disability that I can not climb stairs as not able to bend my left leg and need extra room as need my leg in a semi straight position. I am however quite able to walk around a plane. All other airlines such as Monarch and EasyJet as I have a letter from my consultant supply me with an extra leg room seat free of charge. Not this company. I telephoned direct to pre book extra leg room seats on the plane and was told I had to pay this. I explained no other companies charge the answer was we do. So to stop an argument I paid. What a con they had booked me standard seats not extra leg room and charged me for this I could have booked them myself when we got the boarding passes online. The service on the plane and attitude of the staff towards disabled people was at best poor.
Fly with FM frequently on ShanghaiTaiyuan ShanghaiChangsha and ShanghaiKunming. More or less delayed for 3050 minutes each time. Shanghai Airlines joined Star Alliance in 2007 then Skyteam in 2011 they didnt improved their quality and still stay at the 2starbudget airline standard. Nothing to eat for meal bad quality of drinks for domestic travel China Southern CZ is much better.
My daughter and I were flying to London from Minneapolis and had a long layover in Reykjavik. I wanted to see if there was an upgrade available for purchase so I went to the gate desk. The man behind the counter was doing paperwork looking down at his work. I walked up to the desk and stood there for over 5 minutes. He never acknowledged my presence. Finally I said Good afternoon sir I am wondering... He quickly cut me off and tapped his pen on a sign on their counter that says Rude customers will be removed. Really I walked away completely disgusted. If there was anyone who was rude it was clearly him. The flight was cramped like sardines and there was little to no food even for purchase for this long leg. I decided I would rather paddle a canoe across the Atlantic than fly with Icelandair again. Im tired of airlines acting like we owe them something. We are the customers and yet its a common theme with many airlines that we are treated like beggars and people who are trying to get something for nothing. I wish the FAA or some regulating agency would step in and make mandates so airlines will quit ripping off customers cramming them into tiny spaces you cant get out of in an emergency and treating us like criminals. Yes there are rude customers but most people are just trying to get from point A to point B with a paid ticket. No other industry in the world gets away with such treatment of their customers.
Flew to Cologne from LHR on 29th March 2013 and back on 1st April 2013 and I have to say Germanwings were fantastic. The aircraft was comfortable and the staff friendly and cheerful. We were delayed taking off through no fault of Germanwings but we made up time. On the return journey we took off on time and landed on time. Would definitely fly with Germanwings again.
Kudos to the staff at Singapore Airlines good job at managing customers friendly service highly professional and eager to be of assistance. Helpful polite and well presented I had such a wonderful experience and pleasant flight Food delicious Thank you once again for contributing to my amazing holiday experience.
GIGLHR B773 Newly refurbished cabin. Seats were good and comfortable food was reasonable and entertainment was great HD screen with many options.
Frankfurt to London City. Efficient and polite check in security queues were too long at Frankfurt. Bus transfer from terminal to airfield to board this small plane. Flight significantly delayed due to air traffic control and all passengers had to wait inside the small Embraer 90 which wasnt particularly pleasant. Seats are a bit wider than other BA aircraft. Snack and a variety of drinks were offered by nice cabin attendants. Very long walk from airplane to UK border control greeted with long queues at immigration counters only 1 desk available for nonEU passports. Inefficient baggage reclaim given I still had to wait for my luggage after the long immigration queue.
They loaded all the baggage and then decided they were overweight. They offloaded randomly 30 bags without ever saying a word to the passengers. Those bags never made it on the plane. No concern for the fact that these people had connecting flights or were on their way home and had two or three additional days that they would have no luggage because of their stupidity. Didnt even have the decency to announce that they were going to do it and give people a chance to fly a later flight with their luggage. We always carry our bags on because of stupidity like this but thats not possible on the ATR because the overheads are so small. First time I checked the bag in 10 years and they lost both of our bags.
Toronto to Keflavik. We had a great experience. The service was exactly as described when booking the ticket. The crew members were amazing I have no complaints. They left on time both flights and the return flight arrived 40 min earlier. I bought the promotional tickets to visit Iceland. Overall 55 stars and I would recommend this airline.
Riga to Budapest. A typical semi lowcost airline. The main hub Riga Airport is clean and nice the ground service of the airline is nothing special. The legroom is amazing compared to other lowcost airlines and the cabin is very clean. Meals and drinks are available on purchase the cabin crew served meals and beverages two times during our flight you can preorder your meals too the variety of meals is wide. The cabin crew was very moody the couldnt make even a smile. Our flight was 2 hours 10 minutes long this is the time what is unbearable on a turboprop aircraft. You cannot sleep and relax because of the noise.
London to Izmir via Istanbul. First time Id flown TK. I found them very good in the air cabin crew planes food all very nice. Not so great on the ground ground staff call centre computer systems. My flight from LHR was delayed so I missed the connection in Istanbul. Most ground staff dont speak English and I was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little English. I eventually got on a flight to Izmir three hours later but it wasnt an easy process made worse by the vast distances one has to walk between gates in the cavernous new airport. Also Id phoned a TK call centre based in Ukraine to pay an extra 40 or so each way for extra leg room seats. However as the departure times kept changing my seats kept changing and for the return leg to London from Istanbul I was not given an extra leg room seat. Luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out. Overall I think their cabin crew and planes are very good ground staff and call centre staff need better training and they all need better computer systems and software to work with.
On April 17 2023 I was scheduled on a jetblue flight from Fort Lauderdale to Hartford. About an hour before the approximately 700 flight they announced a delay. They updated it with a further delay until 1010. Around 930 they announced the flight was cancelled. Of course everyone rushed to the jetblue ticket counter. It was chaos. They began announcing and continued to repeat the announcement that they could not get anyone on a flight to the northeast until Friday this was Monday. They repeatedly announced that if you wanted to reschedule not before Friday you should wait in line at the ticket counter. If you wanted a REFUND dont wait in line and call jetblue. I chose the latter. A few days later I phoned jetblue. The agent said there would be no refund but as a courtesy he would give me a travel credit. I recently checked the travel credits and its not there. I contacted jetblue. The agent said she has no record of the credit and anyway there is no credit for flights canceled due to weather. So the agents making the announcement at the FLL airport were lying when they said we could get a refund. The agent who said he would give me a travel credit lied too.
Before my trip to Vietnam I booked with KLM first put on standby for the flight to Paris then also put on standby for Ho Chi Minh then to Hanoi I was not on the passenger list. The flight I was supposed to have was now full. A ticket is no guarantee to actually fly What makes it worse its business as usual so as a passenger you just have to deal with it. Employees were disinterested and even completely unwilling to help at Schiphol. Was stunned that KLMs service level had dropped to this level. Finally got in touch with customer service apologies and the message that I did arrive at destination so thats why they dont apply compensation. They also indicated that it was normal that a flight was overbooked and that you could be placed on standby. Wanted to speak to a manager but they said they would close the case and stop responding to my emails. Horrible start to the holiday and cringeworthy service. Ben voor mijn reis naar Vietnam geboekt bij KLM eerst standby gezet voor de vlucht naar Parijs vervolgens ook standby gezet voor Ho Chi Minh daarna naar Hanoi stond ik niet op de passagierslijst. De vlucht die ik moest hebben zat inmiddels vol. Een ticket is geen garantie om daadwerkelijk te gaan vliegen Wat het erger maakt het is de gewone gang van zaken dus je hebt het er als passagier maar mee te doen. Medewerkers waren ongeinteresseerd en op Schiphol zelfs totaal niet bereid te helpen. Was verbluft dat het serviceniveau van KLM naar dit niveau was gedaald. Uiteindelijk contact gehad met de klantenservice excuses en de boodschap dat ik wel op bestemming was aangekomen dus daarom hanteren ze geen compensatie. Ook gaven ze nog aan dat het normaal was dat een vlucht overbooked was en je standby geplaatst kon worden. Wilde een manager spreken maar ze gaven aan de case te sluiten en niet meer op mijn mails te reageren. Afschuwelijke start van de vakantie en tenenkrommende service.
We arrived to the airport the date of Feb 6 2020 to board our Sunwing flight leaving from Montego Bay to Toronto Our initial flight was scheduled to leave at 350pm and arrive in Toronto at 800pm. As we got there around 200pm we were not notified of any delays as we entered through securitycustoms. I had text and email alerts from Sunwing that NEVER once notified me of any updates and changes. Upon arrival into the terminal we were told our flight was delayed. But no one had a reasoning as to why it was. It was about a 3 hour delay. We waited for the time frame that they posted would be our boarding time to only find out that it was delayed AGAIN Every time we spoke to people they had different answers on the reasoning of this. either the flight we were supposed to be on had to be used for another flight the flight is delayed flying in or the flight was experiencing mechanical issues. Time kept ticking by and as it went over the 3 hour mark where we are supposed to be compensated for this extensive delay with a food voucher the Sunwing staff was incapable of giving us real answers and helping us understand the issues that were occurring. We had to legit BEG for these food vouchers of 15. Whats great about Montego Bay airport Is that the airport officially closes at 500pm. This means no one can leave to reenter security all the restaurants close as all the flights are typically done and out by that timeframe. It was well over 500pm and we were still waiting for food vouchers to be released. We did receive the vouchers until 730800pm By that time nothing was open. We were the only people in the airport. We sat there. Waiting for updates. Absolutely nothing. At 845pm was the first real update on what was going on. The flaps on the plane were defective. They all refused to let us leave the airport to stay a night somewhere and get the next flight in the morning. Their grand idea was to make us wait to arrange an empty plane from Cuba gather last minute staff for that flight and fly to Montego Bay to get us and take us home. Of course you can only imagine how long that would take. Our flight continued to get pushed back more and more 1145pm they promised we would be boarding. Thats over 8 hours waiting in an empty airport with no food they did not provide any water. You can only imagine the amount of families and older aged people on the plane who had to sit around for this time frame with little to no updates and zero care.. During this long and dreadful wait there were patrons on our plane who got into their duty free purchases. One gentlemen was extremely intoxicated by 1145pm. Dancing around singing to the top of his lungs causing nonsense disturbing peoples space. Of course no one was around to monitor his behaviour except the other drunk friends he was with. As we were boarding the plane after midnight I had let the flight attendants of the his extremely intoxicated behaviour. Which mind you is extremely illegal to board a plane when you are this drunk. They thanked me for letting them know of this occurrence and proceeded to let him on the flight I wish they would have even taken initiative to at least talk to him about his behaviour as it was extremely disrespectful to the other patrons on the flight that had to deal with him the rest of the way home. We were supposed to be home at 800pm on Feb 6 and did not get into Toronto until Feb 7 at 530am
Cancelled the ticket 45 days ago. I have been talking to customer service since my cancellation date they confirmed it from the very first day. Now when I call they tell me that they had a technical glitch and I have to wait another 45 days for it to be processed. They will not send any confirmation email. The representative was sarcastic and said he cannot help. When I explained to them and asked why the other 10 representatives before them spoke differently and promised it would be refunded. Very shady. Never ever book with Etihad airways. We booked a choice plus flight ticket as our trip plan was volatile. Even after paying extra money for a flexible ticket the worst experience. Please do not book with them if you want to make changes for your ticket. Very shady airline I cannot stress enough. I have recorded voice calls and saved chat conversations which I can submit to prove my point. You can check the confirmation they sent in the endorsement part of the ticket.
Ponta Delgada to Lisbon. Do not trust this airline. My husband and I booked our trip to the Azores from there we booked a flight from the Azores to Lisbon Portugal. We booked our flight with SATA airlines. We arrived at the airport to catch our flight to Lisbon only to receive an SMS text saying our flight was cancelled and we were being put on a flight 7 hours later than. Not only did they put us on the last flight of the day to Lisbon but they wouldnt even put us on any waiting lists for earlier flights. We lost a day of our vacation thanks to SATA. Do not book or put your trust in them.
I found the economy seating to be comfortable however they separate travellers who have not paid for seats which only led to passengers swapping seats before take off. I hadnt expected a meal but received a very good quality meal with water and coffee. Staff were busy yet polite and the whole flight was enjoyable. On return however half the passengers had a coughing bug the plane was not clean and children had been separated from their parents which led to more shuffling. The food on this leg was inedible. The worst thing was that there was no water provided and passengers had no opportunity to buy water as there were no facilities after passport control in Luxor. I still think this is a good airline as long as youre not bothered where you sit so would probably use them again
I bought an Alitalia ticket and I called and confirmed with Alitalia customer service that economy tickets included a checked bag. The customer service representative confirmed that I had a checked bag. When I arrived at the airport they refused to check my bag unless I paid 60 each way. Obviously it was too late at that point to pack a carryon so I was forced to pay an extra 240 dollars 120 round trip for myself and my boyfriend for our bags. They told me I had a light ticket but it didnt say that on my ticket. They said that economy tickets included a bag but light tickets did not. Alitalia overcharged us for the bags. I contacted them after the incident on September 20 2019 and the automated email noted that they would respond to us within 30 days. Its now 46 days later and Im still waiting for a resolution.
Davao to Singapore. SilkAir used to be a great little airline with good seat pitch quality service and foodbeverage options. Now I struggle to differentiate it from the low cost carriers. The only value proposition I see now for Silk air is connectivity to Singapore Airlines. Seat pitch seems little different to Cebu Pacific request a beer and you get it poured half full into a small plastic cup with no refill offer. Food is bland and quantities reduced. I have flown this route periodically for 20 years and have gone from being a devotee of Silk Air to wondering why bother for the dollars paid.
Fantastic flight. Despite a delay departing Narita due to weather I really enjoyed my flight on Air Calin. The crew were fantastic very friendly and helpful. Excellent onboard service great food a very comfortable seat and the cabin was clean. I would fly them again.
My partner and I spent Christmas in Tokyo. The flight over was enjoyable the staff were polite and helpful and it all ran smoothly. Our experience back home was completely different. The staff were incredibly rude and lazy. The flight was 12 hours and mid flight my partner asked for a bottle of water. The lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself. My partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from. Both our TVs stopped working mid flight also for a period of 40 minutes. We asked the staff if they could fix the problem. The lady said she would try while sighing. As 25 year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to I can tell you British Airways will not be it. Terrible customer service.
Airport used was the old Manila Domestic Airport dubbed the Terminal 4 and confuses you of a newer terminal but in fact its an old terminal with no jetbridges and there is very poor ventilation. Zest Air is a disaster for Air Asia because it cannot be a part of the best budget airline in the world. Their airport staff in Manila are not friendly. Seat of your choice cost PhP100 even on checkin which is freeofcharge on other airlines. Their aircrafts are old and the painting is filthy dirty and the seat covers are torn and dirty. The cabin smells and the air conditioning is very poor. The plane I was on had several defective lights throughout the cabin making it darker. The flight attendants were friendly though but still the whole experience was a nightmare. I will never fly this airline again.
Flew Cathay after a long time excellent inflight service great entertainment and food options. Was very impressed with the cabin crew efforts to attend to everyones needs and maintaining a courteous professional service with a smile. The only thing I felt that needs improvement is the leg space in Economy the seats are cramped close to each other and seem to be smaller felt like there was more seats vs other airlines who use the 777.
Birmingham to Fuerteventura. Flight was delayed for nearly 4 hours we were boarded onto an aircraft that had flown in with a known fault so we sat in our seats with technicians running around for 1.5 hours we were then disembarked given a 5 voucher and sent back to departures. Another aircraft was flown in and we finally departed at about 18.00 hours original departure time should have been 14.15 arrived at destination airport 22.00 getting to hotel at 23.00. I had spent nearly an hour on the phone at Birmingham ringing the transfer company and hotel with updates as departure times kept changing. We paid for priority boarding that didnt happen on boarding either planes when I queried this one of the cabin crew I was told not to ask we expected to arrive mid evening relax have a nice meal and start our holiday instead we arrived absolutely shattered and went straight to bed. There was a lack of information we were herded around like cattle we should never have been boarded onto an aircraft with a known fault.
Istanbul to Sydney via Singapore. First time I had flown Singapore Airlines in over 25 years and I had very high expectations. First impression was that the interior looked clean but slightly dated. The seats were comfortable but the armrests didnt come all the way up which was annoying. Had 3 seats to myself on one flight but couldnt stretchsleep due to the arms rests. Legroom was above average at 32 inches and much appreciated. The individual TV was very old and screen quality was poor. The cheap headphones meant that the sound was fuzzy and after 30 mins I gave up. This was the case on all 4 long haul flights. Very disappointing. Selection was average. Compared to Emirates or Turkish Airlines it was remarkably bad. Even the moving map was ancient. Needs massive improvement. Service was excellent through the flight. Crew very polite and proactive. Food drinks were generally good. Asian dishes were excellent and they gave me a second hot meal on request. Icecream for dessert was fun. Snacks were also provided as were drinks between meals. Steel cutlery was appreciated. Hot towel service is excellent. Toilets were always kept clean with nice amenities. They were also larger than on other airlines. All in all I was really looking forward to a 5 Star experience but the PTV really let me down. Ruined the flight given I had over 38 hours flying time on this trip and had been really looking forward to seeing some movies tv etc. With the new economy seats Singapore Airlines will be a 5 star product but without them they are barely 3.5.
Gladstone to Brisbane. I booked this flight through Virgin Australia website. But later I found out that Virgin ceased his service for some cities and gave it over to a new commercial airline called Alliance Airlines. The aircraft was a Fokker 70 with old interior look. The legroom was very tight. The airlines magazine was the only entertainment on board which hadnt been prepared tastefully. On the positive side the crew were the most friendly cabin crew Ive seen in Australian airlines. The complimentary snack it was a 730am flight was better than what Virgin used to offer. However the only drink available was water. It is expected for an airline to offer coffee and tea in the morning at least they can sell a few options on board. The flight time was shorter than usual as it wasnt a propeller aircraft. Handling at both airport was done by Virgin Australia so it wasnt really related to this review. Generally its good that a new competitor is entering the market. As a beginner in this sector they seem to be doing acceptable job. But they should improve some issues to become a rival to other airlines in regional Australia.
Vancouver to Hong Kong. Very bad experience with the Inflight Service. I travelled with my husband and 8 month old daughter from Vancouver to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific for almost 12 hours. In the middle of the long flight a turbulence occurred and the seatbelt sign came on. So I grabbed my baby and held her on my lap then put on my seatbelt as i could not find the baby seatbelt that the flight attendants have provided earlier. One of the flight attendants came to check on us if our seatbelts were buckled and asked me if they offered the baby seatbelt to which i said yes but i could not find it so i will just look for it later after the turbulence. FA then freaked out and raised her voice saying what do you mean you cant find it You have to find it now Then turned on the overhead light disregarding my sleeping baby then shoved my right shoulder away from the back of my seat so she can take a look and try to find the baby seatbelt. Knowing that she wont stop harassing me and my baby I woke my husband and asked for his help. When he saw how the FA was treating me and my baby even he got surprised and blurted out whoa whoa whoa Ill take care of them myself. To which the FA said she just did not want to wake the baby. A totally contradicting statement to what she was doing just minutes ago. I filed a complaint to their Customer Relations Department and got a response through email saying that they understand how annoying the situation must have been for me and that they have shared my letter with the Inflight Services Manager so that they can follow up with the staff members in question. They do not care about the experience of their customers and they have rude Flight Attendants.
I would like to offer my profound thanks to all Rex ground staff and our flight attendant for making my day of retirement so overwhelming. I have been travelling to Whyalla to work as a diagnostic sonographer for many years and I travelled back to Adelaide from Whyalla for the last time two weeks ago. The Sunday prior on my arrival in Whyalla Gavin met me at the airport and gave me the most exquisite gift of some miniature origami pieces he had made himself a gift that moved me to tears. On the following Friday on my departure for Adelaide most of the Rex ground staff were there to farewell me with hugs and a very moving card. When I boarded the plane Claudio indicated my seat which was festooned with a farewell sign and a bottle of wine After giving his safety briefing Claudio announced to the passengers that I was retiring and when he came with drinksnack service I was presented with my own special cake These wonderful people have looked after me for so many years and I consider myself so lucky to have known them.
I flew round trip from Davao City to Cebu. On the flight to Cebu I had my dive gear in an Akona Bag and was going to carryon my regulator. They stopped me at Xray and told me I could not carry on a regulator so I had to go down a check it in as a checked bag. Coming back from Cebu. I prepaid for 25 kilos for my dive gear but did not tell them its sports equipment. So when I checked the Akona bag in they said its sports equipment and I would have to pay between p30005000. They said I cannot put clothes in with sports equipment. I only had that bag and a carryon back pack for me and my girlfriend. They said I have to take the clothes out and put them in a separate bag which I did not have. He called his supervisor and let me get away with the way I had it this one time only.
San Francisco to Dhaka via Singapore. Very poor online and customer service. I had a hard time selecting seats online even though I paid for seat selection. I had to call customer service 7 times to get my seats. Even after paying and calling 7 times the selected seats never showed up on itinerary or booking making me worry util I check in and board the plane.
London to Dushanbe via Astana and Almaty. 2.5 hrs delay at Heathrow due to broken brakes. No TVs chargers or AC on the very old plane. Due to the delay I missed my connection and am stuck in Almaty for 2 nights which I assumed Air Astana were paying for but the hotel theyve just put me up in have just come and asked for payment. Total shambles. Never flying with them if I can avoid it. Staff all very friendly and helpful.
East London to Cape Town with FlySafair. The inflight service was absolutely abominable. The air hostesses went down the aisle once then closed the service for stocktake for the rest of the flight. That is poor management stocktake should happen after the plane has landed and the passengers have disembarked. Also they did not come and remove the rubbish and asked the passengers to clean up themselves. We were asked to place the rubbish in the seat pocket. So we were very disgusted with the service I believe that that is a management issue and that needs to be addressed promptly.
No vegetarian options in the Sakura lounge. When requested we have run out of options. Booked Jain meal for parents. They only have request for one sector. Tokyo to Bangalore and not for SFO to Tokyo. The rule is book 24 hours in advance. Who would book only one sector we book business class to get personalised attention and care. The seats are good and comfortable. I might still travel JAL for my own logistics reasons of timings etc but not because I felt good with the airline.
Very good flight between Cape Town and Doha. Quiet and comfortable A350 with the usual high standard service. The difference for the 2nd flight could not be greater. Qatar changed the aircraft from a 773 to an A320. Stepping into the business class cabin was like going back to the 80s very uncomfortable small non lieflat seats with a small unresponsive in armrest video screen. This type of business class product is not appropriate for a 4 hour flight to Ankara. It was probably the worst Business Class flight I had.
This experience has been truly terrible. First Turkish Airlines changed the date of my return flight twice necessitating me changing plans twice. Then my outbound flight was cancelled with 16 hours notice. I am currently trying to get a refund for this after having bought an expensive one way lastminute alternative. I cannot get through to customer services and have received an email that the deadline is in 2 days. Abysmal service avoid this airline.
Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was not up to the mark at all.
Amman to Kuala Lumpur via Bangkok. Service and food on my flight to Kuala Lumpur via Bangkok was ok. I could stay in the airplane during fuelling which was good. The only disturbing thing was the dimmable windows. They were just locked into darkness for the whole flight. Theres a reason why I chose a window seat so please let passengers enjoy the view sunrise and sunset
I booked my flight three month in advance. My flight got delayed for two hours causing me to miss my last flight to the final destination. Both flights were Austrian Airlines. I received a hotel voucher but this does not change the fact that I missed a very important day. They rebooked me automatically and in the end I have to take two more flights.
NH00O6 departs from Tokyo around 4.30pm and arrives at Tom Bradley in LAX at 11.30 aprox. The arrival time is great since immigration counters are not that busy at that particular time. Seats are comfortable maybe not as great as business but still ok for this long flight. I wish the footrest would elevate more. Althought the pitch between seats is bigger than in plain economy they affect the space of the passenger behind when recline. The food had two nice choices and the selection of wines was very good. Service with ANA is great so nothing to complain about. Ground service in Tokyo as well in LAX was very good. Baggage was delivered without delay. Ask for baggage check through if traveling in another Star Alliance carrier even you dont have the other leg of your trip in the same ticket. Flight entertainment could be better.
Singapore to Jakarta route 12 times a month for 8 years. Compared to the competition for the same route Singapore Airlines provides the biggest plane AF used to serve the same route with their big plane but this ceased 2 years ago with Garuda only providing 2 big planes for this route day. The big plane factor here matters as the smaller planes tend to be parked away from the terminal and thus the passenger has to take a bus to the main terminal. Bigger planes almost always gets the aerobridge and thus the disembarkation process is way faster. For this 1.5 hour flight Singapore Airlines provides a meal and also their fullservice competition and the speed of service for the food is amazing. The selection of food is pretty good however the selection for special diets have to be made online in advance. No connectivity on the flight. Leg space is pretty good compared to their competition however the price for this route is pretty high can be as high as a price from SIN to NRT on low season for example.
Milan Bergamo to Lviv via Timisoara. Flight due to leave at 11.30 a.m. checkin started 2.5 hours before departure. 20 mins after take off we were served lunch and the chance to have some wine. After 1h 50minutes we landed in Timisoara after 1 hour we were boarded on the flight to Lviv the aircraft was another Saab 2000 the flight attendants were again smiling and professional but this time we were served only a snack with beverages. Lviv airport looks like a Museum a small Opera House inside a lot of Soviet Fresco paintings on the walls no bars but only a self service snack point no boarding gate but a small departure area divided from the apron by a small door. Again the aircraft was a saab 2000 and the 2 flight attendants were helpful this time we had hot breakfast flight landed on time at Timisoara then after another hour we took off to Bergamo.
Flew last week from Munich to Tyunmen TJM Siberia. B735 with Europeanstyle business cabin middle seat free. Smooth checkin my coat was taken by a smiling attendant but no help to put my 8kg luggage in the locker. No entertainment during the 5 12 hours journey redeye but more than decent meal with appetisers and good Chilean wine. I hope that my return flight in two days will be at least as peaceful although the linguistic capacities of the crew should be improved.
Prague to Helsinki. Had to pay 45 eur for 20x20 cm bag at the gate because it was additional item to a cabin sized small suitcase. Handbag had to either be put in suitcase which was full or pay 45 eur.
Im not one to leave reviews but feel the need to warn people away from this airline. As someone who travels domestically and internationally very regularly I was surprised at the poor customer service and gotcha approach with flight changes. I made an error with booking interisland transit and within 15 minutes tried to change it only to be told that customer service was unwilling to do so based on the fare rules. mind you it was a first class ticket that had been changed once to this new island and by accident I got the wrong airport. This was disappointing and frustrating and from my experience not in line with industry standards for any other American or international carrier I have used aside from deeply discounted budget brands. Do yourself a favor and avoid this airline. You dont want to be in my situation where an error caught in 15 minutes means you forfeit your . So many other airlines fly to Hawaii and actually have some basic standards of customer service. The money grab really feels inconsistent with the beautiful culture of Hawaii. How disappointing.
They changed the time on the flight from early morning to afternoon. When we arrived the flight was delayed three different times finally our plane we were supposed to fly on was ready but we were informed our bags had been mistakenly sent to another state on a different plane. So we boarded the plane and sat for another 45 minutes before we were told the plane had another mechanical issue and we would have to deplane. We are now waiting for another to aircraft to come get us.... Supposedly the silver lining is that our bags are being sent back from Georgia to Connecticut and before we takeoff will be loaded onto this point. No matter how the story ends I will be avoiding this airline in the future. While the staff is polite they certainly are not very well trained and this day has been a complete waste.
Toronto to Montreal. I have a hearing disability and after a miscommunication and missed flight which happens often for me no fault of anyones the extent that the staff went to after understanding my hearing disability was incredible. An agent collected me from the restaurant and brought me to the boarding gate was personable and relatable most importantly authentic. I truly felt appreciated. Even as I was sat in my seat I was offered water Jessica and Bianca I believe treated me like I mattered and I have never found that elsewhere. Im so grateful to get home later than I hoped but have this experience in exchange. Customer service that other airlines simply dont have.
Copenhagen to Sorvagur return. Wonderful experience many smiles by service team multiple drink refills decent inflight entertainment via own device and very smooth flight into Faroer. An excellent value for money and perhaps one of the last remaining airlines in Europe that treats customers as many did in the past. I got the impression that the team liked their job and were happy to welcome everyone on board. We preordered delicious snacks and very comfortable seats. Flights were on time and a breeze a perfect start into the vacation and back home.
I booked 2 tickets for Amsterdam to Florence for September 2011. I read that Meridiana stopped this route by March 28th 2001. Trying to reach Meridiana by telephone is impossible. Either they hang up the phone or they dont pick up the phone. Emails are not answered. I dont know if this unfriendly company will pay back or not. Never book with this unreliable airline company
This is the worst airline ever. First you cant check yourself in at a kiosk you have to go to the desk line. If you wish to print your boarding pass you have to pay them to do it 25 dollars to print a boarding pass. Then the agents are all rude and unprofessional. When at my gate trying to board after the desk agent had said you can bring a backpack or purse on without paying I had to pay 99 dollars for my backpack. This airline doesnt care about their customers. This is the first and last time I will ever fly frontier. With the money I had to spend in extra fees I couldve booked a better airline with better customer service planes and overall attitude. Its truly disgusting how this airline operates.
This airline is an absolute nightmare. I do not recommend it to anyone. If you get a hold of customer service every single representative will have a different answer for you. I called to ask about changes to a flight for my husband and I together. I only wanted to know the cost before booking. In the process the representative booked my husbands flight for a different date without permission. The call then dropped and I had no idea he did this. I waited for the representative to call back and he did not. I called back and told them my ticket number to find out your husbands flight has been booked for July 6th now I was shocked. I told them that I did not make this change and they told me to put in a feedback form complaint. For which I have not heard back. I told them I do not want the change. We want to fly together as per the July 10th flight. They made us pay more just to change the flight back to the original. If I did not pay within 72 hours they would cancel his flight and there would be no refund no nothing. This airline is so lost its unbelievable. Theyre all on different pages. Every time I call to get any kind of information they all give me different answers Every time you call it is like a lottery system you never know what the response will be. One person will tell you You can change your flight for 3 dollars while another person will say The flight change will be 300 dollars. One person will say Fully refundable you get all your money back another will say Penalty on each ticket. One person will say Refund will process on to your card in 1 week. Another person will say The refund will be only in cash and will take 23 months and you have to pick up. How will I pick up if I am leaving the country Nothing adds up with this terrible company. I advise you to stay away. We are cancelling both my husband and my ticket although we will lose money just so we will not have to fly with this airline. We are even cancelling our Istanbul trip as I cannot stand traveling with these people or dealing with them anymore.
I had a pleasant experience on my Teheran Mehrabad to Shiraz flight. It was a little bumpy due to weather but a delicious packed snack and drink were served for the short flight. All the crew were very friendly and are a credit to their airline. The A320 EPIEG was clean with a decent seat pitch for my 6 foot frame and I was given a row of seats to myself. All in all a very nice company who charged a very reasonable 53 for my one way ticket. I wish Iran Air the very best with each new addition to their expanding fleet and this wont be the last time I fly Iran Air.
The boarding the seat legroom the staff the food the service the cleanness are all 1010. The only area for improvement is the entertainment the movie selections.
SOUJER return. As my 2008 review Blue Islands has standards that other airlines would do well to emulate clear and inclusive pricing flexibility easy checkin punctual lounges for the use of all passengers at least on the Channel Islands. You are treated as a person it is goodfun travelling not a comment one can make often these days.
Air Niugini planes in good condition decent staff and good pilots. The food on the international 767 was good and the seats have good IFE but a limited movie selection. It breaks down a bit on domestic flights though. The planes Dash8s and Fokker 70s and pilots are still good and inflight service OK although youll only get 2 small cookies and a small juice container finding plain water in PNG is bizarrely difficult however ground service is pretty bad. Port Moresby checkin is a madhouse and locals check huge amounts of baggage note that the free amounts are small 5kg carryon and 16kg checked although if youre connecting from international they will usually allow whatever allowance you had for that flight which means that late arrivals are often bumped due to the plane hitting the weight limit so check in early And then hope that your luggage actually arrives Ive already had misdirected luggage on my 4th flight in PNG. The weather contributes to frequent delays and cancellations and the handling of rebookings is poor. Still much better than most domestic flight experiences that Ive had in countries like this. Overall score of 7 considers an 8 for international and a 4 for domestic.
LisbonTunisLisbon. Good plane comfortable seats food okay cabin crew not very smiley but do the job. Outbound with delay of 3h30m with no explanation neither in the airport nor onboard. We were forced to wait next to the boarding gate but we were served a sandwich and drink of our choice. The flight was okay a new and clean Airbus onboard crew okay. Overall classification acceptable.
Kuala Lumpur to Chicago via Tokyo. Overall it was a highly pleasant experience with the ground staff air crew and service provided by the airline. Flight from KUL to NRT left and arrived on time. Flight from NRT to IAD also left and arrived on time but we were left waiting for about 20 minutes on the tarmac at IAD as there was another aircraft at our gate. Ground staff were quite efficient and courteous for our check in at KUL. Both flights passengers were provided with plenty of food snacks and drinks. Food served was always hot and was quite tasty. The flight attendants were attentive and were quick to appear when called upon. Only slight complaint is most of the attendants did not really communicate well in English and were hard to understand. Lavatories were cleaned throughout all flights. Seats on the B789 were quite hard but the B773 were older but much more comfortable. This is the second time Ive chosen to fly with them to North America and will continue to use them again in future as they are quite value for money in comparison to other Asian airlines.
Air Malawi brands its self as Africas friendly airline I live in Kenya and my mother was coming from the UK to Blantyre via Nairobi. She was booked on a Saturday flight to Blantyre via Lilongwe from Nairobi. On the Friday we found that Air Malawi had cancelled the flight without thinking to tell us. When I contacted them they said there was a flight on the Monday but it was full so they rebooked her for the Wednesday flight. As she was going to Malawi for 2 weeks this would have made her trip very short. Finally I managed to get her on the monday flight. Air Malawi have two scheduled flights a week from Nairobi to Lilongwe. Monday and Friday. But they book people for all seven days of the week. If enough people book they fly if they dont they cancel the flight. The thing that really annoyed me was that I chose to use Air Malawi because they told me they fly every day. If I had known the truth I would have used Kenya Airways who admit they have only two flights a week. The second thing that annoyed me was that there was not even a hint of an apology from them for cancelling the flight. If you are trying to go to Malawi my advice is to use Kenya Airways. They are more expensive but they will get you there when they say you will and if they cant at least they will say sorry
I am not completely satisfied with my recent experience with Saudi Airlines even though I hold Alfursan Silver Elite SkyTeam membership. Unfortunately the service quality has decreased significantly in the recent period. Through several trips I noticed a big difference in terms of guest care when calling the customer service centre you will wait for no less than 30 minutes even when you were holding the premium membership and most of the employees if you reach them will not solve your request or make it complicated and not initiating the service. The quality of food on board has deteriorated even to the business class and not only to the economy class and also the fulfilment of requests by ground staff or flight attendant mostly average to bad and I noticed a lack of flight performance to leave or arrive on time in several flights and also even a large increase in prices and in return without good service I used to choose Saudi Airlines previously for several reasons including the special membership that I carry which gives me many wonderful services beside the average to good service and reasonable prices but now I will make this company my third or maybe fourth choice even if my membership is reduced it does not matter much.
I was a passenger on a flight OS 0392 Barcelona Vienna and I had a ticket that included a connecting flight to Sarajevo OS 0757. The flights were booked together in one single ticket. The takeoff of the flight from Barcelona was delayed and we got late to our transfer flight from Vienna to Sarajevo which was scheduled at 1255 pm together with the other 7 passengers. During the flight we were told to go to gate G36 as quickly as possible so I ran first because I have the EU passport so I can tell them to wait for my colleagues who have non EU passport. I arrived first and there was 7 minutes until the take off but we were denied boarding even though there would be enough time for us to enter the plane. We were told to go to G4 to get our flight rebooked and it was rebooked to all of us. I noticed that for the other transfer flights the staff from Vienna airport were waiting for the passengers and directed them to the gate. I dont know and cant understand why that wasnt a case for us because that would help us to make it on time. The passengers of different flights should have the same conditions so they can enjoy the same rights. According to EU REGULATION EC 261 I have the right to claim a compensation of 250 euros and I will definitely ask for that. In addition 10 euros isnt enough for a daily meal and a drink at Vienna airport because of the high prices. Also when I picked my suitcase at Sarajevo Airport a wheel was missing and since I didnt report it at the airport they refused to give me any kind of reimbursement.
Worst experience Ive ever had. They lost one of my bags and damaged my other bag Ive been without my things for 3 days now and they have not stayed in proper contact with me and told me on my second day they could not deliver it after 12 and they would deliver it to me on the 3rd day but I still havent received any information or my bag. They also wont take any responsibility for the broken bag they ripped my zipper right off and now the bag is not usable and I need to replace it with my own money. I also asked to go pick my bag up from the airport myself and they havent given me the option to do that even tho the lady that assisted me at the airport said I would be able to. This is my first time and last time flying with them.
I make a round trip flight to South America at least 2x per year. When AC Rouge first started I loved flying with them. Then they upgraded their planes with thinner seats and less recline unfortunately most airlines have made this upgrade. I find it rather ironic that they did this when every study on air rage shows that more comfort aka more leg room and seat recline reduces stress and air rage. So they did the exact opposite of what every study said they should do. So not only have they made a long haul flight less comfort able the prices have also been steadily creeping upwards I used to buy first class for what you now pay in premium economy. As a whole the cabin crew has always been great to me but you always get the odd one who may be having a bad day and are a bit more abrasive. When Rouge first started flying I never had an issue with missing or delayed baggage. The last 4 flights I have had missingdelayed bags. In summery AC Rouge is a typical low cost carrier that cuts costs where they can. They used to be exceptional but now they are below average.
Chiang MaiLuang Prabang. Flight departed on time. Smooth ride for a propjet. Served an odd but somewhat tasty snack on the short flight. Back of plane appears to be Economy as there was an undrawn curtain between areas and the seats in the back are cloth instead of leather. Otherwise the seat size and pitch are exactly the same in both areas. Economy seats exit the plane first so its difficult to see the advantage of business seating if thats what it was. Friendly efficient flight attendants able to whip out meal and beverage service on a 30 mins flight.
Flew Singapore to Hanoi with SilkAir. Transited through Singapore so no check in. Boarding was efficient. Cabin staff were very helpful in stowing hand luggage in overheads. Flight left on time. Seat was comfortable for a short flight. Meal served was good. Cabin staff had limited English but did their best to be helpful.
New York to Montego Bay. I bought a 2 way ticket on Caribbean Airlines. Before my return trip I received an email from the airline saying that my flight was cancelled and I was reaccommodated on a flight the following day. I was not able to travel on the date they gave me so I called more than a week before the given date to find out my options. The representative on the phone was rude and unwilling to help. She said I had to pay a rebooking fee plus the difference to get on a new flight with the same airline. I was not advised that I could place that ticket on hold for future use or that I could receive a refund as my flight being cancelled happened on the airlines part certainly not mine. I received no refund and no credit either. I had to buy a new return ticket because of Caribbean Airlines customer service representative negligence due to inadequate customer service training of the airlines staff.
9615 GRRORD CRJ700 First Class seat 1A. Booked with BA Avios Points. Short flight to get to Chicago to connect to BA flight home. Welcomed onboard and offered a Pre Departure Drink. Seat was comfortable with plenty of Room. Crew were great and offered a drink and a snack on this short 30 min flight.
Gran Canaria Valencia return. Checked in online in both directions and only had to drop my luggage at the counter. Almost full CRJ 200 and must admit that it was a pleasure to fly with this airline. Comfortable leather seats emergency exit seat so plenty of legroom for a 64 passenger like me also noticed that the other rows of seats also had above average space although the seats were a bit narrow due to the width of the plane rather than Air Nostrum seating. The two flight attendants were cheerful and helpful a sandwich and beer was provided more than adequate for the time of day and length of flight 2h30m. Infinitely better flight than Iberia via Madrid Air Nostrum will be my airlibne of preference for domestic flights in Spain.
Considering it is a supposed to be a national full service airline it really feels behind. Several times during our vacation they would have delays or misrepresent them by having technical landings only informing us days before our flight with no service or compensation of course. Cabins themselves are quite cold and uncomfortable again not usually an issue for budget carriers but this is supposed to be a national airline. Two bright spots would be that the in flight staff really try their best and the routes from MNL to the United States are by far the cheapest available.
Flew British Airways business class from London Heathrow to Santorini. The seats are a joke and in reality are economy seats sold as a business class package. No leg room and BA attempt to improve the experience by blocking the middle seat for a 2x2 configuration AC and DE. The problem is they use an upended tray which is bolted into the seat and cannot be moved. At least If the middle seat was vacant couples could stretch across and free up some much needed space. Our flight was delayed by a hour traveling out and so we were stuck in our seats for almost five hours. Flight was full in business 9 rows taken up and quickly became stuffy. Since this is an economy seat at a business price it is almost impossible to work out BAs business strategy. Will not fly on this leg again with BA and will take my custom to an alternate airline.
Beijing to Tijuana. The business class service offered by Hainan Airlines is top tier. Each and every detail is paid attention by the crew members and the passengers are taken good care of from taking off to landing. I would recommend it with no hesitations.
Flight to Curacao in economy class. I never had such a bad flight with unfriendly staff. The one free meal was bad for the rest you have to pay. Seat was very narrow. For menever again with Arkefly.
Chengdu to Kunming. 2 minutes to check in and 15 minutes early departure which makes a change when compared to anywhere else where the 30minutedelay is near obligatory. Bags waiting by the time I reached the carousel but beware the lengthy walk at Kunming.
Phuket Air on the 25th March 2005 to a lovely holiday in Thailand. What turned out to be a nightmare was the return flight from Bangkok to Gatwick on the 9th April 2005. On arrival at Bangkok airport on the 26th March 2005 we were handed a sheet of paper and told to ring the number given 72hours before the flight was due to take off to reconfirm the flight and times. We took the flight tickets to an agent and ask if he would do the necessary for which he did it cost 200 baht to get this done we were told that all was in order and was even given a reference number which turned out to be totally ficticous. On arrival at Bangkok airport everything was total chaos as the flight had been cancelled but there was no one from Phuket Air to give any information out to us we were left to roam the airport ourselves to see if we could find anyone that knew anything about the cancelled flight. After several hours we were told that there was a bus waiting outside to take us to a hotel but once outside more chaos as we got on the bus with our luggage we were told that we would have to wait until the bus was full then it could leave. We waited and waited and waited two hours we sat on that bus even the police moved it on as it was there too long. We finally set off only to go round the ring road back to the airport. Still not a word from anyone at Phuket Air. Trying to phone Phuket Air but no answer or engaged. Trying to get home from Bangkok airport flying Phuket air since 9th April 2005 finally got home 14th April 2005. Anyone thinking of flying Phuket air should think again and go by a decent airline as Phuket air doesnt seem to care about it passengers just the money it can get from them.
Leaving from San Jose to Panama City my flight was delayed. There was much confusion and delay in updating the screens of letting the passengers know they didnt have any satisfying or complete answers concerning any of us being able to get help in Panama with our missed layover to LAX. The flight crew in the cabin did admirably and only gave other passengers seemingly trivial problems. From Panama City to LAX we had to wait hours after flying in to Panama before even knowing if wed have flights or where people would be going before reaching their destination. The ground service was laughable it was one man trying his best albeit not even close to being able to handle the situation with another service member focused on the next flight for the area sometimes both of them were preoccupied with making announcements or just repeating details to passengers instead of helping us with our issue of being delayed take that as you will. Others were upset that they would not even adhere to their policies and just intended to let people out to dry due to delays. They were not taking any responsibility for the situation would not put people up in hotels anymore or give them shuttles or any similar accommodation because as I was told this was ceased since Covid and thats part of their new restrictions Allow people to just congest the airport due to delays while also having all over the airport you cant sit or lay down on carpet due to Covid Safety Guidelines It was so contradicting and beyond that they charged for wifi past 30m unless you paid to stay in an overpriced lounge for 8 hours that I heard from a lady you couldnt even sleep in and theyd keep waking you up to prevent it. Those last two parts are more on the airport than airline but the entire thing was a grossly obvious shakedown. Copa is just aiding and abetting by stranding passengers there instead of helping them. All that being considered after waiting for hours I talked to a man that while he gave me questionable reasons for why they couldnt do much and arent responsible nor had anything else to do than the bare minimum I was not worried about these other issues as much I was quite happy he was able to give me a boarding pass for the following morning for my next 2 connections I was going from SJO to Panama City to LAX and had my last layover there before finally one additional flight that was with another airline fortunately and he checked all the other flights at my behest to see if I could find something faster or more reasonable. There wasnt but I appreciated the effort and in the SPECIFIC time frame I was talking to him the speed of getting me what I needed and answering my questions though I was prepared. All in all they acted in a way that the idea of a delay was foreign to them they didnt have any standard procedures to handle it they had NO sufficient answers and generally no answers to your questions unless you knew what to ask. Be it about luggage flights where to stay or what to do. They gave no thought to our situation besides getting us on the next available flight. In my case I had been up for a very long time and was hellbent on getting to the US so I didnt have much in terms of complaints and found the bare minimum acceptable in my case but I sympathized with all the others that got completely fd over. Neve rmind reviews cant contain profanity in effort to censor opinions Avoid if you can at all reasonable costs.
London Gatwick to Dubai return. The Emirates A380 is huge quiet and with a brilliant inflight entertainment system only let down by the headphones. So my advice is but a two pin adaptor and wear your owns to get the full benefit. But thats where it ends. On both the outbound and return legs the inflight service was terrible. Slow to the point of lazy a choice of menu thats undeliverable by the time theyve reached the middle of the flight staff who offer little by the way of a solution when asked whats possible and disinterested in passenger comfort. I had to wait 40 minutes for a meal to be offered to me after I asked for a different main course to what was available in the trolley and then it was the same meal I had declined. I asked to speak to the cabin manager twice who finally arrived 10 mins later to apologize. On the return flight the experience was much the same. No choice of menu for over half the passengers two hours into flight before offered a drink and my meal arrived 50 minutes after my wifes vegetarian choice was offered to her. This was labelled Vegan which isnt what was ordered and then another 10 minutes debate occurred with the cabin crew who said that there was nothing else available unless she wanted to wait until the end of service to see what was left. When I was finally presented with the remaining meal choice chicken with olive sauce I had to ask for a drink and the steward said the drinks trolley was on its way it was half the length of the plane away Somehow other passengers were given drinks with their meals but we at the back were treated as an after thought. The passengers behind us had exactly the same experience. A note of advice for Emirates. Olives are a divisive ingredient people either like or dislike olives so if you include a meal with olives more people will avoid it than choose it Leaving you short of choice The overhead luggage cabin had crew luggage which they proceeded to access a number of times during the flight constantly bumping my head as they reached up. On one occasion the stewardess walked off and left it open for 10 minutes before coming back to close it. So my overriding impression of the airline is that it needs to improve quality of service on a human level. Its all very well having the latest aeroplane but if passenger experience is based on whats on tv and food and drink service is a secondary concern I for one wont fly with them again.
Khartoum to El Fashir the capital of North Darfur in the Sudan the 1hr 20 minute flight departed and arrived on time. Polite crew who patiently showed people to their seats. Two bread rolls one with cheese the other with chicken a cake water soft drink followed by tea and coffee was provided. This is more than BA can provide on their domestic or European routes so if Badr airlines can provide it in Sudan on a domestic flight to Darfur why cant BA Overall a great flight and experience.
Shanghai to Singapore. A packed but lovely flight on Singapore Airlines. My seat 59A was very wide and comfortable and had good legroom. The seat was practical and had a lot of compartments for me to store my things. Furthermore the IFE was responsive and there was a very large variety of movies available. A lunch menu was given to all passengers which is a great touch to an already good service. Lunch was served on my flight and it was a delicious pork and chicken combination. The crew provided excellent service and promptly provided me with drinks whenever I requested for them.
First off plane had no AC so it was hot. They had to wait 2 hours to board while they tried and failed to fix it. We finally board and after sitting on the tarmac for 45 minutes and they decide to turn the plane around because some lady is hot and wants to get off. Sat back at the gate for another hour until finally taking off 4 hours past our initial take off time all because their planes dont have air conditioning and theyre unorganized. This whole process the entire plane was left in the dark about what was happening they barely gave us any information.
Disappointed Booked the plane ticket 1 week before. On the day of check in at night they informed that the flight has been delayed for 7 hrs. I have to go for my duty on the same day but without any information they just said they will take me to a hotel take all the responsibility. They should have informed us 34 hrs before about the delay so that we could do something. Worst service. Will never travel with this airline.
After boarding our Montenegro Airlines flight on time we sat for 45 mins without any explanation and then told a crew member was ill and they would tell us what was happening soon. After another 45mins we were told that we would depart soon with only 2 crew. Because we were late Tivat airport had closed and we diverted to Podgorica the only other airport. We were then bused to Tivat arriving approx 5 hrs late to be told that there was nothing wrong as they class both airports as one Never again.
Delayed my flight last minute from Altoona to Pittsburgh due to the weather. It was a 30minute flight and the weather was clear and sunny in both locations. I told them this would cause me to miss my connecting flight and that Id have to rent a car. They did not even refund my 40 petty I was told that there was nothing they could do.
The worst flight I have flown with airline has no sense of responsibility towards their customer satisfaction and they dont value their time. I have taken a return trip flight with SpiceJet and both the times the flight was delayed by more than 4 hours. No communication was sent by the airline. When I asked one of assistant boarding staff to give the email ID of their supervisor she clearly said that she dont know the ID and during the flight the cabin crew were not cooperative. SpiceJet is very frequent in news for their delays and flight issues still no actions are taken from their side. I think the Managing Director and his team should look into this or else SpiceJet should restrict their business to India and close their international flights.
This is a no frills operation but they do it right. The on board staff was friendly and courteous and the plane was clean. We traveled from JFK to Paris and returned after 10 days. It was difficult to hear and see the movies they played but for those who read this is not a problem. The seats seemed small and not well padded. The planes took off and arrived on time a big plus and we did not have to wait long for our luggage. The woman who checked us in in Paris was exceptionally nice. No complaints and I would use this airline again.
Dubai to Bangkok via Muscat. We was due to fly to Thailand for my 60th Birthday but due to the Corvid 19 situation the flights got cancelled. I have been dealing with Oman Air Sales refund team since 18 March 2020 despite the tickets being Business class ticket I have not been offered a refund only that we can rebook the tickets within 18 Months. I have refused this offer due to that it was for a special occasion but dealing with there customer care and being told to make a complaint through their online service 3 Times numerous phone call etc. I am still offered the same No Refund. The worst Airline I have ever dealt with I would never use them again.
Truly one of the worst business class products on the market Im a frequent flyer and usually fly about 12 a month. Unfriendly staff both in the air and on the ground the most unappealing food imaginable late flights virtually guaranteed. Do not recommend.
San Francisco to Denver. Very disappointed customer. Ive been a huge champion of the Virgin American brand up to this point. My entire experience checking into this flight was miserable. It started when I tried to check into my flight online but wasnt able to. After an hour long chat with customer service I was told that there was nothing they could do for me and that I could check in at the airport no problem. So I get to the airport 2 hours early and proceed to self check in. I enter my confirmation code and the screen tells me that there is no matching customer reservation. So I call Virgin customer service and they are no help. They tell me to go to the Alaska terminal because that is where my flight was originally booked. So I start the process to head to the international terminal. Im freaking out at this point that I may miss the flight. I decide to call Alaska customer service before making the trek to the other terminal. The customer service for Alaska was very helpful and the one saving grace of this experience. They told me to go back to the Virgin terminal and try the self check in again. Still no luck. Then they tell me to find a Rep. The Rep who was manning the lines was terrible and unfriendly. She told me I needed to wait in the full checkin line. The line took 40 minutes and it was only 15 people long. Finally I get to the counter and the rep prints my boarding pass no problem. 2 hours later and Im just making it into the flight. What a terrible experience Virgin and Alaska need to figure this merger out asap. This is terrible.
Auckland to Dublin via Doha. Highly recommend this airline the crew plane food seat entertainment airport was all top class. We were able to request emergency exit on all four flights and given that both my partner and I are tall that is a major bonus. I paid extra to upgrade on the Doha to Auckland return flight and that was a whole other top class experience. New Zealand to Europe is a long flight but the cabin crew attendance with liquids and food and the whole series of Big Little Lies made the time fly on by.
El Al has the best Premium Economy product on this route US carriers dont compare to the seat pitch width and comfort impeccable service from the flight crew the food served on china a large selection of IFE and even the goodie bags. I like the curtain they use to cut off this section from economy.
Flew Atlanta to Bangkok via Doha. I was very impressed with the airline staff from when they entered the terminal heading to the aircraft and while in the air. Extremely professional and engaged in their job. Top notch although a long flight I was very comfortable and at ease. The light pink uplighting in the aircraft gives you a comforting feeling instead of the domestic aircraft that is stark white. The meals served were of decent quality. I have already recommended Qatar Airways for future travelers.
Were traveling with my wife and 6 year old son. When we got our boarding pass issued my sons boarding pass with different seat. We checked in about 245hr earlier prior to our flight time. Why cant our boarding pass be issued to be same row Why we could not have smooth trip and had to go through the trouble
Gatwick to Melbourne. This is the first time we have flown with Emirates and I cannot praise them enough. We flew from London Gatwick to Colombo via Dubai and then Colombo to Melbourne via Singapore in economy class. Ground staff at Gatwick were friendly and helpful and crew on board were attentive. Food was good and we liked having proper cutlery and not plastic. We lost an iPad on the first leg of the journey and Emirates not only answere pd our emails promptly they actually found the iPad and flew it on to an airport of our choice which was Melbourne. The staff in the Emirates office at Melbourne were also extremely helpful and friendly. Our flight from Colombo was delayed through no fault of Emirates but they offered reassurance and assistance and we made our connection easily with just 10 minutes to go before the gate closed. I fly twice a year to Melbourne and have flown with Air China Royal Brunei Quantas and mainly Etihad and to be honest we have had no problems with any of them but Emirates have certainly come out the best on this journey. I would highly recommend them.
This is the last time I spend any money with this airline. My flight was delayed almost 4 hours The ticket agent was rude. My wheelchair never arrived at gate. I mean this place is lousy. If you must travel Avoid American Airlines at all cost. I think Ill stick with Delta Air Lines.
The quality of food offered was quite satisfactory but the amount of it left me hungry. After using a Business Class washroom and walking the length of the plane to stretch my legs I was followed by a male flight attendant who stated that I was not entitled to use this washroom. He never inquired where I was seated. The purser had to intervene on my behalf and call that flight attendant to order.
Monastir to Budapest. Everything is okay. This is the third time if I fly with SmartWings. The food little sandwich is so tasty and the water is cold and everything is okay. I love this air company and if I fly I want it to be with the SmartWings.
Fully packed plane but service and seats were good on this sector. Food was okish I would not say great but ok. In flight entertainment was good. Plane was on time. Oldish 330 but comfortable
Amsterdam to Antalya with TUIfly. Kind and polite staff. Clean plane with a strange economy and comfort concept. Comfort first rows quite expensive but emergency exit rows with double the space for a fair 12 extra. Food and drinks for sale. Not cheap but good quality. Both flights on time. No complaints at all.
Copenhagen to Munich via Dusseldorf. Ive just been swindled by Air Berlin. When I booked the trip I was given one piece of baggage in the fare. When I called them to add a second piece they charged me 101 for it. I was stunned. I was expecting 25 35 perhaps for the second bag. They even sent me an email advertising extra baggage for 10 Euros if I booked it more than 30 hours out. Thats a laugh. They must be into false advertising. Maybe Im living in an unrealistic world but with high status on United I get two free bags on Lufthansa every time I use them and could have flown them more cheaply had I known about the excessive baggage fees. Moreover Im flying Air Berlin and Flybe to London City airport a few days later. They told me that I have to book my baggage at the airport because of the interline ticket which is bound to be even more expensive. I will never fly Air Berlin again.
Our flight was delayed from Kuala Lumpur so we had to transit for more than 24 hours in Doha. The airline did not inform us we had to apply for visa and so we wasted almost two hours trying to apply online. They gave us a three star hotel to stay in and bus for airport transfers during our unwanted stay in Doha. Cabin service were ok. I was travelling with family my husband daughter and I but only two of us was in business class due to limited seats availability. We couldnt enter the Al Mourjan lounge as a family.
Staff lied to us multiple times about the availability of business class seating and even attempted to print the wrong boarding pass which left us needing to get it changed at the gate. Staff were not remotely accountable nor did they care about receiving any feedback about our experience.
We boarded and arrived to destination late 30 minutes but inflight experience was nearly flawless. Cabin seemed to have some mood lighting comfortable leather seats with headrest and enough legroom. Crew pleasant and hardworking they spoke to passengers with onward connections about the state of their flight. Vegetarian salad was welcome as was the small bottle of wine. It certainly wasnt the cheapest flight but I noticed the difference.
A flight attendant dropped hot coffee on my leg as he was rushing. He went and come back after 23 minutes with some napkins tissue and ask me to wipe my pant with the napkins. The whole time in flight I had to travel with a wet pant. There was no apologies for that. My experience was not good flying this airline. The flight attendants are rude with the passengers.
Frankfurt to Windhoek and continuing onto Cape Town three days later economy. Easy check in at Frankfurt and smooth boarding. Old plane but comfortable seating and pleasant food. No individual entertainment system just the overhead screen. All staff very helpful and pleasant. Had special deal to upgrade on Windhoek to Cape Town flight for only 600 Namibian dollars. new plane with plenty of leg room and comfortable seat. Great service again. Pleasantly surprised all round and flights left on time arriving early in both cases. Recommended.
London to Shanghai. The Concorde room in Heathrow Terminal 5 was amazing the dinner experience was great and the food was delicious. However the First galleries was overcrowded and the buffet was bad. On the plane the crew was very friendly and nice. Dinner service was finished 1 hour after take off the food was okay. Bed was made after dinner and it was very comfortable perhaps the best I have had. The entertainment system was not as good as other airlines like Qatar Airlines and Emirates. Overall the journey was great.
Absolutely unpleasant and the worst flight Ive ever had. They delayed flight and caused me to miss the connecting trip which I also booked from Lufthansa bus express. In addition I lost my baggage because of it and nobody at the customer service point could help out. Person A from Lufthansa would say a completely different thing to person B and so on I talked to a number of Lufthansa employees and each of them said different things. I had to get my connecting bus ticket three times they made me miss my bus three times because of my lost luggage. The worst was when I was approaching one of the employees and with a very unfriendly tone she said Nobody can help you now. Come back tomorrow morning. I was roaming around the airport at midnight for hours asking them and thats what they told me. They even do not give me any compensation during the lost baggage period. Extremely disappointing.
Lisbon to Dubai EK192 on 8th April to Dubai for our sons wedding. This flight was superb from beginning with special assistance at Lisbon on time comfortable seats informative flight crew very good meal through to special assistance at Dubai. The cabin crew were one of the the best we have come across genuinely friendly on an a full flight welcoming everyone onboard regularly coming round to check that everything was alright and enquiring if we wanted more drinks and wishing all passengers a friendly farewell. Cost cutting was evident in that the seafood option has been removed as has the prelanding snackicecream but the meal provided braised beef was tender and tasty and larger than previous. Price was higher than normal because we had to travel over the Easter period.
By far the worst airline ever. They changed both flights with more than 10 hours without informing us. The contact center was unfriendly and useless. They change your seat after check in even if you paid for it from extra leg space to no extra leg space. Suddenly we didnt sit next to each other. Paying for the seats was hell on itself with a horrible site which errors all the time on the weirdest places. You can pay for ideal but afterwards thats suddenly not allowed. The return flight they changed my seat to again a space without extra leg space not next to my partner. I called 4 times about it. They said they will fix it but they didnt. The leg space was horrible I had pain in my legs the whole flight and we also were snatched at bu the cabin crew to put coat and small backpack under our seat. Even though there was no room for it and we had no trolleys. The airplanes were old not clean and the staff on board and contact center were unfriendly. And we had one hour delay on both flights without any information. We thought we booked with a respectable airline.
Paris to Mauritius. The food was good chicken fish and special meals. The entertainment on the plane wasnt good little screen with 18 channels and you couldnt choose a movie. Another issue was the leg space a problem when you are bigger than 180cms. The cabin crew was friendly and can speak at least 3 languages French English and a native language. When you have a question they will try to help you with a smile.
I agree with all other comments Ive read Flew Sharm to Luxor return last week and have never been so scared on take off or landing both ways. The MD83 was dirty dark and smelly and passenger comfort even on a short flight was non existent. On the return to Sharm we boarded the aircraft through the rear of the plane between the two engines which wereappeared to be slightly running. We had the same cabin crew as the morning flight 14 hours previously and they were virtually fainting from the heat. After sitting on the plane for nearly 20 mins before take off all passengers were incredibly hot to the point of wanting to disembark. The cabin crew did theyre best with limited resources. We also received juice and fig roll biscuits both ways but one lucky local passenger was given a hot meal. A holiday rep in the seat in front of us was using his mobile phone during the flight and no one stopped him. The sound of what appeared to be wind rushing through the cabin during the flight did nothing to inspire confidence. I have never been so glad to get off of an aircraft. My advice would be to check with your tour operator before booking an excursion because I would never travel with this airline again.
Chicago to Copenhagen via Keflavik. Cancelled flight 12 hours before we were leaving although flight is arriving in Chicago and returning to Europe tonight. Who gets to stay on we did not awful way of doing business never again
Checkin is done in the worst possible way. During the checkin process I wanted to check what other seats were available and their costs. However when I clicked on another seat my initial seat disappeared and I couldnt get it back. The only option left was to pay at least 25 euros for an available seat. I received a ticket without a seat assignment via email. Four managers were unable to provide a solution to this problem. The customer support couldnt find my booking based on all the information from the incoming emails. One of them even claimed it was a flight by Fly To Sky despite the registration being done through Tap Portugal and Fly To Sky doesnt have any collaboration with Tap Portugal as stated on their website. Only the last manager suggested canceling the registration and starting over. After doing so another seat became available again. All of this happened after an hour.
Arik Air flight from Lagos to London in economy class on A330. The inflight entertainment worked although it is not dated. Seat was very comfortable and the aircraft was nice and clean. Food was good but could have done with larger portions. I have flown with Arik in the past and of late things seem to be improving.
Titan Airways flew us back from Mytilene to Manchester Flight ZT1501 as part of the repatriation after TC collapsed. The flight was excellent particularly the stewardesses who were helpful efficient and courteous. The plane was very clean with better leg room than Ive had before on a typical economy class carrier at anytime in the past outside of long haul flights. The only gripe I had was the in flight entertainment it didnt work even though it said I was connected I got no connection to it at anytime of trying. This is why its only a 9 and not a 10 star review.
Very inconvenient lack of efficient communication. Buddha air should value their customers and theirs time. I had multiple travels last month all of those flights were 12 hours late. It would be helpful if they can announce incase of those scenarios for elderly customers.
I am extremely dissatisfied with the service provided by Wizz Air. I had booked a flight from Ankara to Abu Dhabi which was cancelled by Wizz Air without any prior notice or explanation just 23 hours before the scheduled departure. I had planned my trip almost two months in advance and had also purchased nonrefundable tickets for connecting flights. When I contacted Wizz Air to rebook my cancelled flight and sought assistance with my other airline tickets I was informed that they would not take any responsibility for my other tickets. Furthermore they could not provide any assurance regarding the possibility of my connecting flights being cancelled or not. As a result I had to reschedule all my other tickets and incurred additional expenses for hotel accommodations due to the cancelled flight. I strongly advise against using Wizz Air and do not recommend their services at all.
Paris to the Seychelles. The cabin itself is in good condition. the staff seemed a bit awkward and on the return flight was the entire crew were rude and arrogant. Food was as expected in the Economy. Despite seat reservation I had a different seat in the middle of three. I got no answer as to why my seat was changed.
If you have a connecting flight then for goodness sake dont fly this airline. You will have to suffer a lot at Terminal for transfer for boarding a bus to change terminal and for everything. Chances are you may miss your connection.
I will not recommend this airline to anyone. It seems no one wants to take accountability for anything. The ground staff was good but they input the TSA PRE CHECK was put in wrong so even though It said TSA precheck on my boarding pass but they did not allow me. Since the Airline was a partner of United we purchased our tickets with United Card so at least 1 bags can be checked in for free but no that does not work I had to pay 35 for the checked bag. When I returned to Orlando the bags took more then 1 hour to be on the belt so all the passengers were waiting for their bags. This was really a bad experience.
Johannesburg to Cairo. I can honestly say my wife and I were pleasantly surprised at our flight experience. Staff were very good and attentive. Food was good too much in fact. Aircraft in excellent condition and nice and clean. Overall a pleasant flight and would recommend Egyptair based on our experience .
First time flying with Pacific Airlines I booked through Vietnam Airlines. They damaged my luggage. The wheel was broken and they offered only 300k dong in compensation which is about US 10. Pretty low knowing I have to buy a new suitcase. They even brought back the wheel that was broken and gave it to me saying I could easily fix it. Was a terrible experience and I will not fly with them again.
Very good flight punctuality of the schedule respected clean plane friendly staff correct information during the flight correct plane comfort correct boarding and disembarking
vMy cabin bag which had my medicines were taken from me during boarding. Crew informed us that there is no space in the aircraft which we found out to be a lie the moment we entered the plane. I had to travel for 7 hours from LAX to Detroit and then to Toronto without my medicines.
Jakarta to Tokyo Haneda. Best airline experience Ive had of 2019 Crew was extremely friendly food and beverages were excellent The IFE was nice But one improvement The WiFi At first I was super excited as I connected but it did not work at all. Other than that this airline is awesome.
MSQKGDMSQ economy. Flights were around the New Year and usual for this route CRJ 100200 were replaced with larger aircraft. MinskKaliningrad with Tu154m. Cabin looked newer than expected and more comfortable although the cabin design was the lowest priority apparently. The crew were polite and very helpful the inflight service decent for the 50 min flight including cold drinks coffee tea and a small chocolate. Return flight was a packed and extremely shabby B737300 with no leg room the crew very much inferior to the previous one rude and inattentive. The website and online check in are functional the international airport Minsk 2 is horrible with no attempts from the staff to make things easier but this is not a major problem because it is empty.
Manchester to Dubai. Emirates is vastly overrated. Good inflight entertainment but that is it. Poor impersonal service that was surly their cabin crew are far from the best. The whole experience lacked any character and as for the afternoon tea before landing their version of a sandwich is a literally one quarter of what even the most diet conscious would expect. Fly Emirates to be treated like just a number. Not looking forward to return flight. Luggage took about an hour to arrive in Dubai.
We flew from LAX to Papeete and back. We were in a recently remodelled plane but the seats were terrible. They were tightly packed with very little leg room which is the norm. However the back was curved into a concave shape which was agony on a 8.5 hour flight. The headrests exacerbated the problem and my wifes wouldnt even stay up. The cushions were also stiff. There was no power outlet for the seats.
My wife and I flew from Birmingham to Palma and ten days later we returned with TUI. On both occasions we were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the planes the cheerfulness helpfulness of the crew professionalism of the pilot and the overall flying experience. Gripes include poor sound over the PA making pilot messages unintelligible lack of legroom and the usual hardsell that economy passengers have to endure for much of the flight. Our return was marred by horrendous Swissport handling mistakes that centred on misplaced landing e xit steps a 25 minute delay while these were repositioned followed by over an hours wait for our luggage to be loaded onto carousel 6. They offered no explanation or apology for these failings.
Paid to upgrade our seats and felt like we got a downgrade because our seats did NOT recline. Supposed to have been electronic device charging stations between the seats and there werent any on the plane at all. One of your flight attendants was very rude Will NEVER fly this airline again. There was also supposed to be onboard WiFi and it wouldnt work either.
Our first family holiday with 2 young children since pandemic hit. Even with the changes due to COVID no hot towel etc the standard remains remarkable especially the warmness of the cabin crews and extra care towards our 4 year old and 6 year old children. Drinks were replenished throughout the flight. Food and drinks were great with book the chef option. We had the signature Lobster dish and the meat was as tender as it can get for an in flight meal. Departure and Arrival were on time as usual and great effort by the cabin crew.
On Nov. 11 2022 a friend and I were booked to travel between Amsterdam and Cape Town an 11hour flight. As we are both women in our mid70s we decided to break budget and reserve business class. We did this well in advance through the Wtravel Group in Cape Town. The night before our departure we received notice from KLM that we would not have business seats because of a change in aircraft. We went to the airport hours early to rectify this. As far as we could find out we were the only two people on the flight who could not be accommodated in business class. Two 75year olds No amount of interceding could change this. They put us in Economy and offered a voucher for half the additional cost we had paid for business class as though we would ever use this airline again. Four months later hours and hours on KLM customer service many emails to the WTravel Group and we have yet to get any money back. KLM on its website says that a downgrade will be compensated according to the miles flown by up to 23 the cost of the flight. One customer service agent even suggested that since we took the flight we werent owed anything because it was nonrefundable.
YVRPDX. Check in a breeze and a small aircraft think it was a 28 seater. Got a drink and a few snacks as well. Crew on board were fantastic and a great flight. Seats were comfy.
App very easy to use and reasonable fare. The airport helpers in FUE exceptionally helpful as check in desk. The flight itself was operated by a friendly professional crew for whom nothing was too much trouble. Certainly fly again.
Beware you think one checked bag is available per person because you are flying internationally and thats the norm. However the fine print very fine print since no where in the ticket purchase did it say you have to go in separately to purchase bags at least 24 hours prior to trip. When you get to the airport they say you cannot check bags or must pay 25 per kg What Ive never heard of such a policy. After some haggling while worrying wed miss the flight entirely during this lengthy process we got the price to 225 for both of our bags which is still far steeper than the 105 it was supposed to cost again usually international bags on most airlines are free. We did pay 800 for a ticket after all. Then on board you cannot even get water soft drinks or coffee without paying a fee. Nothing is free. Plane is cramped. Im simply writing this review to save another person from this unexpected horrible experience. Fly another airline at all costs
KULNRTIAD Premium Economy service. There were multiple emails from ANA prior to travelling leaving instructions on what to do during travel in the Covid era. Some of these instructions are hard to follow and complicating. At KLIA no dedicated checkin counter but joint checkin with Economy. Checkin staff were good efficient and handled things without too many issues lounge access at MH golden lounge which was fine. The ANA lounge at Narita was very busy and had inadequate toilets and seating areas. On boarding no preferential boarding with PE unlike when I travelled with them 3 years ago. ANA board in groups and the boarding process in KLIA is poor with instructions from the gate staff which cannot be understood. On board FAs were fantastic they were attentive and proactive. No noise cancelling headphones on KLNRT sector but they were offered on NRTIAD flight. Where ANA falls short is in the meal service. Their meals are small in size and for a 12 hour flight between NRTIAD the quantity of food served is inadequate. The food is reasonable tasty but generally noting to shout home about. The cabin was kept clean throughout and toilets were immaculate. The IFA was mediocre. No TV shows just movies. The seats are starting to show their age but they were comfortable. The leg rest was useless as it didnt offer much support and the buttons used to operate the recline and leg rest were stiff and hard to press. Overall the flight is good value for money but catering needs to be improved.
Absolute shambles. My flights from Wellington to Los Angeles were voided without my consent. I received a text message on 19th February asking me to check in via the Qantas website. When I tried to do so on the webpage using my booking reference. However it said that I needed to go to the airport to check in. On Feburary 19th I went to the Wellington airport. Two employees working for the contractor company that works for Qantas at the airport tried to provide me with my tickets. However they were told by the ticketing department that my flights had been voided. The person in the ticketing department claimed the flight had been voided by American Airlines their partner airline. On 1 December I was surprised to receive a partial refund of around 177NZD a fraction of the approx. 1705 NZD I had paid for the flights. This made no sense as I had asked Qantas several times via email and over the phone to specify what the refund was for in November 2022 without receiving an answer from them. In November I had asked them to change my flight date and paid them to process this request. On February 19th I was asked to call the Qantas hotline as the employees at the airport were unable to help me. To my disbelief the hotline staff told me that they would not reissue the tickets nor provide a full refund. I absolutely do not recommend this airline. If you want to make any changes to your flight dates be prepared to spend hours on their hotline if you are flying internationally. I dont wish anyone to go through the saga I am going through with them. I am almost 2000NZD out of pocket because of the mistakes that have been made. I still have not received an answer from them nor a full refund and compensation.
I was incredibly surprised when I was denied boarding on my flight last week from Rome to Zante because I did not include my middle name on the booking. Upon finding this out Blue Panoramas office to update the ticket with middle name claimed that their machines were down I must say it was not a good look for their airline and their online reviews have suffered because of it this would probably explain why their plane was at 40 capacity. I only checked the reviews after this disgusting experience. They claimed I needed to buy a new ticket. To charge the full price for a replacement ticket when my middle name was not even added to the new ticket is quite frankly appalling. The airline also made me buy me new ticket in cash It is a complete scam and I honestly will throw a party when this airline goes under. I strongly recommend that you do not fly this airline.
In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow no hello from the crew and the same getting off. I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant. I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes its not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. Ive never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss. Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined. Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. I would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is.
Freeport to Nassau. I see a lot of negative reviews and Im really not sure why. Ive flown Bahamasair my whole life and while theyre not the best in the world I feel very safe with them. I experienced a slight delay my last time flying but I trust every delay with any airline is for a reason and put my safety above impatience. Ive only flown on their newer aircrafts within the past 6 months Ive been flying more frequently so I cant really remember what the older planes are like. But the new ones are great clean and bright on the inside. The crew are kind as most Bahamians are the flights I take are always under 45 mins and completely stressfree. Like I said I dont remember what the old planes are like so I only speak for the new planes. But I prefer them to a lot of other airlines Ive been on. Including American ones I know Bahamasair pilots to be very talented fliers and thats whats most important to me. Its just a plus that the interior looks nicer now and since I dont experience any extreme delays I really have nothing to complain about.
It was very unpleasant journey since flight supposed to start at 10.25 which delayed to start 2.09 pm landed at 5.32 pm instead of 2pm. However airlines did not let out passengers after 6.48pm still in the flight. It was very stressful journey and our vacation totally collapsed. I would not recommend anyone to Alaska airlines for Hawaii vacation.
We spent extra to be upgraded to First to fly from London Heathrow to Dallas Fort Worth. It was definitely not worth it. The 777 has smaller first class seats they have expanded the number of seats too. There are now around 20. Cabin crew were young and clearly without enough experience. Quite unhelpful and it took a long time to get meals they have been taught to do everyone individually. That doesnt work when they have expanded the number of passengers. Cabin crew clearly felt their only responsibility was to feed us. They disappeared after lunch for many hours until it was time for tea. Which is now a meal less adequate than it used to be in Club. Further First Class food is far from first class. Fewer choices and what is provided is not good. Very disappointing. First Class in BA used to be restful and the food was decent.
Gatwick to Dar es salaam via Kigali. Plane has a good cabin configuration with good seat sizes and leg room in economy. Configuration at the rear of aircraft allows a large number of 2 seat allowing easymore access. Boarding at LGW was quick and easy. Cabin staff are efficient and happilyarrange passengers with infants and mobility to be in better seatsnear bathrooms. Meals were very good surprisingly as the presentation was not great it was a very bland looking tray when it arrived but the food was very tasty basic in my case Salad Chick curry and a chocolate sponge. On arrival at Kigali I was informed of a 6 hour delay to my connecting flight to Dar es Salaam these are the moments that test airlines how do they deal with this. In the same breath and informing me of the delay I was informed we have a shuttle bus waiting downstairs to take you to a local 4 star hotel. Escorted to Immigration front of que a 10 second stamp of passport to be whisked to the Hotel in 25 minutes to have a welcome juicewater room keys and the wifi code. The room was a suite toiletries and a note of what time lunch will be and pick up time back to the airport. Refreshed and fed back 6 hours later to have an uneventful connection to Dar es Salaam. Once again a bland looking lunch served on the plane but again it was very tasty full of flavours. Kigali Airport small but works efficiently the most armed Police I ever seen inside and surrounding an airport but everything moves at a steady pace despite the numerous rigorous security checks.
We checked in for our business class flight with Condor. There was no lounge available in a small airport which is fine but seating was difficult because the terminal was crowded with inadequate facilities. Personally I would not fly through Dusseldorf airport again. But the unbelievable shocking con perpetrated by Condor really began when we got on board. We noticed on boarding that there was no difference between the seats in socalled business class and the rest of the aircraft. No dividing curtain no extra legroom. In fact there was far less legroom than the extra space seats that Tui sell on their charter flights. The only demarcation was a headrest cover which stated business class and an empty seat between seat A and C. It did not help that a couple who shouldve been in row six had occupied our seats in row five which were immediately in front of the economy section of the aircraft which began in row six. This led to an awkward situation where the couple who had to move could not understand why we had an empty seat between us. The couple who had to move called the chief stewardess over to explain why we had an empty seat and they didnt. The whole way through the flight because there was no dividing curtain we were subjected to angry stares and unnecessary and deliberate pushing of our seats. Its an incredibly shortsighted policy of Condor to decide not to have any dividing feature between these two cabins. As with each part of the service the people sitting right behind us were clearly angry that the free drinks and some free food stopped at our row. They made their displeasure clear by constantly pushing our seats and kicking the bottoms. Also the socalled business class because there was no curtain divider was the constant through route for the toilet from economy. Worse than the objectionable passengers behind us was the absolute lack of differentiation between the seat pitch in these expensive seats compared to those behind. There is not even a recline button on any of the seats not in business class nor in economy. Condor seats are fixed at approximately 90 angle and our knees were already touching the seats in front which is clearly why they cant allow anyone to recline their seat by even a couple of degrees. Neither of us are particularly tall. We have never been on a less comfortable or more unpleasant flight in many years of flying in business class. I would never set foot on a Condor flight again in any class and suggest anyone reading takes the same stance.
Originally flight was scheduled on 29th June 0035 1235 AM. Interestingly this flight got delayed from 1235 AM to 130 AM. I booked this tickets from Trip.com and I get the notification on 135 that your flight departed. Thanks for choosing us. I was like they didnt even start the boarding. Its 215 AM Finally made my way to sit inside the plane and pilot announced We are still waiting for one crew member who is coming from Calgary and that will take more 15 mins. No apologies. Shame on you that you run a waste service that even your staff doesnt follow your rules. I was supposed to reach Toronto before 630 AM. Now I will reach there 4 hours later and no sleep for entire night. I frustrated and angry on myself because I paid 350 for my emergency.
Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack aircon at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 34 full but the rest of the plane cant have been much more than 20 occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that the drink and food service in business was efficient and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after takeoff which is a real bonus on a nighttime flight. However the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats dont significantly aid sleeping particularly as theres an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons. Overall a good flight.
Manchester to Fuertaventura with Monarch Airlines. We opted to buy extra legroom seats and were pleased that we did. On the outbound leg we were about 40 minutes late taking off which they blamed on need to deice the plane but in truth we did not start boarding until 10 minutes after departure time and this was slowed by a demand for some passengers to put their hand luggage in the hold. Due I think to items for the return flight being stored in the overhead lockers by the staff. Flight was good and arrived only just behind schedule. The return flight was smooth and arrived ahead of time. Monarch is very like a lot of other low cost airlines and you pay for what you get. A seat on the plane anything else is extra and at 4 for a small can of lager 1.80 for a can of pepsi max and 4.50 for a bacon panini plus hold luggage charges and so on can work out very expensive. The panini by the way was very hot very dried out and tasteless. Staff were pleasant and professional throughout. A good airline compared to some low cost options.
I flew from Helsinki to Istanbul and onward to Kathmandu. I was told in Helsinki that they were not sure if I would be able to receive my luggage at the same time in the destination when I arrive. However to make sure I asked Turkish Airlines in Istanbul Airport if my luggage was on board. And the female official confirmed that the one luggage is on board. To my surprise I didnt receive my luggage here in Kathmandu. It is now clear that she lied to me about my luggage. I was told by Turkish Airlines that they have no knowledge about my luggage. Some say that they can not track my luggage some say it will come in next flight. I am in Kathmandu just for 1014 days only. Already here the second day and really cold here. While asking around I am told that Turkish Airlines have many luggage mismanagement incidents specially when you have transit in Istanbul. It is really sad that I have to give a bad review because contrary to management staff the cabin crew were friendly. The meal was good flight was comfortable. But they are real mess when it comes to luggage handling.
Hong Kong to Toronto. In advance I paid extra for a seat with extra leg room beside the exit door . In Bali my previous destination I broke my foot right before the flight to Hong Kong not knowing it was broken I boarded the flight of 5 hours in excruciating pain. Once I landed I realized it was broken Immediately called my doctor back home and asked what I needed to do. I didnt have travel insurance so I could not afford to go to a hospital. He instructed that I elevate my leg and ice it on the plane. When I arrived at the boarding gate in a wheelchair the flight attendant said nothing to me about changing my seat from the exit row not until we were boarding on the ramp did I realize my seat was moved. At the door of the plane I asked why this was. They told me because I couldnt help in the case of an emergency. They put me in a middle seat behind this exit aisle. When I requested a change of seat they said there was nothing left but Economy Plus something I would need to pay for if I wanted extra room. I had no choice but to upgrade my seat to ensure my leg was elevated can you imagine a 15 hour flight with no pain medication and the cabin pressure causing extreme discomfort... well dont worry this airline cant imagine it either. They charged me 2600 Canadian dollars to is in a seat that had leg room. I hope someone from this airline looks into this because I am very dissatisfied with your customer service.
Tamale to Accra. Good onboard service juice snack and a meat pastry. Thing that let it down was pre flight experience. Their online card payment system for the flight never works. It charged me twice for my flight and their customer service call centre is so shocking that after one month of trying they didnt refund. Had to do a charge back through my card. They then cancelled my booking although I had still paid. They didnt tell me they had cancelled it. I luckily checked my booking 2 hours before the flight.
Taipei Taoyuan airport has Hello Kitty echeck in counter its very cute. A delay for more than one hour ground staff offers cookies and drinks apple juice or water. Boeing 777300 seats are comfortable for Premium Economy class. The flight is very short but offers a cake and cup of teacoffee. Eva Air is worth 5 star rating.
Weve traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checkedin in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and dont get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still havent received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should redo the online account application which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again but since the I havent received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha but yet again they cant help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats but in the end you do not get it.
Istanbul to Singapore. Disorganized boarding this time. Rather long bus ride to remote stand. A330 with lie flats and extensive IFE but no onboard Wifi. The onboard catering was extensive and substantial a la TK style. Cabin crew were hard working and gave an overall good level of service. Arrived almost as scheduled delayed slightly to heavy traffic at Changi. Overall another solid long haul flight with TK.
12 hour flights are going to be rough that is a given. The airline industry even found ways to make long flights more uncomfortable as they have tried to respond effectively with Covid. Some background I am 63 and a little claustrophobic. I look for every opportunity not to wear a mask. I dont like it when the passenger in front of me puts their chair back as far as it will go into my face. But I know going in a 12 hour flight is not going to be a picnic. This flight was no picnic but it was alright. Premium economy was an expensive choice but it guaranteed more comfort. The seat in front of me was all the way back most the flight but magical seat configuration made that less of an issue. Plenty of leg room. The food was good and they fed us at decent intervals. The flight attendants were nice. They provided noise canceling headphones which was a nice touch though I never used them because I could find nothing on their entertainment that I wanted to watch more than what I had on my iPad. The worst part of the trip was the Los Angeles traffic after we touched down.
My wife and I flew to Majorca on 10517. Everything was fine as far as the flight was concerned on time very courteous and professional cabin crew. My main gripe is the lack of legroom between the seats. I am six feet tall and weigh just over 19 stone. I could not fold the food and drinks tray fully down and had to put my coffee on my wifes tray. My knees were pressed up against the back of the seat in front. I didnt see why I should have to pay for extra leg room I have flown several times with other airlines and have never had problems in that respect. On arrival at Palma there was no Rep to greet us and show which bus to get to our hotel. Eventually we got a Jet2 rep to show us where the Monarch desk was to find out the number of our bus. At no time did any correspondence from Monarch or indeed Thomas Cook our original booking agents who placed us with Monarch give any instructions about procedure upon arrival at the airport. I feel that this is an area that needs attention I feel that Thomas Cook took our holiday booking placed us with Monarch and then washed their hands of us and took no further part in our holiday the same applies to Monarch.
Orlando to Dubai. Check in was fast service at the airport is good I asked if I could enter the business lounge despite my silver class had expired 3 months ago and they accepted. Although the flight was really long 14 hours I enjoyed it entertainment system is still one of the best the food and beverages are awesome. Only complain for this flight is that the headphones are a bit cheap but I guess for the money I paid for this trip they are ok.
I travelled many airlines Air Asia IndiGo Akasa on my recent India trip. Akasa Airlines is miles ahead in Customer service at Airport Customer Service Call Centre. Very new comfortable seating and facilities in flight. Flight takeoff and landing is also very good didnt feel that we had landed. Keep up the great work within no time youll be Indias best airline.
Hong Kong to London. I booked a return ticket for my sister though BA provided travel document details they required. However when we got to the airport we found out my sisters middle name was not on her ticket and it therefore didnt match her passport name. They refused to let her fly after much hassle and my sister getting a temporary visa they enable her to fly. However once landing in London I acknowledged that she may have the same problem flying back to Taiwan. Igot in contact with BAs executive phone helpline service yet spending a day speaking to them they have only caused me to speak to numerous different people all telling me to do different things. We have still not resolved the issue of her ticket not having her middle name on. BA are refusing to alter the ticket information to add my sisters middle name onto the ticket. They have not been helpful on the phone when i asked them to add her middle name and are not interested in try to solve the issue at hand. They were insistent on speaking to my sister who is from Taiwan and I told them she is unable to speak english and that i can translate any question for her. They did not allow this so she was put on the phone however they only spoke English to her.
This was my first time flying Cathay so I cannot compare it to its previous glory days. Overall I was satisfied with my experience. Cathay is comparable to the other better airlines out there though none of them are particularly great these days. I liked that I could check in 48 hours in advance and take 2 suitcases with an economy fare which is better than most airlines. Having to enter my advance passenger information 4 times once for each flight there and back was ridiculous however. Boarding was well set up with separate lines clearly signposted for each class of passenger. This prevents massive scrums to board. On both flights B777 and A350 legroom was good seat recline was excellent and IFE was very good with large selection of entertainment and high quality screens. Cabin service was efficient if rather robotic and cold. Meals were pretty decent especially the Asian dishes. I particularly liked the curry fried fish with rice and the noodles with dumplings. On my return the flight from Perth was delayed by 2 hours. I received good advance notification via email and text message about this so I could leave 2 hours later to the airport. Fortunately the delay worked out well for me as it reduced my stopover in Hong Kong from 9 to 7 hours I have two major criticisms both regarding the 15hour flight between Toronto and Hong Kong 1 The new 10abreast seating on the B777 is awful apparently Cathay used to have 9abreast seating until recently. The seats are very narrow and the armrests stickthin. For 15 hours you are constantly being elbowed knocked and brushed by your neighbour as well as people walking down the aisle if you have an aisle seat. I have a very slender and narrow build so I cannot imagine how passengers with broad shoulders or who are overweight can tolerate this seating. Sadly virtually all airlines now have this 10abreast seating on their B777s so passengers may have little alternative but to suffer. The FAA should not have allowed this layout especially for superlonghaul flights like this. 2 There were only 2 meals served on this very long flight one after takeoff and one before landing. No meal service for 12 hours inbetween Snacks were available in the galley throughout the flight but they were minuscule literally bitesize and unhealthy. There really should have been a third meal or proper snack box served midflight. Im not sure if this is standard among other airlines for superlonghaul flights but its woefully inadequate. Despite these two criticisms and with alternative airlines not really being better overall I would choose to fly Cathay again.
BA cancelled my return flight on 09Feb20 from Geneva to Gatwick due to storm Ciara. They rebooked me onto a later flight then cancelled that as well. Since then I heard nothing more and I was left on my own to buy a new return flight. Ive tried calling them several times every day but they are not answering their phones claiming they are too busy to talk to customers. They cancelled my flight so I want a refund but so far there is no way of getting through to them.
London to Geneva. Im not sure British Airways are committed to short haul business anymore and can see them going high density economy seating only as some others do. Business seat same as economy everyone now knows about but the downgraded food lunch consisted of a small plate with a slice of ham slice of Palma ham and dollop of buffalo mozzarella cheese and a bread roll. And that was that. Not even butter with the roll. Guess the value of food was about GBP1. Crew did their best with a poor product. Flight on time. Not worth a premium over economy ticket.
Nok Air has online Checkin 24 hours before to print out your boarding pass and can go directly to security and gate if one isnt checking a bag. Also you can change your flight for an extra charge online. Everytime I ever needed to call Nok Air they answered promptly. If one has a bag to check like I did there is a special line at Don Muang Airport for those who checked in online. My flight was full during the busy New Year and many people brought on roller bags with other carry ons even though only one small 7 kilo carry on is permitted at the cheapest fare and one must pay a higher fare to check roller bags. The cabin attendant didnt object to these passengers bring on so much but amazingly worked hard to get all the bags into the overhead bins in time for take off. I noticed that nearly everyone did not put small things under the seat in front of them but instead taking up needed space of the overhead bins. The plane departed on time and arrived on time and my checked bag was soon on the carousel. Nok Air hasnt disappointed yet.
CDG to LAX. The cabin was very cramped and hot throughout the flight but service and food was quite good and a real surprise after our experience on the ground. We arrived two hours ahead of time at CDG. After it took over an hour about 75 minutes to check in we then got in line next to go through security. After waiting about 30 minutes and becoming very concerned about them shutting the doors before we got through I asked the now idle checkin people if there was a way to get us through so we would not miss the flight. The manager very dismissively told us to get to the back of the line there was nothing he could do. After another 20 minutes with a security agent telling us to just have an airline rep walk us to 1st class line and being told again by the to just go back to the end of the line a security agent walked us to another area and through 1st class line. We were very surprised when we got onboard to see the same inept and rude people who did checkin were the first class and business class stewards. All they had to say to us when I said I was worried about missing the flight was We know you are here checkedin and in line for security. We wont leave without you. Instead rudeness and attitude was all I got.
Bali to Hong Kong. I am so disgusted. My flight was changed without any notification leaving my stranded in Bali. No explanation has been given and now I must stay here and extra day. The service is uncontactable unless youre in a Marco Polo club. No phone numbers are given. Now I am stranded for 2 days.
Do not book with Avelo if you even think you may have to adjust your trip. The wording on their refund policy is sneaky. Unless you cancel within 24 hours of your initial booking you get locked into having Travel Credits. Additionally like Spirit Airlines they ding you with every fee possible for baggage. Do not recommend at all.
I fly Fly540 regularly between Mombasa and Nairobi and have nothing but good things to say about the product and service. The airline is a lowcost carrier operating within Kenya and to a number of points outside such as Zanzibar and Juba. Nairobi to Mombasa is usually operated by a Canadair aircraft. I choose to fly Fly540 because it is cheaper than the other carriers on the routes I travel the terminal they use in Nairobi is far easier to use and their punctuality has always been excellent. Check in in Nairobi is a dream as it is handled in the new Terminal which is almost always empty. Security takes around 5 minutes and then you check in in the big open terminal. This terminal was built as a temporary structure but I think is here to stay. After checkin there is a further security checkpoint before you enter the departure lounge. Here there is a very small premium lounge accessible by payment or Priority Pass etc. an a larger open boarding gate area. There is a small cafe selling cold and hot drinks and some basic food items but no shops. The info screens above the gate have never shown the correct flight information at any time I have flown. Staff are unfortunately very uncommunicative here which is a problem if you want to get information from them this is not the case with the Mombasa staff who seem much more customerfriendly. Boarding is usually started about 15 mins prior to departure through one of the gates and you normally walk to your aircraft. Cabins look worn but not dirty. There is always a complimentary beverage service tea coffee water or type of soda and a biscuit more than you get on BA or many of the European legacy airlines let alone low cost. The inflight magazine is a good read. Flights has always arrived pretty much on schedule and I have never had problems with baggage damage or loss. An excellent little airline which performs well above its lowcost price tag. Fly540 unfortunately do not have any form of frequent flyer reward program.
Has anyone experienced a Comair cancellation We did from JNB to WDH in Namibia. We booked the flight through BA in the UK and BA couldnt care less even though its sold as a BA flight. They have refused to accept any responsibility. For all flights in or out of the EU BA would be liable for compensation but they refuse to behave with any sort of honour you just cant trust them. Comair were hopeless at Joburg management refused to come and talk to the passengers. Comair staff gave us incorrect details of how to complain. Comair of course dont even have the courtesy to respond to emails once we had found out the right one to use. Be warned this airline is a disgrace.
Gatwick to Kigali. The best way to get around Africa due to the young fleet of planes that is well maintained. Exceptional staff. Rwandair is always my first choice of carrier. Kigali is my favorite stopover city as well. I am glad they will be expanding with flights to New York soon.
First our flight was delayed then after sending us up and flying for an hour they sent us back because apparently our plane needed scheduled maintenancey. After returning to Dallas we waiting in the runway for hours. Our flight was scheduled to arrive in Cancun at about 1250. It is 1pm as I type this we have not been informed of anything have not moved are just smelling air plane fumes and have had our vacation start off terribly. I thought that it would be a cheap alternative to American Airlines but I think paying that extra for less delays will be worth it. Save yourself some time and fly another airline if youre going to Cancun from Dallas.
Horrible customer service. Flight delayed from Dominica to San Juan yet no announcement made. No agents anywhere in site. Finally had to ask security to have an agent come to speak with us. Instead of a person the loudspeaker then came on with announcement only telling of delay. No specifics at all. Called LIAT in Antigua only to be told had to speak to my agent here. Since he was still invisible given local number which was not available without calling corporate. Just praying to get out today without having to spend an extra night trying to get to Atlanta.
Paris CDG to San Jose via Zurich. Terrible experience Its been 3 days and they have not responded to my emails about my missing luggage the people at the airport said they never loaded the luggage on the plane in Paris and that I have to file a report with the airline but the airline is not responding to any emails. I was surprised about how terrible the service was even though I reserved seats for the first row because my wife and I traveled with our 19 month old on lap and I asked for a cradle they assigned me on two middle seats with no aisles. When I asked the stewardess if she would help us she just said the flight was full and looked upset about the baby I understand other passengers looking upset about a baby on a long flight they are not supposed to provide any service to you but the stewardess lack of empathy with our situation was bothersome. When I asked if they had baby food like the one they gave us on the flight towards Paris she said that I had to have ordered it prior to the flight.
Bangkok to Frankfurt via Doha on Qatar Airways and both legs were on time seats comfy staff very friendly. Could have checked more often during the night if drinks were needed. My choice of glutenfree meals had been respected on our outbound flight on the return flight they forgot about it. The movie choice was interesting. But on the leg Doha to Frankfurt I could neither finish the film that I had started on the first leg nor enjoy any other of them. Shortly after the start my entertainment system broke down completely out of the blue. As some rows in front of me a passenger seemed to have a medical problem the steward was not able to look after such a minor problem as mine. So I was not even able to enjoy all the reworked blurredskinsequences that made my husband laugh as I sat on the other side of the aisle and could not watch his screen either. By chance I had a good book and after an hour or so I fell asleep. As I had another problem with my entertainment computer on the outflight too I think Qatar should check their IFE more regularly.
Twice delayed flights plans ruined because cant make connecting fought to destination. They dont give a damn. Done with them. Recommend you choose another carrier.
This is the worst airline. The airline preponed my flight and I had 22 hrs transit in Istanbul. Above all I accepted the offer because I had an emergency and I needed to fly anyway. They did not give any information beforehand I tried to contact the service center and even went to the airport to find someone at the service desk if possible but it almost impossible to communicate with the airline. I tried to request the staff through telephone they convinced me that my request for a hotel room in Istanbul airport will be accepted. when I reached the airport for checkin they demanded that I need to apply for an evisa that would cost 120. I was about to miss my flight but the staff was so not cooperative even the person at the service desk was very rude. However I finally managed to get on board. I expected to get a room in the airport Hotel in Istanbul but my request was rejected. It was the worst experience spending time in Istanbul airport for 22 hrs. Maybe because I was an economy class passenger they treated me so badly but I think it is someway their responsibility until I reach my destination. Those 22 hrs in Istanbul airport was a trauma for me. I would not recommend traveling with this airline.
San Francisco to Taipei. We have flown EVA every January the past 8 years. The plane is always cleaning comfortable and the stewardesses are always immaculate and professional. Our recent trip Jan 9 2019 BR0027 the cabin crew was exceptional and should be recognized as excellent employees.
CANSHA by B737 SHACAN by B767. Both flights more or less ontime and we found the check in procedure time spent at the Star Alliance Gold Card lounges and onboard service pleasant and troublefree. Shanghai Airlines is still our choice for domestic flights within China
Bangkok to Yangon return. Departing journey was OK plane interior was quite shabby and needed a refit. The food could have been better. FAs were good at their job very friendly. The return flight was better the interior was better with Air Bagan logos they served a continental breakfast which was very good. There was no problem with weight excess baggage was waived.
Munich to Paris CDG. As I have mostly heard negative reviews about Air France I was prepared for the worst. I was wrong. Check In in both Munich and Paris was a breeze. We were on Sky Priority which meant that we could board the plane first and our luggage was delivered first as well. The cabin was neat very tidy and an excellent inflight magazine is available. Only downside is the seat pitch. The crew on both flights was absolutely amazing. Very professional and attentive a warm smile and everyone spoke great english some flight attendands also spoke german too. Another surprise was the delicious snack we received and the great variety of beverages offered. It was a flight of one hour and Air France and its crew did an outstandig job. Im looking forward to fly with them again.
Took two domestic flights on Air Bagan one from Yangon to Bagan and another Mandalay to Yangon. Both flights were with ATR72 aircraft. The interior of this aircraft was very cramped with hardly any leg space. The aircraft definitely showed its old age. The flight from Mandalay to Yangon was free seated and flight was completely full. The inflight service was nice and they served savoury croissants and cakes with drinks. Regarding reservations the booking system is fairly tricky. Also the airline requires the passenger to confirm the flights at least 24 hours before departures. Yet the 4 phone lines are constantly busy. For both flights our hotels repeatedly tried calling to no avail. Air Bagan offers value for money because there is hardly any competitive alternative today.
The airline cant even inform you anyway through texts or emails if a flight has been cancelled. Called customer service and when it was something they didnt understand they automatically transfer you mid sentence while you are talking and then you have to wait 10 20 minutes for a new operator.
Delays both coming and going. Missed my connection by over three hours. To make matters worst the customer service was incompetent and rude. They cancelled my flight unannounced to me and treated me like I was the problem. Do whatever possible to take any other airline
I have chosen Swoop 4xs and of those times 2 have been cancelleddelayed until the next day. It is a 5050 risk of cancellation with Swoop. Despite there claim of a live rep you can call 247 there is no live customer service it is a recording that directs you to their social media. Messages can take up to 3 weeks for a response despite their claim to respond within 72 hours. Bookings must be changed within 24hrs if you need a refund but they do not respond within that time frame. With their constant time changes and cancellations Swoop takes advantage of customers. Im done losing my time and money to them.
Ankara to Amsterdam via Istanbul. After a mediocre Business class flight to Turkey with them we decided to stay at Economy for our flight back. The IFE is pretty good and worked well for me. Food and drinks are also okay. However cabin service was way too slow for a very short ESBIST flight which overhastened the eat and drink joy for half of the plane. ISTAMS service was alright although the food quality is drastically decreasing. Their ground service and staff have major setbacks everywhere only getting worse. Also the seat pitch for both flights were literally terrible barely 30 inches each. Their economy seat pitch does not put them above the category of lowcost carriers. They used to be my favorite airline not anymore. I no longer prefer them if I have another major airline option on any route.
London to Manila via Kuwait. I was very nervous after reading the reviews on here. However I have to say they were fantastic. The other passengers were a nightmare and I can see why the staff get the hump. The way they were treated was criminal.
Checkin is efficient. Fokker aircraft are ok while the Russian Tupolev aircraft should be avoided at all cost. The snack provided was standard. The staff was generally friendly. All in all an average airline.
Saint Martin to Paris Orly via Pointe a Pitre. Not an experience Id like to repeat. First my French isnt great so I had to find out at Pointe a Pitre that I needed to check in but I didnt need to pick up my hold baggage. So that meant I had 2 hours of queuing to check in go through customs and security leaving it very fine to get my flight. Luckily the flight was delayed by 1 hour 30 so there was no rush. The boarding process was confusing and disorganised with continual announcements apologising for delays calling babies children rows and a reminder that seats EFGH boarded through gate A seats ABCD boarded through gate B. The FAS were ok. Apart from when they left our food on our trays for 40 minutes I took our trays up in the end and they said they forgot. They also left a full cup of coffee in the holder for landing despite us trying to ask them to take it away. Food was not great especially the tub of apple pure baby food and a bread roll for breakfast. The in flight entertainment was limited for English speakers and we arrived late so I missed my connecting flight. They also left baggage from everyone who connected from Saint Martin in Point a Pitre. Which was weird considering we were delayed. I called customer service to try and upgrade my flight in the hope an upgrade would make the return journey less unpleasant. My french isnt great which I explained but the customer service girl lost patience and cut me off. I will never fly Air Caraibes again.
I checked in as normal at the desk because for whatever reason online check in or the console check in wasnt working for me. The member of staff assigned a seat which turned out to be right at the back of the plane. It was strange because i was the only foreigner on the plane and nobody else was seated on this back row. On the back row the seats do not recline and the arm rests do not fold up. A very uncomfortable flight but i thought nothing of this until my next point. The cabin crew acted as if i did not exist. I watched as they offered everyone else water and other things but when it came to me theyd ignore my existence and walk by. This made me feel horrible. It was a 6 hour flight no meal was provided. Not even a snack. I understand this is budget but this is a joke. Im a frequent flyer all over the world this service was poor beyond belief. Do not recommend.
I would avoid it at all costs. They are very disorganized all 4 of our flights were randomly delayed and we ended up losing a business class seat that we paid for and they never refunded us. No one from customer support is responsive they lie and ignore your emails and questions.
Our family of 7 had a trip to Cancun for June 2020 with Interjet. I was able to get vouchers that we still arent able to use They dont answer phone calls no phone number is working for us not even the one in Mexico. We have tried booking online but it doesnt allow us to dont know what to do anymore. This is stressful and very unprofessional. Today I found their email and sent them one I really hope we dont lose our money this is unfair.
Vladivostok to Moscow. Very pleasant surprise one of the best flights Ive recently had. Aircraft was a bit dated but very comfy with a decent legroom. Being 63 i didnt find it uncomfortable on 8 hours flight. The food is great drinks selection could be better but nevertheless was OK. Toothbrush as well as slippers and eyemasks were provided which made the flight much better.
Manchester to Punta Cana. We have flown Thomson on numerous occasions and never really had any complaints. This was our first time on the Boeing 787 and we decided we would give economy a try. Whilst the seats are slightly bigger I wasnt fond of the 3x3x3 formation. We like the Boeing 787 and have booked both Jamaica and Mexico for 2018. That said we have booked premium for both. Personally the upgrade and what comes with is worth the additional cost. That said there is nothing wrong with economy. The staff were kind and polite. Im not a fan of food served on planes at thats the same for premium. I wouldnt mark the airline down on that though as I am not a fan of the meals served on BA or Virgin either. I would recommend Thomson.
First time flying on the A350 and it makes the flight from Munich to Singapore considerably more comfortable than on the 777. As usual Singapore Airlines staff were friendly and professional as we were traveling with a toddler we were invited to board first and get ourselves settled. Stewardess came by to check if we needed anything for our daughter and if we would like our meals at different times. Seats were comfortable row 41 which has the advantage of lots of leg room but has fixed armrests which hems you in a bit. There is an extensive selection of movies which will keep most people entertained for a flight longer than the 11 hours we had. SQ is saving money a bit with the food portions getting smaller but flavour and quality were still there. A350 is quiet and the lower cabin preasure is noticeable in that you arrived refreshed even after the long flight I even managed a few hours sleep. Flight departed a bit late but arrived 30 min ahead of schedule. Once again Singapore Airlines is a great way to fly.
Flew from London to Calgary. The seats in the new Dreamliner are awful. It was bad enough sitting in the seat but when the person in front of me lowered his seat it became impossible. His seat was right on my legs that shows how little room there is on these planes. Staff started serving meals all of a sudden went by about 7 or 8 rows of us and forgot to come back to feed us.
I used avios point to upgrade from economy to premium economy. They get a wider seat and a few more inches leg room. Boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne. The staff were well turned out but rushed as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew. A hot meal was served an hour after take off which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables chocolate mousse and biscuits cheese. Quality red and white wine was served. The inflight movie selection was OK. A light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee tea. Getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports. Not my best flight.
Hong Kong to Seoul Incheon. Check in staff was proper but nothing special to mention. The Boeing 777200 business class seat in this route was quite uncomfortable. Specially the leg rest. The cabin crew in my side was very kind and helpful. Onboard breakfast service I think is a little bit mess the service was with fruit service with hot drinks fruit was dislikes second service was cereal croisants and breads and in the third place the main meal. The quality of the food was not really good. The entertaiment system is good tv screen and the headphone. The Boeing 777 aircraft is a little bit noisy but for the 3 hours route is ok.
At the checkin in Vienna the clerk called Air Malta to check if I could travel with my sailing life jacket which contains a 22g CO2 cartridge. He confirmed that Air Malta granted permission for this. I then asked the checkin clerk to confirm with the captain that this was ok. He came back to me say that the captain had given his permission. I flew to Malta and my bag was not on the conveyor on arrival. I found out two days later by sending my wife to Vienna Airport that security in Vienna found the CO2 cartridge and asked Air Malta if they can release it. Air Malta declined and my bag was confiscated. My wife managed to access the bag and after removing my life jacket the bag was flown to Malta. Not only did Air Malta not honour their agreement to carry my bag but they did not inform me of what had happened. To make things worse after trying more than 30 times all day in fact to call Air Malta I did not succeed in getting any information. I was never informed as to what had happened. Without sending someone to Vienna airport at great inconvenience I would never have known what happened to my Bag.
This was the worst experience from Calicut to Cochin with Air India Express. However our flight of 45 min from Calicut to Cochin had a delay of 3 hours for no explicite reason except technical aspects and we missed our 2 next flights with different airlines. Despite explaining the situation to 5 different people nothing was done to help us no refund or help to find new flights. Never fly with Air India Express youre never sure to arrive on time. This is completely unrespectful and not honest at all.
Macau to Da Nang with Jetstar Pacific. The checkin process is a mess. In Da Nang airport they only opened one counter for checkin. It took us almost 2 hours waiting for check in which is totally insane. And the staff didnt understand English. I tried to ask her to call someone to open a new counter but she could only say two words please wait. Worst airline.
I discovered EVA Air at the beginning of the year and yesterday flew with them to Bangkok for the third time. Service has been consistently excellent on the ground and in the air. Living in Geneva I have to transfer and Amsterdam from where EVA flies three times a week is a convenient connection. In brief great value for money. Checking in in Amsterdam is a wellrun operation check in counters open three hours in advance. Online checkin is easy and fast and then it is just a matter of dropping the bag at the Royal Laurel counter. The Aspire lounge for EVA AIR passengers shared with a number of airlines is excellent and now that renovation at Schiphol is progressing also better accessible however it is quite a distance from the usual EVA Air Gate G5. Boarding is orderly and after the preliminaries champagne amenity kit cold towel the plane took off on time. Inflight service is great staff anticipate your needs catering quality high level including the option to choose your meal in advance which I did and I enjoyed a delicious lobster thermidor. Strikingly all cabin staff is female and they are well trained. Friendly service oriented and confident. The staff regularly checks for passengers needs. Flight captains provide useful information. With the great lay out of the cabin I get a good nights sleep and arrived rested in Bangkok 40 minutes ahead of schedule. Business class provides a full size toilet where you can easily change into the pyjamas provided.
Flew roundtrip on Singapore Airlines new nonstop route between San Francisco and Singapore in Premium Economy on the outbound and regular Coach class upon returning. The premium seat was decent but I wasnt as impressed with the rest of the setup or the soft product. With the hard partition toward business class in front and the service area galley located well to the rear past an economy section the premium economy area on this aircraft is a virtual deadend rarely patrolled by flight attendants. On the SFOSIN sector received two meals during the 16h20m flight with no other proactive service no separate drink runs prior to the meals either. You had to press the call button for anything midflight snacks were available but again nothing was offered voluntarily. Flight attendants seemed to do what was required but without a smile. No landing cards handed out. Except for the seat itself the service on the return flight SINSFO in regular Economy was actually better with a prelunch drinks run from a tray not a full cart and followup hot beverage service after the meal. As with the outbound flight however the second meal service a breakfast took place about six hours before landing what gives The checkin experience at SFO was ok but at SIN economy passengers are herded toward self checkin kiosks and self baggage tagging whether they like it or not. I have only flown SIA once before but based on my limited experience with them so far I wouldnt go out of my way to fly them although I would chose them again if they offered a convenient schedule at a decent price point.
It was a comfortable ride. The seats are not bad you get what you pay for. Cabin crews are helpful. Food quality is alright about the same as pre pandemic. Inflight entertainment is mediocre with a limited selections of movies and shows. Still its worth flying with EVA Air if you are planning to fly Taiwan.
Phuket to Koh Samui. Great flight that was absolutely worth the money. The check in airport was very fast and was very friendly. The plane was relatively small but the seat had enough space for such a short flight. In flight there was a free meal which you could choose before on the website. In addition a bottle of water. Free hot drinks such as coffee or tea were also offered on the flight. The flight was very punctual and the crew very nice. I can recommend this airline in any case. Toller Flug der sein Geld absolut Wert war. Das Einchecken man Flughafen ging sehr schnell und war sehr freundlich. Das Flugzeug war zwar relativ klein aber am Sitzplatz hatte man genug Platz fur so einen kurzen Flug. Im Flug gab es ein kostenloses Essen was man sich vorher auf der Website aussuchen konnte. Dazu eine Flasche Wasser. Auf dem Flug wurden ebenfalls kostenlose Heigetranke wie Kaffe oder Tee angeboten. Der Flug war sehr punktlich und die Crew sehr nett. Ich kann diese Fluggesellschaft aufjedenfall weiterempfehlen.
London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018 my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October specifically 1031. Yes thats the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019 coupled with Brexit we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to 800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the 220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers dont charge nearly the high fees and most dont charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA we changed our booking to 1030 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019 because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight. This is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware.
We left Ft. Lauderdale this past December to travel to Guayaquil for a visit with family and friends. The flight was normal as we have traveled this route numerous times. When we arrived in Guayaquil our 12 bags of luggage were not there. After standing in a lost and found line with TAME for about an hour it was explained to us that approx 200 pieces of luggage had been left in Ft. Lauderdale. Their attitude was this happensdeal with it. When I explained that this would require us to buy new clothes toiletries and other items they offered no compensation even though I asked for it. We arrived in Ecuador on Friday the luggage would be delivered to the airport in Guayaquil late Sunday afternoon. The airport in Guayaquil is over 3.5 hours away from where were staying in Ecuador which equates to almost 8 hours to retrieve luggage that should have been there when we landed. They did offer to send it to the Manta airport which is much closer but it would not be there until late Monday. We did finally receive our luggage again no apologies as this seemed to be normal to the TAME employees. The same experience happened to another relative who arrived 5 days later he had to wait a few days to get his luggage after arriving. The new normal for TAME will not be my experience again. We will fly with another carrier.
Due to the pandemic I have been unable to fly with this airline as of yet. My entire experience with this airline and their service dealing with pandemic related issues was the most frustrating and financially costly experience I have ever had with any airline. My family bought tickets to fly out during the spring of 2020 which for obvious reasons fell through. Over the course of the following two years we pursued every possible avenue to receive a refund for those tickets as we were either unable to fly due to pandemic restrictions in the US and New Zealand or in the case of this year members of my family became financially incapable of travel. Even though we reached out many times to make our case for getting out money back so we could travel when everything was safe and we were all financially stable again the airline refused to budge on the issue. I ended up having to call in to their service line to personally address the issue rather than approach it through emails. Even after years of dealing with our tickets being held up in purgatory and our financial situation getting worse the final nail in the coffin came today as I received a 175 phone charge for the 44 minutes I had to be on the phone to get half of my familys money back. After years of dealing with this airline they only chose to refund us a little less than half of the money that we had to contribute and only because that was the money we were forced to pay in order to maintain our tickets the last time the cost went up. We still have thousands of dollars held up in tickets we may never be able to use. Always get fully refundable tickets from this airline do not accept their Disney dollars and do not give them the opportunity to screw you. They do not care about their customers and after I take this flight some time in the next few years whenever my family is financially able to I will never fly with them again. If they would have refunded us the first few times we tried I would happily fly with them again but their terrible customer service and lack of respect for the situations many of their passengers find themselves in during these uncertain times leaves me furious and defeated. I hope to never have to deal with this airline ever again and I am not looking forward to flying with them for my mandatory trip to get rid of my points that I cannot get back.
For 3 years I have been flying with airBaltic and this is the first time I have seen them make money on luggage allowances. They stopped lots of people to check if the hand luggage fit their requirements. Usually mine is ok. This time they asked me for a 60e extra. The price is already expensive how can they pretend to be low cost and have lots of hidden extras. I do not recommend them at all. The only point in travelling with them is that they have the monopoly unfortunately.
I flew on upgraded business class on Qatar Airways from Shanghai to Stockholm via Doha return. What a treat The entire experience was amazing. The service on board is impeccable. You couldnt really compare it to other airlines business class. It is definitely better than BA first class experience. Since my class was an upgraded one I didnt have access to the Al Mourjan lounge at DOH. But I got access to it since the other lounges were full on my first transfer. On my second transfer I purchased access to Al Mourjan 450 QAR 125 USD. It was worth every penny since my layover was more than 5 hours. My last leg Doha to Shanghai was in a Qsuite on a B777. Amazing. I loved it and I loved the service. I cant even imagine how Qatar Airways manages to maintain this level of service. Its really a treat for ones soul and body. Many people complain about the lost access to the Al Mourjan lounge on upgraded tickets. Of course its a shame not to spend the layover at that lounge but considering the quality of the food and drinks you get at that lounge I think QR went back on me paying the 125 USD entrance fee.
I had a wonderful experience flying with Virgin America. The flight was very affordable and was on time. The staff were fun and friendly. I would definitely fly with them again. They had screens on the back of the seats and free videos to select. Very entertaining.
Berlin to Madrid with Iberia Express. Very efficient boarding the crew were making space in the overhead stowage and accompanying passengers to their seats which is very rare in Europe. The flight left Berlin late on a Friday evening most of the passenger were grumpy but the cabin crews have been smiling throughout the flight paying attention to small details. Definitely a great low cost experience.
Flew to DFW from Vancouver one way after attending a wedding. No delays on inbound flight. The flight was smooth with very little turbulence encountered. Kudos to American Airlines flight crew. They were polite and friendly. Premium Economy seat had enough legroom for a comfortable flight. Service is typical biscotti snack and soft drinks of all domestic flights. American does a pretty good job of getting you were you want on their domestic and trans border flights.
Dublin Bodrum Dublin 9th June. Delayed 1hr but pilot made good time. A fairly new plane nice crew. All in all a pleasant journey going and coming. Just one gripe quite expensive on board for food and drinks.
Flight home after a 2 week break in various parts of Europe. The cabin crew were fantastic. Made us me and my Australian companions very welcome and were most accommodating throughout our flight home. Cannot fault the service.
I enjoyed the flight. There was a slight delay but arrival time was only slightly delayed. Despite the Easter Rush on Good Friday check in was easy. The snacks offered for the flight was minimal but not too bad for a 2 hour flight. Free beer was much appreciated. Staff were friendly.
Very good service. Punctual and reliability. Staffs are well trained and also friendly to all passengers. Food and service are good. I generally use Thai smile for works every week or two depending on Covid situation especially for meeting on one day trip from my hometown to Bangkok. It is so convenient.
My mom and I flew from Boise to Seattle for a little vacation get away for the 4th of July. We left on 73 from Boise on a one hour straight flight to Seattle. When we arrived we discovered that some how my mothers luggage had been lost. Im not sure how that can possibly happen on such an easy flight. We had to wait at the Delta baggage claim for 3 12 hours for them to finally tell us they would open a case. They had no idea where my moms bag was. Our plan was to fly into Seattle get a rental car and drive about 2 12 hours away to Ocean Shores. This put us way behind schedule and left my mom with NOTHING no clothes no toothbrush no heart medication. She trusted that Delta would get her bag to its location. For Petes sake we werent taking an international flight with layovers The next morning Delta called and said they located my moms bag but that they couldnt deliver it to us because we were too far away and they couldnt ship it via UPS because it was a holiday. By the time Delta would have been able to ship my moms bag to us we would have already been returning to the airport at the end of our short vacation. My mom paid to check her bag both ways 60 just to not have any access to it plus the stress of not knowing where it was waiting for hours and the inconvenience of having none of the items that she brought to accommodate her vacation. She had to spend about 150 of replacement clothes toothbrush etc. I contacted Delta after the trip and requested nothing other than that they refund the 60 we paid to check the bag both ways. They would only offer a flight credit good for 12 months.... UNBELIEVABLE. We will not be flying in 12 months so I again asked for a cash refund instead. They refused. This type of customer service in any other industry would make a company go out of business.
Flew from Aberdeen to Esbjerg 03022015 flight was delayed 45min because of snow and deicing the aircraft not BMI fault made up some time just offered a drink no food. Flight back 06022015 was on time flight only had 20 people on it snacks in a box and drink were served. All in all good flight bit expensive but my company was paying for it.
Singapore to Jakarta on board Boeing 737900ER. The check in process is smooth and the staff is kind. The cabin crew was nice. However The flight was delayed for around more than 45 minutes due to late arrival of aircraft from Jakarta. Overall it is good journey with Lion Air despite the delay.
Gatwick to Montego Bay return and a satisfying journey with Thomson Airways. Aircraft on the way to MBJ was very clean and modern. Staff are very kind and helpful when you need them to be. Only negative aspect is the inflight entertainment is very poor with only a handful of movies. Food is okay just like any airline meal. Handling in MBJ is very slow to get through immigration. On the return leg a different plane as it was less modern but still comfortable but hard to get to sleep. Plane was delayed due to tropical rainstorm at MBJ with nothing to do but it was not Thomsons fault you cant help the weather. On the way back there was inflight entertainment but no headphones so had to ask for them Ground handling in LGW was okay. Altogether not a bad experience with Thomson.
Dallas to Bangalore return via Dubai. When i booked my ticket on the Emirates website it was clearly mentioned that the Dallas flights would be on their A380 aircraft. I was excited to fly on Emirates and try out their new amenities in the Business cabin including the bar and space to move around. However on the day of the journey I find out that instead of the A380 the aircraft was now a Boeing 777300ER. A much smaller plane. Instead of the spacious and luxurious Business cabin they had changed our seats it was now 232 with some of the business seats having no direct aisle access. I was in the window seat so was stuck trying to get to the aisle on both legs of my journey. The seats seemed a bit worn out the IFE control a bit heavy and clunky and it was not a lieflat seat which on such a long journey is a huge problem. I hated the trip and felt completely let down. If they had not indicated that this was going to be a A380 I would never have flown with them and given them my money. Emirates then did an about face when I contacted them via email saying its well within their rights to change equipment and not inform passengers Really for all their big hue and cry of looking out for passengers its pretty obvious that they could not care less. Not even a decent apology for pulling the old bait and switch and then feigning ignorance.
Bucharest to Dubai via Istanbul and back. The flight from Bucharest to Istanbul was ok only 55 minutes time but they provided snacks and drinks which is wonderful considering the flight time. Istanbul to Dubai on Boeing 777300er new plane and excelent cabin crew they served dinner and beverages. The flight was on time. On the return leg Dubai to Istanbul the aircraft was Airbus A330300 with a 242 configuration which was better for us. The plane was a bit older than the previous one but the entertaining system was ok plenty of choices to watch. Cabin crew were wonderful you can tell that they are hard working and also very professional. The only inconvenient is Ataturk airport because it is too crowded there are a lot of flights departing and landing at the same time and you have to spend a lot of time in the aircraft untill take off and also after landing which causes delays. There werent any problems with the luggage but I think that the ground staff that handles the luggage should be more careful as the suitcases came a little bit damaged after the flights. I saw that they are throwing them quite hard when handling. All in all I would recommend Turkish Airlines.
Los Angeles to Bangkok via Hong Kong. I purchased a ticked from an online travel agency and none of the seat selections was respected even though the receipt showed them as confirmed. For online checkin instead of using the name and locator number they require the ticket number which was not on the agency confirmation. The lounge in LAX was mediocre. On the LAX to Hong Kong leg the hard product cabinseat at first glance looked quite comfortable enough. The soft product was of vastly inferior quality. The seat was dirty crumbs on the seat and stains on the armrest. The service was uncoordinated and slow. The bread came after the main course. The drinks were poured once and any further request for either a refill or more water was only brought after a long wait or a reminder. The wifi was unusable. One could see the network but there was never a connection. Getting seats assigned on the return portion was impossible at airport checkin on the outbound and could only be done 24 hours prior to the last segment departure not 24 hours before the first segment departure as is standard. A call to their customer service line resulted in I cannot open the seat map. There is a lot of competition on these routes and Im sorry to say for the price this is the worst option.
Two friends independently booked flights for 9th October online. The website automatically moved the flights to 10th October without telling us because the 9th was unavailable. We only became aware that they had done so when we received the booking confirmations. Immediately we called the call centre who refused to cancel or refund the flight so we have lost our money. I contacted them through Twitter but they continued to blame us refusing to accept that the website had automatically moved it. We are both not stupid people and would not have independently made the same mistake but that is what is implied. We have lost our money for both flights through no fault of our own. Customer service is awful. To clarify we did not take the flights so I cannot comment on ground service seat comfort etc.
I am writing a separate review for this return trip because I would like to express huge gratitude to the Loganair ground staff at Kirkwall. Never felt so silly in my flying career but I managed to book a return flight for a wrong date and found this out only at the checkin counter. What I would like to outline is not the fact that I was eventually rebooked on an earlier flight had a FlexPlus fare so it was assumed but how the staff cared. The initial morning flight had to be delayed and aircraft promptly replaced for a smaller one due to crew sickness the ground staff had to manage 80 passengers most of whom went on vacation with families and were missing their flight connections they resolved the situation very efficiently I assume it is not easy to find alternative flights when flying out from a small island in the middle of nowhere known for an awful weather and remained kind during the process. And in the middle of this all the checkin manager found me out from the crowd in the departure hall and personally presented me with a new boarding pass thus solving my own mess in addition to the problems they had on the plate. Amazing job and great example for many regional operations Cherry on top the flight great as well with a very lovely crew.
Singapore to London via Dubai. Ek353 from Singapore to Dubai night flight very attentive service. The next sector ek001 Dubai to London no cabin crew walking all disappear after the service. Glasgow to Dubai on an old A380 IFE there is a crack line service attendant was good but when leaving plane the hand baggage door above our seat unable to open cabin crew assisted us in opening the door. Very helpful staff on Ek028 from Dubai to Singapore unfriendly service rude people not so friendly never walk around with drinks after food service just couldnt be bordered. Overall it is a mixed bag but for the price will fly with them.
Boston to London. World Traveler seats. Nice headrest. Legroom okay but overall very cramped especially when the passenger in front reclines hisher seat. The seat back was almost in my lap making it impossible to read British Airways magazine or even use my iPad. We ordered special meals Halal and low sodium. The Muslim meal chicken tikka masala with naan was restaurant quality. Flavorful and not spicy hot. The gulab jamun dessert was also restaurant quality and just like moms. The low sodium meal herb roasted chicken tomato rice petite broccoli diced red pepper and carrots was delicious. Dessert consisted of fresh blueberries and blackberries. The IFE was very good. Bright and clear LED screens with a good selection of entertainment and movies in several languages.
I used to be the biggest fan of Aeromexico. The staff was amazing professional courteous and very friendly and still are with the obvious exceptions mentioned below. Unfortunately our recent trip leaves us questioning whether or not we will ever risk using their services again. If you have or have traveled with someone with a disability you know how important it is that boarding the aircraft be done in an organized manner. Those that have issues health age children etc need that little extra time before regular boarding commences. Its not meant to be a freeforall. Well not unless you board your Aeromexico AM flight out of the satellite Mexico City airport NLU Santa Lucia. NLU is a relatively brand new airport opened March 2022 and it appears that the AM staff has yet to be trained on basic procedures. We had 2 bad experiences in NLU. The first was flying in on the way to Veracruz and the second was the return trip out. While the first flight was total chaos we were fortunate enough that several of the gentlemen at the front of the line saw that my husband was an amputee etc and immediately waved us to the front. While this was disorganized it wasnt the mess that the return flight out of NLU was. The second flight NLU to Guadalajara was a nightmare. There was absolutely no control over the passengers. When it was time to board there were no zones or even basic preboarding. AM had a group of 2030 who appeared to be traveling together not young disabled etc who were let on first. We were about halfway in the line. There was no Premier boarding one of the benefits that AM promises its passengers who pay a bit more. Nope it was a cluster eff freeforall. Oh silly my. I forgot to mention not only does my 76yearold amputee husband need the special boarding but WE WERE also PAYING PREMIER PRICES for the early boarding. We didnt get it. So we finally get to our seats and watched as there was no control as the passengers boarded. Several economy passengers just casually jammed their stuff in the Premier overhead bins. Result Hubby had problems with his carryon which had his meds and which came off badly scuffed. Please understand I realize that space is limited on flights but if you pay for certain benefits you should get those benefits. We did not. I wrote to complain and got the stand too bad so sad letter in return. I had asked for compensation. Of course thats not going to happen. No I wasnt looking for a free flight or reimbursement of our tickets. As my girl Judge Judy says we ate the steak. What I was looking for was a small compensation to acknowledge that they did not deliver as promised. Instead I got a form letter that any trained lizard could and did write. We will look elsewhere in the future and heartily recommend that you do the same.
Phuket to Melbourne via Kualar Lumpur. Barely existent customer service and their seats are so cramped making a long haul flight a nightmare. The lights are on for a good chunk of the flight making it difficult to get any shuteye. They have a nonsensical policy that phones must be turned off for takeoff and landing not switched to flight mode but turned off and they enforce it. Prior to booking there was an issue with the booking and trying to speak to their customer service left me fuming. Their Australian contact number was engaged on the 10 times I tried to call it. To chat with them online you have to get past their online bot which is a real pain when it doesnt understand your problem. The person I spoke to was absolutely rude and unhelpful. The chat closes after 60 seconds of inactivity which is infuriating when you have to go off and find information.
I recently took a trip to Srinagar and on my way back lost my phone at the airport just a while before the boarding. I panicked to find my phone everywhere which was noted by one of the Vistara airport staff named tabasshum who without any questions helped us look for our phone. Another of the airport staff member Suhaib also helped us a lot to find our phone. Both of these members helped us incredibly and sent us our phone back to Mumbai within 24hrs. They were constantly in touch with us till we got our phone and helped us with all the formalities procedures to get the phone. We are very grateful to to both Vistara airlines and specially grateful to these to staff members Suhaib and Tabasshum from Srinagar airport. We really appreciate these kind efforts. And wish to fly again with vistara airlines.
Based on all the reviews I was prepared for the worst. Being a regular Spirit customer my bar for airlines is extremely low. But they had real seatback pockets their seats reclined and were actually very comfortable they had free movies nice attendants a free mediocre meal clean bathrooms. I couldnt have asked for more Got me from A to B without making me feel like cattle.
London to Singapore. I was apprehensive about flying BA Club World after reading many negative reviews. I was however surprised. Firstly they are not on part with SQ or QR but to be fair I found them to be one of the most reasonably priced offerings. You get what you pay for. The seat while old is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space. The window seats are best for privacy. I am tall and had no issues sleeping. In fact I slept for almost 7 hours. The service and food out of London was top notch fresh and plentiful which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on Qantas. Service was consistent polite and very attentive. Drinks and water continually topped up. I was truly impressed The return flights service was very average and quite sloppy but lets focus on the positives
Delhi to Cologne via Istanbul. I have flown with almost all the airlines but never came across a total unprofessional staff such as of Turkish airlines. Delay of 6 hours from Delhi but they did not bother to tell us. Then I missed my connection and they made me to buy EVisa they promised but never refunded the money. While returning another delay from Cologne and another missed connection. Another E Visa and my money was wasted one more time. I have seen staff of all airlines standing at the gates and guiding people for connecting flight. But Turkish airlines staff doesnt believe in this. When I landed in Istanbul after a delay I still had 40 minutes before the departure gates were closed. I found no one to guide us to follow the correct gate. I saw people running with their luggage children along with me. Istanbul is one big airport and we had to walk all the way from one end to another to reach our boarding gate. Deboarding searching for the gate number and then running all over took 30 mins. And we all missed our flight to Delhi. A long queue to buy EVisa because they wouldnt accommodate you in any other plane. Money wasted a day wasted and then speaking to actually a mannerless staff of Turkish airlines. I cant do anything I dont fly the plane and you shouldnt have come to Istanbul if youre so angry this was the standard response from most of their ground staff. They made us to run from one place to another with no support of any kind. All they told us to buy Visa and go to hotel.
Qassim to Jeddah. The flight suppose to depart at 1550 it was delayed while we are waiting inside to get Into the plane and they told us the new time is 1855 Hrs We waited inside Airport after checked in for 230 hrs and once the gate opened they took first 150 passengers and canceled all remaining tickets. Of course without any refund. It is very obvious that they overbook the flight . When we talked to the available staff at the gate he said I cant do any thing and he was very unpleasant person to talk with. I had to pay additional SAR 450 and fly back by Saudi airlines only available and remaining next flight . I hope the airline authorities stop this kind of practices not allowed any airline to do that to their customers. I do not recommend any person to travel with Flyadeal the worst travel experience ever.
My cousin flew on a flight from Barcelona to Geneva and at some point we realized it got redirected. We called their customer service line which is designed to be fully automated and once I finally got in contact with an actual person and asked if they have any information on my cousins flight they wanted to know the flights number. I dont memorize these numbers so I asked him to wait while I find it. He graciously waited 30 seconds. 30 seconds of waiting and then he tells me that if I dont have the number then he will have to hang up in order to serve other customers. After saying that he doesnt wait for my response tells me to kindly do a survey and hangs up the phone. I understand that there are other customers I understand that there will be other people calling this airline to find out about their friends or family that were on the same flight as my cousin but I cannot believe that 30 seconds was too much of a wait time. This airline may provide cheap fares but their customer service is so poor you really shouldnt expect anything.
Gatwick to Barbados with euroAtlantic Airways. Possibly the worst flight I have ever experienced. We took off late from Gatwick for unknown reasons we were never told why and then the Captain announced the flight would take over 10 hours for journey other airlines do in just over 8hrs. Seat pitch was terrible we had to wait over 3 hours for lunch served at 1530 there was insufficient water on board to ensure that we all got something to drink throughout the flight warm beer was offered to me at one stage they ran out of food but had some sandwiches 40 hours old so they told us. The crew were totally disinterested the inflight loop IFE system showed only a superhero type film to a passenger cohort in their 60s and then a film in Portuguese to an English speaking audience. I can think of nothing good to say about this flight other than that we arrived.
I flew London to Beijing in Club World on BA039 on Aug 7. The cabin was a disgrace. I sat in the upper deck seat 62A and what worried me was the filthy window the metallic looking tape on the emergency exit door and the foam strip that was hanging down. In addition the carpet and lockers were filthy inside. Food and service were excellent but I will vote with my wallet and boycott BA from now on wherever possible.
Las Vegas to London Heathrow. This particular Boeing 747400 must have been one resurrected from storage in the desert. The condition of this aircraft was appalling. The First Class cabin was literally falling apart with loose yellowed bins and filthy carpets. The entertainment system was old and slow and low definition. The Premium Economy cabin was directly behind First Class and those passengers kept using the First Class toilets. It didnt matter because they were filthy. The dinner in First Class was inedible. British Airways are now a national embarrassment. British Airways are at best a three star airline and maybe even a two star carrier compared to their competitors.
Thiruvananthapuram to Doha was a wonderful journey with Qatar Airways. Service was beyond the expectation even though i was a traveller from economy but it was a first class service.
ATL to LHR Boeing 777 Economy. Ive just returned from a family holiday in the USA and flew BA Economy. The flight was slightly delayed but most of this delay was made up during the journey. Staff were pleasant and the IFE was fine. However the food was terrible. Main meal was a choice of Chicken Curry and Rice or a Veggie Pasta. Breakfast before landing was a cold box consisting of a Croissant bag of Cranberries and a Granola Bar. What has happened to the 2 meat choices Veggies choose veggie option in advance and a cooked breakfast BA have a British flag on the tail but do not serve any British food. Im a Silver Executive Club member and food on BA has been deteriorating over the last couple of years. Ive made several complaints.
BA continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service provided by people who shouldnt be in customer service on tired dirty and cramped aircraft. Out of 11 flights this year not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations ontime. Including having 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered still no refunds 3 months on and had a flight late and missed connection so BA cancelled the rest of my ticket leaving me stranded in the US.
First leg JROFRA boarding process was a mess and disorganized. Business class Only one person at the gate checking boarding passes. Flat bed not comfortable. No rest rooms in the front of plane. Two restrooms that were shared with economy comfort and occupied. Second leg FRA LAX again same issue with boarding. Business class only one person at gate checking boarding passes and everyone pushing to try to get through. No orderly queue. Flat bed more comfortable because there was a mattress pad. In general one of the worst airlines that I have used and will not fly Lufthansa again.
London Heathrow to Hong Kong with British Airways on theirn A380. I have had more legroom seatspace on a 2 hour holiday charter flight to Spain. Dont know why I had to endure such a cramped position for 12 hrs. Then to top it all im sorry sir we havent got any breakfast left. Not a happy chappie. Return journey same cramped conditions. For a long haul flight I would not recommend BA.
A huge disaster. We bought a tickets with relatively comfortable connection of an hour and 45 minutes. The airline changed the time of the flight to 30 minutes later so we were left with a connection of 40 minutes. My father who was flying with me is 85 years old. I called the airline in Italy saying that my father is 85 and asking to be changed to an earlier flight from Palermo or a later flight from Rome. Both flights exist but the airline wanted to charge me for the change. They told me to try through Travelocity the site through which we bought the tickets. Travelocity wrote an email to the airline explaining the special circumstances but the airline refused again. The day of the flight we explained the situation to the agent at the check in counter she said the only thing she could do to help was give us both boarding passes and requested special assistance to be able to change flights faster. We asked to be placed in seats closer to the exit she refused. She did not know the gate for the second flight. When we got to the plane we told one of the flight assistants and she just said they would wait for us and the flight was on time. The flight was delayed 40 minutes exactly the time we had for our connection. When we landed the flight assistant asked for the people who had asked for special assistance to stay seated until everybody had disembarked. Of course we could not wait. We ran to find out on a monitor our gate because no one helped us although we asked for help to several ITA employees. When we got to the gate no one was there we thought it had left because I got to the door to check if it was closed. Suddenly a very grumpy ITA employee did not ask if we needed help and just started to scream at us why we were at the door. I explained and she did not say that the flight was delayed she just continued scolding. After a while she said the flight was delayed. Then she called us from the counter and asked why we had requested special assistance because this assistance is only for people who cannot move. I explained we asked for assistance to change flights faster because the connection was tight not because we cannot move and that we did not wait for it because it did not make sense that we had to hurry but we had to wait until all passengers disembark. We will never fly with ITA Airways again. We travel a lot and I had never encounter such a disorganized airline. Actually it is the first time I take te time to write a bad review of an airline. The worts.
A very cramped journey from Bali to Dubai in economy with barely any space to put my feet and I am only 5 ft 2. The pilot was very communicative about passing tropical weather and the air hostess were lovely. With just a 1 hour transit in Dubai I hopped onto the A380 which is much bigger but the walkways are still soo mall. The air hostess on this flight were not as friendly. A particular air hostess kept telling me off because I crossed my legs and my foot slightly went onto the aisle I mean we were so squished. I fell asleep and they didnt serve me the first meal or even offer a drink when I woke up they just past me as if I didnt exist. The second meal was an excellent portion size the food could barely fit on the tray. I particularly liked the greek yoghurt and granola and cheese and biscuits for the hot food it wasnt impressive. I had better food on cheaper airlines. The air hostess were OK about re filling my water bottle. All in all I think I would try another airline for this long journey next time just a few bad vibes from the staff with regards to meals and sleeping as mentioned above.
Flew this airline for the first time from Manila to Tokyo Narita roundtrip ticket. I get that its a budget airline but it was disappointing. In my opinion when you add the budget fare with addons such as bags bags are only 1 piece 20kg youre paying even more than you would a 5star airline where there is at least 1 free checked bag 23kg. The ground staff were friendly enough. The boarding passes were printed on receiptlike paper a cost cutting measure I dont really mind. While waiting at the gate there was no announcement that the gate had changed. There was just a sign facing away from us indicating where the new gate was. Good thing my group saw a friend on the same flight who had checked in much later and we found out that they had a different gate printed. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable. The cabin crew were fine.
Billund to Delhi via Istanbul. On 29th July our travel from Billund via Istanbul was delayed by 24 hours due to heavy delay in first flight which resulted in missing next fligh.t We stuck at Istanbul airport with family and could not go out as we did not had working international credit card to get EVisa. We had US Dollars in cash but there was no system at Istanbul airport to pay for EVisa in cash. This resulted us spending 24 hours at airport with family and 1 year old baby. It was one of the worst experience we had. Ground staffs at Istanbul airport were very uncooperative.
Paris to Minsk. This is probably the worst airline Ive ever used. The seats are ok but other than that everything is an absolute nonsense. Ive never seen this rude staff ever in my life Worst nightmare it could be. Customer service is real awful cant even describe it with words the flight can make you feel like crying.
La Paz to Rurrenabaque. Avoid will cancel flights and move you onto other flight times without any contact. We arrived at airport to find both legs had been cancelled and we were on different flight times which meant a complete change of plans and additional costs incurred. They claimed not to have contact details despite us proving we had provided these as they had contacted us to confirm booking and provide tickets via email. Check in staff will also just shrug their shoulders and will not even provide an apology. Make sure you reconfirm your flight the day before but be warned at the check in desk they reserve he right to cancel change flights up to 2 hours before with no warning or refund
This is the third time I have used Korean for my transpacific flight. I just want to say that for economy class the extra inch or so of leg room they have is such a comfort compared to other airlines that ply the same route. The service is stellar and the meals are fairly good as well.
Florence to London City. Very unpleasant experience my first and only time flying with Cityjet. The flight was delayed due to weather which ok it happens Then it was diverted but arrangements were made and eventually we made it to City airport. The most unpleasant of the flight was the lost luggage and the poor service afterwards. Nothing was told to me appart from the numerous times I contacted the company and they said they didnt know what happened. After one month I have no luggage and no response from the company Thats not the way to treat customers and I felt very upset. This was not a low cost flight and the quality of the service was far below any low cost I ever did.
New Haven to Myrtle Beach. Avelo changed our flight never notified us and I only found out because I couldnt check into my flight. I called and waited almost 2 hours to connect to someone to be told our flight was moved to the day before and we werent sent an email never got one. Checked every junk spam folder etc nothing. So Avelo sends me a screen shot of the email confirmation with the departure and arrival date for that flight as the original date I had booked not the one they changed it too Over a month now and can barely talk to anyone lost 1200 on an emergency flight home because Avelo couldnt get us out for another 2 days I believe it was. Customer service has been a nightmare hours on hold and just hanging up giving up. Getting connected and transferred around and no one able to Help because its someone elses issue who deals with it. Going on hearing from a manager for a week And a half Now no reply to Email sent by me twice or call. Wrote again today see what happens. The flight crew was an absolute gem its too bad the rest ruined our time with Avelo. Maybe someone out there will Help me change our tune to Avelo by out there I mean the airline actually trying to rectify the issue they created and are responsible for. Ill even take that call from a manger Ive been waiting a week and a half for. Update two weeks later the manager finally reached out and has been no help whatsoever claims theres nothing wrong on their end and will not give me their information to help my email company. See if those emails ever came through their domain. The absolute worst customer service I have ever seen or dealt with. the worst part is theres reviews online that same issue. I had pretty much to a T and when that was brought up they stated good to know we will look into it. But according to me they dont make mistakes only us people having the same problem multiple times.
Flew many times with Lao Airlines mostly on time. The seats are comfortable and onboard service good. Just the tickets sometimes are expensive for very short routes but competitors are missing.
BA2262 on 17th Feb 2014. I was in 4A from Jamaica to London Gatwick and no need to climb over anyones legs and youre close to the toilet and the galley were your can help yourself. Seat is very good and good space. Great meal I had the Chicken Curry very good and a nice bottle of wine to help it down. The Stewards were very helpful. Going to Grenada soon and see they have first on the flight so going to try that.
I am a member of Myjet2 after several good flights with this company. I attempted to reserve 2 return seats from Edinburgh to Funchal in March 2020 following receipt of a special offer from Myjet2. After several attempts to book flights for my wife and I I received on each occasion a message advising me that an unexpected error had occurred. Eventually after several unanswered emails I called Jet2 Customer Services and was advised that following a change to regulations at the start of the year my email address had been blocked for future bookings and that I should change my email address. I asked why if this was the case why I was constantly receiving emails from Jet2 promoting their services. The lady had no answer for this In addition if this was the case why did Jet2 not advise me of this situation I am now in the position whereby despite wishing to take advantage of Myjet2 offers I am unable to book flights. What a shambolic organisation this is. Any response from their so called Customer Services operations seems to take forever if at all.
The worst customer service experience with any airline so far coming from someone who has visited almost 40 countries with both budget and business class airlines. Flight cancelled less than 24 hours before departure spent more than 4 hours on the phone with different representatives trying to get a boarding pass for a replacement ticket and only went in circles with their staff.
This is the worst company we have ever used so far. There was a delay of more than 25 hours immediately in Tampa then we lost the plane in Frankfurt that was going to Zagreb. No one wanted to help us in Frankfurt it took us 25 hours to find right shelter to get a new plane tickets and then we have to wait almost 6 hours until the second flight and all this not our fault. There was not enough food on the plane especially drinks. You always had to ask and it took a long time to be served. They charged if someone wanted a blanket because it was cold. I will make sure that I never fly with this company again.
Vizag to Delhi and my experience was not pleasant. I booked international baggage and additional Baggage along with VIP for all 3 passengers. Other PNR only VIP. When I booked I had questions about baggage allowance showing 45kgs per passengers so called customer service Twice for clarification and suggestion for carrying 60kg per passenger. With the answers provided I was convinced and proceeded with the same. When i reached the airport at the check in counter the staff informed me that my luggage is overweight and i need to pay initially i was trying to explain whats my understanding from customer service rep of airasia immediately i was cut off by the line manager standing there in suit saying how can you believe customer service guys and you must know. When I responded that i have call records he said ok lets play them now and listen to check in. When i was trying to play the record he again cut me off saying what exactly is my problem as i should be aware of baggage allowance policy and started laughing with his colleague. This was very insulting in front of my family as they felt very embarrassed to be treated like novice flyers. I responded saying I will deal with this later let me get checked in and paid the extra money and while leaving the line manager along with other staff were murmuring and laughing. Soon one of the staff approached me looking that we were upset saying sir we will do what we can do to raise a service note of what happened here and apologised and left.
Travel through Qatar has been very smooth and it was extra special during these times. Very clean airport and aircraft super courteous staff. Good food and nice choices of meals. The Qatar app is an added bonus. I really like the baggage notifications that reassures the status of your baggage.
Flew London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. We have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in British Airways. The service on this flight was appalling. Travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin services i.e. drinks towels etc.. the normal routine stuff. On too many occasions we had to request attention. Chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2 at the front of the service. Collection of waste items had to be requested. The galley kitchen was not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of water. Cabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flight. Hot towels will soon be the size of a postage stamp. Toilet bags are cheap. BA have totally lost the plot. They are no longer a premium service and Willie Walsh and Co. need to take a flight on Emirates Qatar etc. to realise their failings. Business seating configuration is ridiculous. Passengers in the centre seats have to hurdle their way to the isle over the isle passengers legs. As part of the same trip we made domestic flights to connect. Again service is in reverse but the costs arent. If BA wants to become a budget airline then they need to offer budget fares. I dont think they have a clue what they are doing. In future we will avoid them unless absolutely necessary. The only positive of the trip was the lounge at Gatwick. The lounge at San Jose is a joke.
Gran Canaria to Madrid. From start to finish I felt like there was so many problems. Firstly I arrived at the airport early so I didnt have to leave my baggage in the hold. However everyone who was priority was allowed on before. They put people into groups so I was group 3 the last even though I was the first near the gate. After that my luggage was put into hold. Once on the flight the staff seemed disconnected and also flustered themselves I suppose because things dont run smooth. The back of my seat was broken so I had to be transferred next to a mother and small baby crying at this point I just wanted to rest. The food and drinks were overpriced and I had to pay 2.50 for a tea which was that bad I had to ask for it to be changed. The hot water was not warm enough to brew the tea so it ended up looking like dirty dishes water. At the other end of the flight I waited over 20 mins to get off the plane and then a further half an hour to get my bag which was only very small. Not a comfortable experience in total and wouldnt think of flying again with them. easyJet is a much better option for low cost.
Jetstar cancelled my flight 3 hours before schedule. My flight was morning flight so I was booked a taxi in the early morning. So disappointed.
Dubai to Paris. The service in economy class has gone down. There could be not enough staff but they seem to be in a rush to go at the back and chat together. they dont seem dedicated to their work. Breakfast served 3 hours before arrival which for a night flight means no sleep. Could be again a question of understaffed if not training in customer service.
We flew SilkAir from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on May 7th. Newspaper given on aircraft comfortable seats for my wife and I near wing. Attentive crew refreshing towels handed out. A short flight nearing Kuala Lumpur we struck turbulance causing the plane to drop slightly. The flight attendants immediately sat in seats in front of us staying there until we landed No announcement from flight deck. Overall a great flight clean plane good service Our return flight to Singapore was on May 16th. Once again a good flight short no complaints We enjoyed this airline and we would fly with them again.
I was flying to Warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to Miami the next day. Initially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hours. As such I knew I would miss my connection in Warsaw. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty I was in economy I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 23 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami. BA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I can retrieve it from there. I mean the bag is sitting in Heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to Warsaw yet BA in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to Warsaw before I leave for Miami the next day.
I have not actually flown on Silver Airways. My family were scheduled to fly last April which of course was the beginning of the real shut downs on travel. Obviously things were going on that following up on the ticket was not top of mind. In November I had enough bandwidth to go back to revisit. At first I was told it had been refunded and was sent a receipt with the date of refund and the CC that I had paid it on. After some research I found it had not been refunded. I then emailed guest relations as another avenue since I was not getting anywhere with the initial rep and asked what was going on. I was told via email that the money had actually been put in a travel bank with a user ID to login and check. After multiple attempts at requesting a password to no avail I called back to find out what was going on since the date I was hoping to travel was fast approaching. The rep on the phone discovered that the User ID I had been provided was in fact not me. Days pass and Im given a new User ID and successfully manage to log into the travel bank only to see that there was nothing in it. I ask what the status is once again through email and am told it should be resolved in the next few days. Three days after the date I was told it would be resolved by there is still nothing in my travel bank and the prices keep going up beyond the value of my former ticket which if they had done this correctly in the first place would have been covered by my balance. Now it is looking like I have to cancel the trip again because of their incompetence. I dont have my money and I dont have a flight. Its appalling. Im actually trying to book another ticket with them lawd knows why but I cant even do that. And sadly they are the only player to the destination. So now my travel plans are ruined thanks to them. They also cancelled my sisters flight that she had managed to rebook without another option so she may also be screwed.
Manchester to Malta A319 22nd December 2014. Checkin was slow which was a bad start and it got worse. Our economy seats had minimal legroom and when the passenger in front put his seat back just after takeoff I was trapped. There was no entertainment system other than a map showing the planes location and the meal of chicken curry with a bread roll and tiny mince pie was embarrassingly poor. For a scheduled flight it was pretty bad and the best bit was leaving the plane on arrival at Luqa.
Rwandair cancelled and rescheduled our flights multiple times and did not reissue our tickets which made it difficult for operating carrier ET to find us in the system and check us in. After RW assured us that they have fixed our tickets they again made changes to our returning flight from Kigali to Addis without informing us. We purchased a direct flight from Kigali to Addis departing at 1620 and without informing us prior they changed the flight to 1515 one hour earlier with a stop in Bujumbura. When we arrived at the Kigali airport Rwanda airline representatives were not transparent with us about the stop in Bujumbura and the change of the flight times. When we wanted to receive some answers about the flight time changes and the sudden stop in Bujumbura the airport staff became rude and tried blaming us for this situation this discussion took place at 1509 and they seriously wanted us to proceed through security and immigration when the departure time was 1515. When I asked them if the aircraft is still there and if it will wait for us they did not give me an answer. Hence we were not able to board the flight because of their failure to inform us about the flight cancellation and rescheduling incredibly enough they did not want to take responsibility and in all seriousness told us that we had to purchase a new ticket for 900 per person After holding us at the airport for 9 hours without eating and drinking we spoke with airport security who finally decided that the airline was in the wrong and pressured the Rwandair staff to put us on a new flight which was their responsibility all along. Rwanda Air is incredibly incompetent and unprofessional in providing customer support and service and have absolutely no training in how to treat their customers. Throughout our nine horrific hours at the airport we were harassed by Rwandair staff and called liars who wanted to miss our flight by the head of Customer Relations himself. They put us into an incredibly bad situation and took no responsibility until they were forced to by airport security. In addition they lost our luggage it never left Mumbai and it is nowhere to be found which still has not arrived in Addis. Do not take this airline because you do not want to be stuck in their hands when they make mistakes and are unwilling to correct them. Simply a horrific experience.
On our honeymoon to SA we flew Kulula from Durban to Cape Town. Friendly and very helpful BAstaff in Durban asking if Id like to have an exit seat being 67ft this is usually the seat I am sitting in. It takes a while to get used to the bright green interior and the green shirts and blue jeans of the cabin crew but service was friendly sandwiches were tasty and prices for the snacks were moderate. Flight took almost two hours and crew offered trolley services twice. Baggage was delivered within five minutes after arrival in CPT. I would choose that cool airline again next time it is refreshingly different
Excellent entertainment system on both the shorthaul and the longhaul leg. This was what really impressed me about the subsidiary Dragon Airlines operated the first leg and the parent company Cathay Pacific operated the longhaul leg. Otherwise the service was average in my opinion Ok crew but seemed that they were rather just doing their job. The possibility to go and get snacks during the flight at the rear of the plane was nice there were many things to choose from. Cathay also profits from Hongkong airport being a very serviceable and attractive hub for connecting flights with lots to see and do.
Although there were 9 passengers waiting in the airport the airline closed the registration leaving these passengers with no support for the weekend. No available solutions the only answer I get after two days of complete silence I am not covered by any kind of support.
I flew with two friends on Firefly from Penang to Kota Bharu. The service on board was excellent welcoming staff and a light snack cookies and drink. This is a good airline and I do highly recommend. A snack with a drink were serving during a 50 flight. Bravo and please go on with a dedicated customer service
EasyJet lost my bag. I had to fill an online form for lost baggage. They gave updates on the bag status for 3 weeks. Post that the status was removed. No compensation was paid. The airline staff was helpful at the airport however they were Ill treated by various contracted service providers of easyJet. Besides this the airport facilities provided by easyJet are horrible. One has to check in ones luggage at the checkin. The instructions on the checking machines are inadequate. These machines fail to scan the bar codes on the boarding passes. The only relief is good and helpful staff but the numbers are too low.
Toronto to New York with TAM Airlines and overall satisfied with the service provided. I used TAM given their competitive price baggage allowance and reluctance to use Air Canada. The flights were on time 1 hour flight time each way. Comfortable seating in Economy with a small snack service. Impressed with the cleanliness of the cabin and newness of aircraft. Speedy delivery of luggage at both airports. One thing I did not understand is why they wait so long to depart when everyone is seated and cargo hold closed. The cabin was a bit on the cool side as several people put on their jacket. I plan to use them again for my subsequent nyc trips.
I was on an Aer Lingus flight operated by Cityjet. My flight was late due to weather in London and my original flight got cancelled but I got put onto a flight 55 minutes later. The flight itself was OK. The seats on this little Avro are very cramped. Cityjet uses a 33 configuration instead of the standard 32. This makes the seats very thin and leaves you with not much room. The inflight catering was provided by Aer Lingus and featured a buy on board service. As this was a morning flight I opted for a Hot chocolate and some shortbread and for 4.50 this was decently priced. But the highlight of this flight was well and truly the Avro RJ85 which I wanted to fly on before they all get retired and I am very pleased I did. It is a unique experience and I would recommend for any aviation fans to try this flight as it is relatively cheap and the Avro is an absolute joy.
Krakow to Amsterdam via Paris. This company is improving steadily each day. Their management of delays is top of the line. I got instantly rebooked to an earlier flight in order to get on time for my connecting flight in Amsterdam.
Bangkok to Budapest via Doha. Both flights arrived on time the experience was great. Checked in at business class counter and received lounge pass being silver member. Flight attendant came to me personally and offered a drink before flight. Food was ok 3 selection available. Entertainment with new release movies. The flights were not full so plenty of space available.
The SQ system can almost never get mileage accrual nor ticket changes right. I have called them 29 times in the last 12 months and the contact number has an average waiting time of just over 1 hour. I wasted so much time with them on the line. The service has been downgraded so much. Most amenities are gone. My food was of very low quality and Book the chef is mostly not available even if they claim they are on the website.
Budapest to Singapore via Doha. We flew with our two babies and the crew was extremely helpful and understanding on the whole journey. The upgraded airport in Doha is also very pleasant.
Highly recommended. An excellent choice in both directions ParisJFK and return JFKCDG. We were worried after reading the reviews but had an excellent experience. Arrived early both times luggage arrived very fast and flight crew were great. Great entertainment system and food it was part of the ticket in our return was fine. No need to buy it its a relatively short flight. Flights operate from smaller terminals in both JFK and CDG so no lounges and limited options for food etc. but that also means much faster check in and security on both ends. We were out within less than half an hour from landing. Mild cons It is a low cost airline so luggage is restricted to what you bought but its very straightforward and they were not petty about it.
Went to Israel via Lisbon on TAP Portugal. Check in ok. Lounge at OHare terminal 5 SAS lounge which is inadequate. Boarding on time delayed departure due to rain. Received the gluten free meal I ordered and fell asleep on a flat bed. Had a good night sleep skipped breakfast my son told me it was nothing to write home about. Arrival in Lisbon via a bus gate no need to clear security. No lounge in the Schengen zone. Staff courteous. LISTLV again a bus to the plane not full plane not even close. A321LR 11 and 22 staggered. Very comfortable seats. No gluten free meal but they offered me the guinea fowl which was tasty. I felt ok. There was cheese and desert which I could not eat. The purser really apologized and he genuinely felt bad about it. Cabin not present but if you asked for something it was promptly delivered to your seat. The port served was wonderful. Overall will fly them again if the price is right. Consider a stop over in Portugal. Have a lounge in the Schengen zone. Had to use the Wifi from Lisbon to TLV very expansive but worked well.
Im trying to check in to my flight back to Florida and when I try to do the check in through the website it says my booking information cant be found. First few times I tried to call their customer service the call would drop and I couldnt get anybody on the phone. Now I finally got the automated call and have been waiting for over an hour to talk to a customer service representative. I understand that this is a cheap flight but not able to check in and not able to talk to somebody is not acceptable.
Stansted to Ercan via Antalya. Flight take off and landing on time. Paid for extra legroom going at 15 each and it was a very comfy flight for a budget airline. Food and soft drinks given both ways was an added bonus payable on most other budget airlines. The cabin crew were very good and I agree with the last review saying that it made a nice change not to be hassled into buying something all of the flight On the inward journey we couldnt have extra legroom seats but the plane wasnt full at the back so we used the empty seats. All in all a good experience with Onur air and would use them again.
I flew to Mahe from London Heathrow via Milan. Everything was done on time and service was excellent. Crew were friendly and took great care of my sick mother thought the flight. I really enjoyed the flight and will recommend the airline to anyone who wants to travel to the beautiful Seychelles.
Mumbai to Singapore. Great Flight departedarrived on time. Excellent service. The hard product was the older seat which was significantly worse than the newer ones. This is because the A330s will be retired soon and replaced with Boeing 787 and A350s. I would advise that if possible you catch the A380 flight which leaves around the same time as it would be a better choice in my opinion especially if travelling in business class. Paid roughly 470 SGD for a return ticket which is a great price.
Flight was delayed for over one hour no explanation or apology given until the Captain of the aircraft referred obliquely to the delayed arrival of the incoming flight hard to believe as plane we flewon was at the gate for at least 90 minutes before we were first called upon to board. Once called to board we were left standing in the passenger ramp for 20 minutes again no explanation or apology as the limited flight crew struggled to get people onto the plane it was like the first time any of them had managed a boarding process. Once finally onboard we had to listen to virtually inaudible announcements on a very poor sound system the Captain sounded almost half asleep and then once airborne we were left without any offer of food or drink for almost 2 hours. I have no idea where the flight attendants were or what they were doing all this time but they never appeared in the aisles. Food luke warm and tasteless arrived with cheap wine they ran out of red before everyone could be served. After dinner we were left for almost three hours with no sight of a flight attendant offering any kind of refreshment not even water. I wandered back behind the curtains to find the flight attendants chatting and requested water to take some medication. Movie selection was four movies three of them brated action movies. A grand total of two TV shows available. None of the other entertainment services map etc. were available. The toilet on one side of the airplane ran out of water for flushing. Deplaning took forever again managed by what appeared to be a very inexperienced crew. All in all perhaps the worst flight experience I have had in many many years and I fly domestically and internationally frequently.
Johannesburg to St Denis. Service like it was 30 years ago professional attentive amenity kit handed out on a 3 hour flight and the quality and quantity of the catering Ive not seen for years. Thoroughly recommended.
On our return flight from London we laid over in at Keflavik Airport. We learned when we arrived that we could not return to our departure airport Newark. Instead we were diverted to New York and had to find our own way back to our car before our 3 hour drive home. The Airline has agreed to reimburse our UBER fee since they created a disturbance in our travel plans. However while on the flight to New York seated in row 2 of first class a couple in front of us had a small and very old dog. About an hour before landing the woman was telling the man to hurry and get up because the dog had to pee. She then carried to dog to the service area and told the flight attendant the problem. The attendant gave the woman an extra blanket. The woman returned to the seat put the blanket on the seatput the dog on the seat until it relieved itself Then she returned to blanket to the flight attendant. The blanket was not waterproof or absorbent enough to keep the urine from running down the seat to the floor where of course my personal bag was stored. When I retrieved it my purse was covered with dog urine and half the contents were also wet. I advised the attendant on my way out and she simply said Oh thats not good. Thats it. The smell was awful and I had to carry that bag without any offer to help clean it or bag it...nothing. I will never fly Icelandair again given this wholly unacceptable animal policy. I have no problem with small animals traveling in the cabin as long as there are proper and sanitary provisions for their normal bodily functions. The flights were otherwise clean and comfortable and staff was attentive. WiFI stinks.
Worst airline ever. The website doesnt work properly manage booking or check in or change bag allowance. Planes are never on time. Theyre too cheap to pay for the airbridge so you have to board via bus. When I arrived at my destination all of my clothes inside suitcase are soaking wet. So they mustve left my luggage in a huge puddle for quite a long time in order for that to happen. Baggage takes forever to come out. The food is terrible. And there are no monitors in the back of the seats for entertainment. Its not worth saving the money to fly on this airline.
This is not the first time I have flown Vistara and the experience was amazing. The CheckIn was pretty quick. On board service was excellent and the staff was polite. The flight was on time. In spite of a short flight they still served good snacks. The seat was also better than most airlines I have flown and the plane was clean and hygienic. I will fly with them again.
FV245 LEDFRA 7913. FV246 FRALED 14913. Flew this airline last month to and from FrankfurtMain on vacation. The fare was quite high but I had connection with other family members in FRA so had no choice. The Airbus A320 was okay satisfactory and clean. The seat pitch well Im 1.82m and it is rare that an aircraft is comfortable for me this one wasnt but its a common issue. The flight itself was okay the flight crew were informative. The cabin crew were terrible. Not a single smile. Unkind and impolite. Fellow passengers asked about the reasons for the delay and got a very rude answer. Inflight meal was awful as always. Cant review the ground staff since I had an internet checkin which took me half an hour to deal with. The inbound flight was on time the return was 1.5 hours late. Transit passengers lost their connection flights. The bottom line is that this is the worst not lowcost company I have flown with.
I flew with a friend to Iceland from Toronto for a 4 day trip. We were attracted to wow air because of the cheap price and direct flight to Keflavik international airport near Reykjavik. It is important to note for travellers that you do have to pay for a carry on bag and pay for a checked bag so my friend and I packed our checked luggage together and split the cost however make sure to pay attention to the weight. The website advertises that it needs to be 20kg and as long as we were under 21kg the attendant was fine with our bag. On the flight itself there is a decent amount of space for a backpack under the seat in front and for the price youre paying its great. I was blown away by the customer service on the flight there. I am a very nauseous flyer typically I get motion sickness on any moving vessel. I took a different type of gravol than normal and needless to say ended up vomiting 4 times on the 5.5 hour flight. After the 2nd time I vomited they offered to move me up to premium class but I declined. After the 3rd time they offered again to move me where I had more space to be comfortable and where there would be less intense turbulence. They were so attentive and kept checking up on me to make sure I was okay. They offered me cups of ice continuously and ginger ale and made su.
Dubai to Istambul. Never in my life I faced so rude staff from any place except when I was preparing the check in for my returning flight to Dubai. The lady at the check in was out of information as a resident with a valid ID I can enter to UAE with out showing my resident stamp in my passport but she started calling Duty managers and everyone until they decided that I can not travel so she said I need tourist visa so ridiculous being a UAE resident I need a visa to enter. So I demand to talk with the manager cause all those smart agent were not aware of my privileges as resident. After arguing with that smart lady she got angry cause I put my phone over the desk then that worker transformed she start shouting on me why I was taking a picture. She retaining my passport against my will. After 15 minutes the DM came and she decided I can travel.
Surabaya to Singapore check in was fast. Service started with a hot towel before departure. We took off on time and for the meal I chose chicken. I watched the IFE which had a lot of options. All in all the experience was good.
A totally unremarkable flight on time as comfortable as European configuration goes. No catering due to the storm effect greatly exaggerated. This was advised by email and a euro 15 was provided not easy to use but lounge made up for this loss.
I was on the second flight coming back under the new restrictions set by the Canadian government. When we arrived at our hotel we immediately set out to find our Sunwing rep to organize having the covid test done for our arrival home. He knew nothing about it surprisingly. As Sunwings head office is in Toronto I would hope they would communicate the laws necessary to travel. After two days of asking the Rep to find the information necessary for us to return home we spoke with a few people on our resort who flew with Air Canada they had a bus set up to take them to a clinic to have the test done. We realized Sunwing was not interested in helping us we took matters into our own hands. I contacted the emergency hotline at the embassy in Ottawa they emailed me a list of clinics in the Dominican that provided the test necessary under the new Canadian travel laws. We took a cab to the one closest to us where we had to get a prescription for the test we were told to come back the next day for the test. We went back the next day and needed a stamp And were told to come back again the next day for the test. We realized we were being taken for a ride. After making friends with our cab driver we finally had a translator and after 4 days of running around we got the test. What a waste of our time. After paying for our own way to the airport as we had to go get our test results. We quickly realized that the plane to Montreal that was supposed to leave hours earlier left without its passengers. It was chaos I travel with work Im on a plane every six days and I have never seen anything like this. People shouting laying on the ground sleeping in wheel chairs screaming at Sunwing reps. It was crazy As it turns out all of the information on the covid tests was written down inaccurately and Sunwing wouldnt accept it. The passport numbers were wrong or the date of birth was wrong or not even on it at all. Mine had my age but not birthdate which is on my passport and my passport number was correct making that a stupid and redundant argument. I called the doctor we used for the test he quickly corrected the problem and emailed a new form but then Sunwing wouldnt accept it because it wasnt printed One Sunwing rep recommend that my girlfriend leave me because her information was ok but mine wasnt. Do you believe that In the end they accepted our information but left dozens of people stranded they just packed up and left so unorganized no announcements nothing didnt offer us a meal a ride not even a goodbye nothing they just up and left. The plane was almost empty the flight attendant was not happy but neither were any of us. I asked for a snack after sitting on a tarmac for hours she offered to sell me a sandwich. I declined. I never leave reviews like this and Ive never had a problem with Sunwing. But after watching Air Canada clients get there tests done without any issues then watching them get on a plane without any issues I had to say something. Sunwing was unorganized from the first second I could go on didnt email our confirmation had no answers didnt care about us. Our rep was happy to sell us an excursion which I would have loved to do if I wasnt spending my holiday running around to get a test but could not care less about our safety or way home. I contacted Sunwing to offer them a chance to rectify or at least explain.
We flew with Phuket Air in January but have only just found this site. We must agree with all comments made about this airline. Our outward flight scheduled for 2.00 pm on 18 January was delayed until 7.00 am on 19 January. The aircraft was very cold for the whole journey lots of people sitting with blankets around them. The cabin crew were trying to keep the toilets clean but were not very effective. The in flight service was not of a good standard and we were left for many hours with no food at all. On asking about this we were given a tuna roll. Our return journey which should have left of 29 January at 11.50 pm was delayed until 12.45 pm on the following day. Before we left Sharjah after refuelling the engines on the right hand side of the aircraft were under observation on take off and periodically throughout the rest of the journey. We found this rather worrying more so now after the events of the last few weeks. Our travel insurance company rejected our claim for the return delay because the wording of the airlines letter stated the reason for the delay was aircraft rotation and this is not covered under our policy. We arrived back at Gatwick at 8.30 pm on Sunday and were unable to use our return rail ticket and our son had to make a 400 mile round trip to collect us. We were left considerably out of pocket. We feel that the comments in the press from the airline representative over the fuel spillage incident last week patronising and indifferent to the very real fears of the passengers concerned. Phuket Air pulling out of Great Britain is the best news for travellers to Thailand. The flight problems left us with bad memories of an otherwise very enjoyable holiday.
Worst flying experience ever. We have to wait 17 hours to get back home. We sleep on floors but then security comes and tells us were not even allowed to sit on the floor. They want us to stand for 17 hours On the flight from Vienna to Malta we werent even offered drinks and I dont mean free drinks but not even an option that we could buy them. If you want to travel with Air Malta dont do it. Save your time money and everything. If you still want to go beware that you going to end up in trouble.
Casablanca to Paris. Flight arrived 5 minutes in advance to Paris. The entertainment service is not working for movies and music is very poor only 2 choices. Cleanliness of the plane is ok Plane was not full. This flight is less expensive than the one of Monday.
I booked a flight and went to the airport an hour before the flight. The gate opened 30 minutes before the flight for only 5 minutes. I lost the flight as the queue for the check in at skyexpress was huge Ive already waited 30 minutes at the queue. I asked for a manager to find a solution and there was no one at the airport representing sky express I was forced to book another flight as it was the only solution and lost 75. Ill never again book a flight with sky express and I definitely dont recommend it at all.
Hong Kong to Beijing. The ground handling and boarding process wasnt the smoothest the flight was delayed and Air China tends to operate out of remote terminal boarding gates which require a shuttle ride or extensive walking times. Everything was fine once we were airborne. The staff were attentive and the seats offered a reasonable amount of legroom even though they seemed narrower than usual. The Air China A321 does not have personal IFE they still use the archaic communal IFE systems. Food was average at best. Keep your expectations in line with prices paid and you should be fine.
Am continually disappointed by British Airways. It seems they are now in a race with Ryanair and easyJet to become the worst carrier in and out of the UK. Flew Dusseldorf to London. Their lounge at DUS is closed but their checkin staff doesnt know that she sent me up there. I have a connexion at JFK and I showed her the boarding passes but she wouldnt interline my bag to their partner AA and I had to recheck it. Now not only do they not serve a second meal on the 11hour flight LHRLAX but now they want 2 for a can of coca cola that they pay 15p for. Usually you should always fly across the ocean on a European carrier but with BOAC I recommend Finnair or American with their One World alliance. What is the point
Brisbane to Adelaide. Put my luggage on the scale at home before leaving it was 7.3kg thought they would consider a bit of excess was shocked when the crew put it on the scale it was 8kg. They also include handbags for weighing. Never seen anything like this. Worst experience my wife and I ever had. We have to pay 90 and have to bring along our luggage with us.
LHRSIN in Economy. Very relaxed and prompt check in at T5. A good attentive and humorous cabin crew nice wine dinner enjoyable the same poor breakfast as 20 years ago. Very clean and tidy interior on 777. Punctual and it goes without saying that the flight crew are excellent and you feel safe. Will definitely seek to use again.
Terrible experience. My flight was cancelled and I wasnt even put on the next one. To make things worse I wasnt granted in the lounge either. A very long stay at the airport and no service at all.
RenoVegas. As usual flying Southwest out of Reno is a breeze. Checkin using self service kiosk was effortless as was bag drop. We were the only passengers checking in and it was an hour before the flight. TSA was empty so went right on through in no time at all. Arrived at gate and grabbed a bite to eat and then boarded the plane. Full flight usual beverage and snack while in the air. Free wifi worked fine but since its only an hour flight not really time to get too involved with the movies and shows offered. Arrived in Vegas and luggage was coming off the belt as we arrived at the carousel. Ground staff and cabin crew all did their jobs and made for a pleasant trip. No complaints.
Keflavik Iceland to London Heathrow on an A320 in Business Class. The journey got off on an unpleasant note the Business Class line at Keflavik was so long that it looked like an Economy Class checkin. It took over 30 mins to get through. There was no lounge access offered. The boarding process was well handled. British Airways Business Class seats for the Club Europe product are terrible exactly the same as Economy with the middle seat left vacant. You dont even get extra pitch. What made the overall product tolerable were the good onboard service and the inflight WiFi. Also the fact that the flight leaves at a convenient midmorning time of 1040 am.
Yet another day in SpiceJet glory. My flight gets cancelled precisely 24 hours before They havent heard of advanced communication. Note I have a connecting flight the next day from Bangalore to London. Now in a panic I try every single number for customer care only to be disconnected saying we are busy they havent heard of a call queue. Finally I scanned through the cancellation message a mail and it reads you can get a refund or reschedule. I thought maybe they had automated everything and I would be able to book something on the same day if I follow the link surprise surprise they take me for a complete fool and for that reason every single customer. After you follow their interface it says your money will be refunded in 21 days and there is no option for fight change. I want my money right now in 1 day in fact in 5 minutes the way you looted it while SpiceJet looted it while they gave an illusion for a service. I wonder why the Indian aviation authorities and customer services are not looking in such malpractices.
Luton to Tel Aviv. Full business service in 2x2x2 configuration with full flat bed. The 767 is not young but overall kept clean and in high standard maintenance. Entertainment is very old but the team offer Ipad. Service was very good and the ElAl business team found to be professional nice and welcoming.
Sydney to Toronto via Seoul. Korean Air is one of the best airlines I have travelled with and provided us best possible service. The food cleanness service is impeccable and highly recommend. Looking forward to fly them again on 28 June 2017 but this time from Vancouver to Sydney
I flew from JFK to Israel via Baku and had very positive experience with Azerbaijan Airlines. JFKBaku the plane was a quarter full so I had 4 seats to myself. It was a new and clean airplane. I was served kosher food even though they say on their website its not available on that flight. The airport in Baku is brand new free wifi again almost empty.
My luggage was lost 8 Aug 19 from Chicago to Amman. No Customer Service in trying to locate and return it to me. It took me 7 weeks to get anyone at Royal Jordanian to answer any phone calls or emails. Their Customer Service phone system simply keeps looping you from 1 recorded message to another then hangs up on you. At 2 months to the day my luggage appears on my doorstep at home at 0300 while I am out on the road. At a little over 3 months to the day along with more than 200 emails and phone attempts they offer compensation of less than 20 of my incurred expenses having to deal with their incompetence.
Barcelona to Rome. The agent made us check the weight of every single bag we had even hand bags we consolidated and reconsolidated checked 3 bags and paid the extra costs for the bags and still Alitalia lost our luggage. Worst customer service they could care less that your luggage is lost and do nothing to even try to help. How does no one know where my luggage is and why are the customer service agents so horribly trained.
The boarding went on very smooth. The seat was very comfortable and had enough legroom. I was really disappointed with the meals. I chose the lemon chicken with fried rice. It was a very small portion. No salad was offered. The bread roll was in plastic packet cold and dry. The chocolate cake for dessert was okay. Usually flights between the east coast of Australia and Asia they offer a main meal and a pre arrival meal but on this trip no pre arrival meal was given. I feel like SQ is trying to save money by doing this. The IFE was good. Overall I wont be flying with them in the future.
Gatwick to Bridgetown. Firstly couldnt book myself in online my husband had a reward flight and he was checked in but I couldnt move him his seat was fixed. So we had to leave mega early so I could sit near him Luckily got the seat behind him. Food and seats terrible. Tea time snack an insult 2 small cookies. Breakfast was a muesli bar I already have booked with BA again for Tampa but they are the only airline that fly there direct however my annual flights to Barbados will be with Virgin in future. I have complained twice re check in meals and the broken tray table on the return trip and have been offered 5000 Avios points 40 that just ties me into flying with them again especially as they expire every year so will disappear before I might want to use them The cutbacks are a cut too far BA. Tip buy a sandwich in Boots on way out and buy something to eat on way back before you go to the airport.
I have flown with bmi Regional a number of times for business in Aberdeen from Bristol. 75 of the time the flight is delayed. This means it is impossible to plan business meetings as they are so unreliable and completely defeats the purpose of a regional airline. After sticking with them for so long I have finally given up and will not use them again instead opting for an alternative route. Would not recommend unless timing is not important to you.
LondonSt PetersburgNovosibirsk. All flights on time cabin crew friendly and food pretty good and substantial. All planes were oldish A319Airbus but comfortable and clean. I had to collect luggage and re checkin after each flight which was annoying and there was no inflight entertainment but these were really only minor downsides to a trouble free journey.
A great experience flying Business Class from Istanbul to Denpasar Bali via Singapore. We loved the lie flat beds although a very warm cabin prevented getting a lot of sleep. FB service excellent and professionally served by the SQ crew. Love the Book the Cook service where you can order fine dining meals in advance. Great choice of wines and plenty of champagne refills My wife can only eat gluten free meals and a small criticism is the lack of gluten free options WiFi allowance of only 100 Mb in Business Class is rather limited as well. Very smooth transfer in Singapore and Kris Lounge not too crowded. The Turkish Airlines lounge used by SQ at Istanbul Airport is massive and offers an excellent choice of hot Turkish food. All in all a great flight with SQ and look forward to flying Business Class again with them soon.
Bangkok to Chennai. No specific order of boarding beyond the premium seat passengers. Buses used to transport passengers from gate to plane overly packed and crowded. The time from boarding till take off in air was around 40 minutes when the air inside the plane was hot and steamy. Cabin crew unresponsive and refused to give complimentary water to my small daughter. Not sure about the age of the plane.
Monrovia to Kigali through Accra and Nairobi 1920 May 2022. The 2 aircrafts were both B737800s in very good condition. I had to change my departure dates and it took me only 10 minutes online and was even free as it was a Business Light ticket. All flights were on time. Checked in online. Monrovia Airport is full of hustlers pretending to be from the airline but want tips and they are annoying the airline should chase them away. Kenya Airways KQ uses a third party lounge in Monrovia which is small but good with courteous proactive attendants. No champagne but plenty of drinks and liquor. The local Club beer is good. Embarking easy fast not a single crosscheck from lounge to seat what a pleasure. Onboard welcome drinks were served. The seats were huge and well bolstered reclining new and very comfortable. Could sleep. IFE or WiFi was only working on the last leg. No printed menus were given out but the FAs asked each individual on food choices. My preordered special sea food meals were all different delicious and served without reminders. Business Class was full after Accra but I did neither feel cramped nor stuffy. FAs all Kenyans were good and caring though maybe not world class. In NBO the Pride lounge did the job for me during the 12 hours layover. The last stretch to Kigali was with IFE onboard champagne and my beloved seafood hot meal which KQ still offers even in economy in contrast to Qatar and Emirates who have stopped this service at is it not qualifying as dietary reasons to order. Luggage delivered quickly and in good order. Good value for money will fly with them again.
Dammam to Manila return via Doha. I have been flying with Qatar Airways particulary on the Boeing 777300ER from Doha to Manila for a couple of years now in business class with much satisfaction. Each year some additional nuances are added to make the flight more pleasurable. This last flight was on seat 2A DammamDoha A330200 and 2K DohaManilaDoha B777300ER and 2A DohaDammam A320. Cabin crew make extra efforts to provide passengers needs anytime. Food options are very good. One note however I still prefer the Armani amenity kit of the past rather than the latest one. I suppose Qatar Airways would like to consider utilizing a newer aircraft on certain days like the A350 or Boeing 7878 on their Manila route or Southeast Asian route generally.
Most uncomfortable seats which barely lean back. Bare minimum everything no wifi no inflight entertainment. Everything costs something soda snacks etc. They cancelled flights less than a month out because they changed their routes and neglected to alert anyone to this effect. Excuse of an airline.
Miami to Gatwick. We just came back from Miami to UK with this airline outsourced by Norwegian. My seat was broken and would not tilt back so all 8 hours flight I had to seat stick straight. I did report it to a staff member but they have done nothing. There is no entertainment at all so make sure you take book or magazines. To make it worst we waited over 2 hours in to a flight for stewardess to buy any drinks. We asked 5 times and they kept saying that someone is coming. Staff members were sharing funny looks with knowing smiles when asked for something by customer. Although they were all nice and polite you could see it was not genuine. There is no wifi or USB plug to charge your phone. Would definitely advise to avoid flying with them if possible.
I took a business class trip from Beijing to London and the service was not as good as previous trips. The crew greeted me in a pleasant manner and presented me with welcome drinks etc. However when one female crew member took my dinner order she forgot to ask for drink choices and it also applied to the person next to me. None of us had any drinks with our meal and it was in biz class. My prebooked special meal did not turn up until I asked either. Their procedure was to check with special meal requests then serve but this was not done correctly. My friend asked me to complain onboard I didnt think that particular member of staff was worth of complaining. Its the natural ability to serve and to do a good job that she is lacking. Other than that the flight in biz class was comfortable enough the drinks were plenty.
Genoa to Paris. This was an Air France flight operated by local carrier CityJet. Everything was done through the Air France website and I was able to upgrade to business class for around 200. The business class seat was probably one of the smallest seat I ever flown however the service was fantastic and for a flight that lasted under two hours there is really nothing to complain about. The airplane had four engines thing that I found quite interesting since it was very small aircraft. I was served a full breakfast that was very nice and the presentation was five star. I would fly this airline again without hesitation.
London City to Mahon and Madrid back into City. No delay at check in and a breeze through security. 15 mins delayed departing LCY with no explanation from ground staff who just seemed slow. An ok hot breakfast and tea coffee was welcome though I was surprised that there was no bar service after the meal was served. Return from Madrid was delayed an hour due to the flight deck walk around finding a scrape which needed checking out. A drink from the bar was fine but a 18 gram bag of savoury snacks is an insult. City flyer remains superior to flying BA from Heathrow mainly due to the E190 being a spacious and new plane. However with a bit of effort BA could achieve a better level of service especially around catering.
We are flying Business class for most of our flight and then Premium economy for the balance. In addition to the plane tickets we paid an additional 225pp for our seats. Now BA is changing planes they arbitrarily put us in separate seating areas my wife I when we were sitting together before and they want to charge one of us additional to be reseated next to each other. They moved our seats away from each other and we shouldnt have to pay for their change of planes and their decision to not have us sitting together We havent even flown yet this airline is horrible.
I used British Airways to Hong Kong in 2012 and remember vowing to never use them again. However as I needed to get to New York and back quickly I had to use British Airways and I thought they may have bucked up their ideas. The flight to NYC was on a Boeing 747 which really did need an uplift the seats and decor was tired and the staff rude. The entertainment system was terrible and limited. On the return flight I was on a Boeing 777 and although slightly more modern the entertainment again was limited and the control unit didnt work. The staff were better than the previous flight. However British Airways did manage to mislay my baggage between NYC and Manchester and I received it 24hours later battered and missing some clips and thankfully nothing broken inside. Ive decided that whenever I fly eastw Ill continue using Emirates or Singapore Airlines both of a far higher quality than British Airways and to the USA maybe Virgin have to be better than BA surely. Ill never use BA again.
We flew Air France from Miami to Warsaw connecting in Paris. Air France has only one round trip a day from Miami to Paris. I had been tracking the flights for three weeks before our departure date on flightradar. Most of the time the incoming flight was late. On July 11 2018 I received a text message from Air France at approximately 1030 AM stating that our fight would be delayed one hour from 740 PM to 840 PM. The plane departed at 10 PM two and twenty minutes late. We arrived in Paris forty minutes before our connecting fight to Warsaw. The plane sat on the runway for approximately twenty minutes because our gate was not available. I cannot understand why this flight could not have been assigned another gate. Most of the people around me missed their connecting flights like me. We ran as fast as we could to the connecting flights gate. We arrived ten minutes before flight departure time but the gate closes twenty minutes before departure. We went to customer service with long lines and few people working behind the counter. The first connecting flight to Warsaw was filled. They put us on the second connection approximately six hours later. Thirty minutes after getting my connecting flight changed I received a text message that I missed my original connecting flight brilliant. In my opinion Air France could care less about their MiamiParis one round trip a day. Their customer service needs a lot of improvement. This was my first and last time to fly Air France.
Terrible terrible experience. Flying out from Boston on June 5th at 945 and was landing at Ilha Terceira which it wasnt where we supposed to be landed. We supposed to land in Ponta Delaga and our connection flight was at 730am. However we didnt land till 830 in Ilha Terceira. Then the representatives there told us we couldnt fly out from this island due to the weather inclement. We had lost a day of traveling. The airline representative told us we can get a flight to Lisbon around 12pm or 1pm. By the time we got to Lisbon there wasnt any flight to go to CDG Paris so we had to wait till the next morning for a next flight at 550am in the morning. The representative at Lisbon had told us there are no more hotels around the area to accommodate us and the deal that they gave us is that if we can find any hotel they willing to reimburse us back for up to 80. And now im talking to the airline to get the declaration of delaycancellation to proof to the claim department that we got delaycancellation and everything was messed up they told me I had to paid 20eu in order to get the declaration because im over 15 day of the rules to get the declaration letter. I do not recommend this airline company to fly to europe. Everything was bad experience since we left from Boston.
Check in was very easy. There was a slight delay in departure but was no big deal. The staff were very friendly and good humoured as well as very well organised. The food was quite good and the wines served were excellent. Overall a great way to finish a break.
I honestly wish I could say better things about this airline I was very disappointed. I flew Japan airlines from India to the United States with a layover in Narita. The staff was very friendly and patient. Not sure where everything broke down but both my seat and vegetarian meal requests were ignored. The issues began with online checkin checked into my flight online and was told to pick up my boarding pass at the airport. 8 weeks prior I requested a vegetarian meal and window seat for both legs of my flight when I was booking. During checkin I made sure to request a vegetarian meal again which did not make it onto my boarding pass. I noticed during check in that I was assigned an aisle and middle seat for the two legs Id booked a window seat. Tried to request a seat change at the gate at both airports but was very nicely at Narita I want to stress told the flight is full and theres nothing we can do. And at both airports when I requested the vegetarian meal again theres nothing we can do theyve already loaded the food onto the flight. Not sure what happened but Im extremely disappointed with Japan Airlines.
From booking to landing everything was smooth easy and convenient. The crew whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight.
Hong Kong to Malaga via Istanbul. Be aware of this airline these days they just cancel flights for no reason and last minute. They cancelled 2 times of my flight ticket HK Istanbul Malaga. You dont want this for you especially during a pandemic situation while everything is changing all you want is a reliable airline that take you to your destination as planned. I changed everything hotels rentals and even with my dog The experience for booking ticket for my dog traveling along wasnt nice either. The way to book is to call their call center where they only know how to keep seat but no idea in regards to the process sending and picking up dog at both airports you have to call local sales team for it. But for my case the HK local team has no responding for 2 weeks and still hasnt replied a proper answer.
I had a very bad experience today with the crow of flight number SV 590 from Jeddah to Dubai We were six passengers with an infant less than one year and we was traveling with a small stroller as its a night flight and the babe is sleeping most of the time and we used the same stroller with us from Dubai to Cairo and same on the way back The crew team have shown unacceptable behavior by showing their finger to keep the stroller aside and not to take it inside the airplane same as we did on our previous flights. When I asked the reason he said thats my shift and I dont take stroller inside. I asked to speak to the supervisor just to explain to him that we used the same from Cairo then he seems to be not the supervisor and refer me to the crew who have showed same attitude with no explanation as if I begging from him.
Melbourne to Delhi via Singapore. Flying Premium Economy was disappointing over rated seating and food was average and similar to Economy apart from slight extra leg room it was not premium at all. Service was below average. Transit in Singapore was also disappointing as agreed requests to ground staff were not actioned on aircraft. After a long time am using my KrisFlyer points for my wife to travel Business Class from Melbourne to Rome via Singapore on in August 2018 whilst I am travelling on a Business Class ticket. My wifes SINROME booking using KrisFlyer points remains waitlisted on Business Saver Class despite 3 months of booking. Instead Singapore Airlines wishes me to pay approx AUD1500 to upgrade my wifes Business Saver Class to the next subclass. This is unacceptable and disappointing. Despite being a loyal customer for over 30 years a fair significant of which is as a PPS member until recently the airline is unable to assist. Based on poor treatment todate in respect of item 3 above it appears that Singapore Airlines is misleading with its KrisFlyer program in that passengers are encouraged to join up but the ability to redeem points is difficulta very long wait.
We were unable to check in online. We phoned regarding this and after being hung up on twice by rude staff we were told it would be sorted at the airport which it was. However on the way back we were told the flight had been overbooked we were on standby but this would be resolved at the gate. It was not. We tried to talk to various members of staff but they either did not speak enough English or shouted at us. We were given a voucher for a meal which got us one slice of pizza and were left to navigate Istanbul Airport by ourselves. We eventually found the place to collect our luggage but were told it was too much work for them to locate it. After insisting we eventually got our suitcases back and transit to the worst hotel. We got a flight home one day late. We were told we would get 400 euros compensation but that did not happen today because there are no Turkish Airlines staff at Edinburgh Airport so we are still chasing this.
Flew Warsaw to Heathrow. Reasonable all round. Fairly nice sandwich and drinks. Crew were patient with some passengers who thought they were in an all inclusive hotel. Very busy flight. New seats are extremely cramped. Feels a bit Ryanair. Boarding a bit chaotic as didnt do by seat row. Baggage started coming off one carousel at Heathrow only to inexplicably move to a different one without warning or announcement.
Kota Bahru to Subang. This was my second time on Firefly the first was the journey from SZB to KBR earlier in the day. The flight was delayed supposed to depart at 8.45 pm but only by 9.30 pm that the plane left the airport. Notwithstanding the flight was okay all the way to SZB. The cabin crews were attentive and landing was smooth.
San Francisco to Singapore via Taipei. Flying back from a holiday with my wife and a 3yo daughter. Booked flights via an agency with a confirmed seat all 3 of us seating next to each other. Expecting that the seats were all set we were not able to see that the seats they had assigned are not seating next to each other. Upon sitting in the plane a lady passenger said the seat is assigned to her good thing she was okay swapping seat. Its just so disappointing that Eva Air knows that a single booking has been made and expecting to have all 3 of us seating next to each other honest mistake didnt bother to check the tickets for the seat numbers expecting that they were all set since the booking made has assigned seats already but then when you try asking for help from the San Francisco staff to check if we can have all seats together they say the flight is full and the tone is just not close to any customer service conversation. The flight was good food was warm and delicious. I just found the cabin staff to be hurried and quite brusque.
After extensive delays with no communication from ground staff we boarded our Bangkok to Singapore flight. There were about 60 of us total on an Airbus 350 that held five times that many people so everyone had plenty of room to spread out. The 350 is a great aircraft and it took me less than 5 minutes on board to figure out that I wanted my next trans pacific flight on one of thesetheyre quiet spacious and high tech. From the reclining seats that slide forward to make life easier on those behind you to the headrests which seemingly defy the laws of physics they fold inand out the attention to detail is superb. The tray tables have a tablet stand and the personal space in general had more functions than I could figure out. Cathay service onboard really doesnt need another glowing reviewit was superb as expected. Meals were excellent and served promptly trays were also collected promptly as well after the meal. The inflight entertainment is really top notch though the screen is a bit jumpy as you scroll through. For those of us with terrible hearing the volume is adequate without being turned up too highit helps that the plane is very quiet at cruise altitude. Make the effort to fly this plane and Cathay if its going where you are.
Booked the flight 2 months in advance then out of the blue canceled and changed to a different day. Trying to change it was impossible let alone cancel it. When we get after we got delayed for 2 hours and then once we got there our luggage was missing. We reported to get it back but it is apparently still in Canada even though we are in Mexico not to mention with this we lost our connection flight because of this didnt even offer a hotel or food just 100 dolloars for the lost luggage that used need to wait 48 to even use been. Has been an absolute nightmare and dont recommend. You are wasting more money then you are saving with them and you ONLY buy the seat nothing else.
On 03222020 EVA Air cancelled my flight from Bangkok to Seattle via Taipei for 30th march. On 03272020 I submitted the refund request form on their website and they have not issued me a refund yet. I have tried calling every phone number I can find for them however they just ring and ring and ring. Some of the numbers have automated messages saying they have a high volume of calls right now and then hang up on you.
A complete nightmare. Flexibleopen tickets as offered on the website cant be changed as promised. Any email address of Turkish will bounce back immediately tried dozens. Even as an Elite member I am told up to the supervisor that the English text is misunderstandable. No confirmation names or case numbers are given. We have 3 tickets in our company cant cancel because of website problems Try again in 2 hours and call again. I love their onboard product and understand those are difficult times. But blocking all contact options and the chance to change a ticket is not the way to go.
MXPNOSMXP YClass. Air Madagascar features quite old aircraft B767 but clean. FAs attentive to passengers needs polite and ready to offer you a smile. Tasty food but poor entertainment program no PTVs. Very punctual flights on both legs. Nice amenities were given on board.
This morning the 06h00 flight from Cape Town to Bloemfontein was cancelled due to aircraft issues. The airline knew this was a possibility yesterday already and did not take steps to ensure that passengers were notified and rebooked on Mango at 09h30. When arriving at the check in counter 109 passengers are sent to SA Airways reservations. You are then informed that SAA no longer does the rebooking for SA Express. Thereafter you are sent to flight control at counter 30. From there you are sent to Mango at counter 101. After walking from one end of the terminal building to the other you are then asked to come back at 07h00 as the SA Express office in Bloemfontein needs to change the booking to Mango but they only open at 06h00. Surely this should have been anticipated and planned for yesterday evening for the latest Emailing customers services is of no use as the only response is the automatic email reply with a case number. Dont bother emailing the customer services manager as he just doesnt bother replying. My advice to anyone who wishes to use this airline .... book on an alternate airline as SA Express really is unreliable and their customer service is no existent.
Moscow to Singapore via Dubai. Spacious and comfortable A380 planes excellent seats and lots of fresh air in the cabin. A380 surely provides a more relaxing and smooth flying experience. Convenient and easy transfer at Dubai. All flights were on time. Very attentive and courteous service good food and drinks. Great entertainment system with lots of new and interesting movies. Unprecedented value for money.
Dublin to Dubai via Istanbul. Travelled economy no hassle with either flight. It was great to be able to travel again. The only issue was with a tight connection coming and going we left Dublin 30 minutes late so had to run a half marathon to get to the gate for our flight to Dubai. On the return leg we had more time but had to go through security screening again so had to leg it again. It would have been nice to have had a chance to have a coffee. Istanbul Airport is big in fact so big that getting around it a challenge for the able must be a struggle for anyone who isnt in good physical shape.
I would never fly Frontier again. My flight was delayed. My connecting flight was canceled. They lost my bag its not worth even if it was free. I had to pay 500 to American Airlines get me home. I drove back in Hartford looking for my bags no one has a clue stay away from frontier.
Warning If you are shopping around for flights and Breeze shows up on the list keep looking My dads flight was supposed to leave at 3.40 and it was delayed around 10 times. It was tough to keep up because each time they sent an email they would send another email. The flight finally left at 11.54 last night. They do not have customer service meaning you cant just call a number to get support. This airline is an absolute nightmare. We ended up buying another flight to ensure that he was able to get home. We lost all trust that this company would actually take off from the ground after so many delays. We will never fly with them again. Dont let the lower airfare sway you. Theres a reason its cheaper. They wont leave on time and they wont help you if you need support.
Phuket to Dubai. Aircraft boarding was haphazard but everyone was boarded 10 minutes before departure time. There was then a delay of over 1 hour as a mother informed cabin crew that her son was unwell. Eventually they were all offloaded and the flight departed 75 minutes late. During the delay we were asked what we wanted for a meal both first and second choices were unavailable. Eventually I ended up having the lunch instead of breakfast which meant that there was not much choice for lunch. Cabin crew service was hit and miss. Seat comfort was acceptable and far better than those on the A380. No amenity packs were offered. Arriving at Dubai late we had 20 minutes to catch the connecting flight which entailed using the rail link and with faulty lifts in the terminal we just made the connection. Discounting the delay I was not overly impressed with Emirates and thought that the flight was poor value for money.
Singapore from Bangkok and I had a disappointing flight. Inflight entertainment was great good legroom but less comfy seat. However service was below expectation especially when the crew did not give a friendly smile and also food and beverage service was rather slow. No bread and butter and distilled water served with inflight meal. Clearing of trays took ages and had to squeeze to move to the washroom. Embarrasing moment celebrating Anniversary trip.
Edinburgh to London City and first time flying BA City Flyer and enjoyed the service. Check in quick and polite security busy but quick too I had an hour in the Galleries lounge which was okay for a coffee. Boarding via A8 and steps on to a nice looking clean E170 Seat 1A very nice crew pretty chatty and funny actually. Departed on time one airborne a coffee and snack offered which apparantly BA proper can no longer afford on the EDILHR service. Its my first time on BA CityFlyer my first time on this type of aircraft and my first use of London City. Landed a few minutes early bags off quickly a great service. I find BAs franchises or subsidiary operated services such as Comair in South Africa or BA Cityflyer normally operate a superior service to BA.
Had a Priority ticket from Ibiza to Lisbon via Barcelona. The process at the airport with check in luggage drop off is good and efficient. Boarding is also acceptably organized. The airplane was very dirty obviously it is not cleaned often. The seats are uncomfortable and the pitch is very short so for a 18m tall person it is not a very good experience. Flights on time.
The most over rated airline Customer service is the worst that Ive experienced. Ground crews were downright rude. We asked one of the ground crew for priority boarding since we were travelling with our 6 month old baby but he only told us to go to the end of the queue in a very rude way. During the boarding they did not call priority boarding for elderly disabled passengers and passengers travelling with babies. Cabin crews were equally as rude and dismissive. For goodness sake we are your customers and your job is to give us good service. We are never flying Emirates anymore especially going anywhere to Asia.
My flight from Manchester to Norwich on 21st December was unavoidably delayed due to heavy fog in Norwich. The pilot came out to the passengers to explain this and paid particular attention to two elderly customers who were in wheelchairs even offering his only coat to one. He stayed with us the entire time and updated us constantly. The cabin crew brought us mince pies and were very comforting. I cannot praise them enough for the service provided and wont hesitate to recommend use them again. The flight itself was smooth and the pilot landed safely in tremendously awful thick cloud. Thank you.
Flew Hong Kong Airlines from Hong Kong to Bangkok. The exterior of the plane was very dirty. The interior was very red and upon embarkation and disembarkation there was cheesy Asian music playing out of the tannoy system. The interior was rather old and there was no inflight entertainment on board this actual aircraft. The food was pretty poor with just a sausage roll being offered. Every time the captain put on the seat belt sign the cabin crew would march down the aisle making sure that everyone was wearing their seatbelts. They refused to serve any joy drinks during this time. Compared to Cathy Pacific this was a pretty poor effort.
Sydney to Noumea. We had a very poor experience at check in the lady was rude and did not even care to greet us or wish us a safe flight. Im not sure what her excuse was for it but she was condescending and it really put us off right at the start of our vacation. Our toddler was trying to grab her attention to greet her and she did not even acknowledge her.
Montreal to London Heathrow. Flight and service was cheap except for the price. I expected better and this was not value for money. Advance seat selection is expensive just plain gouging on top of ticket price. It is complimentary on Air Canada. Even with boarding pass prearranged there is no Bag drop in Montreal just one long line British Airways BA staff. Air Canada next time.
Yangon to Mandalay. Lounge photo and In flight meal photo are added. We can access Lounge at Yangon International Airport for all Business Class traveler variety of Breakfast. Lounge is located at the 3rd floor of Yangon International Airport Terminal 3 for domestic. In flight meal is great but simple because it is just a 1 hour short flight.
Glasgow to Hong Kong return via Dubai on Boeing 777300 and A380. Very average experience all round all flights on time and did what they said theyd do. Marked deterioration in service standards since I last flew them two years ago no hot towels drinks came after meals finished second meal basically one mouthful and IFE nowhere near as extensive as advertised on their website. Cabin crew wholly unmemorable. All in all unremarkable and uninspiring but got from A to B. Would fly again if price good and times worked but wouldnt go out of my way to do so.
San Francisco to London. After paying 4000 for flights which I had to cancel they wouldnt allow any change of dates or change of name and after all that wouldnt give me the Avios points because I wont be on the flight.
Absolutely terrible arrive to check in 13 passengers all with hand luggage under 10kg and got told we all need to pay 50 euro for each bag. We tried to refuse but were told pay or not fly. 1 lad slid his bag away unnoticed rest of us paid 600 euro in all. Felt ripped off the lad who slid his bag away got on plane no questions asked.
I was booked in First Class as a paying passenger on this airline but went to check in and was told they had oversold the flight. I was bumped onto a Qantas flight leaving half an hour later via Dubai which may have been a blessing in disguise as Qantas was outstanding see my seperate review. I chose the flight with BA via Singapore for timing reasons for sleep and for the use of the First Class arrivals lounge at Heathrow as I had a flight onto Berlin several hours later. By going via Dubai it threw my sleep out and no arrivals lounge to use. I had to change terminals and beg my way into a standard BA lounge which was no mean feat. What really annoyed me about this was BAs attitude to the whole thing. Firstly I am of the opinion that no plane should be oversold least of all First Class. I was after some compensation for the inconvenience they caused and eventually they offered me a 200 voucher after weeks of back and forth emails. I had a Business Class return ticket to Sydney and was after an upgrade as compensation not unreasonable otherwise I wouldnt have asked for it. The whole experience of dealing with BA in regard to this was awful. For a fare paying First Class passenger to be bumped off a flight and be treated so disrespectfully after the event is a poor reflection on their level of professionalism. I will not be travelling with this airline again.
I was a solo traveler 2 luggage I was charged 74.00 for the one I carried. We fly with no internet connection the whole trip. Second stop Guatemala we get off off the plane with no clue where to go for custom search. Finally after luggage inspection they into 3 different lines I was chosen to be search in a close room and questioned. I am a67 years old male with a 43 years USA residency never have any single issues with authorities finally they let me go same thing happened with several other passengers.
Booked round trip TorontoCosta Rica and forgot to add Carry on luggage. Upon boarding the plane in Toronto I was pull aside to pay for carry on and the cost was 120 USD one way Without much to do I paid. On the way back I called in advance to add carry on at a cost of 55 USD and the customer service person confirmed payment was completed. Days later I arrived to the airport and once again was pull aside during boarding apparently my transaction didnt go thru despite the fact customer service confirmed it was and was asked to pay 95 USD. I submitted a complain and got confirmation that my transaction was booked but apparently was cancelled after the fact although they acknowledge that it was an issue on their end they still would not reimburse the cost difference. Regardless of the cost difference the fees are insane. Can airlines just include all in the base fare and dont surprise customers with those crazy fees Airlines just get away with a lot of customer abuse.
We booked a RT for two in business class departing on July 23 2022. The night before our departure we were down graded to economy. Icelandair told us we would receive a refund. Almost 3 months have passed and despite several emails to the contrary we have yet to receive a refund for the service downgrade. Our return flight on September 3 involved a marathon hike through a congested airport several long lines and a bus ride across the airport. We were seated in business for this leg of the trip but he food was indifferent and the staff inattentive. It was an overall poor experience.
VientianeLuang Prabang return. Short flight only 40 minutes. First flight was flown with new ATR72500. Nice leather seats. Very cold air conditioning. Serve only a glass of water last time was cookie and water clean cabin with friendly crew. The return flight was by MA60 delayed about 20 minutes. The same served with a glass of water and serviced by friendly crews.
Very good entertainment screens. Tasty food even though it was a short flight. Good space seats did have escape row. Had a very good flight was very impressed.
Doha to Kuwait. I tried to travel during the heavy rains in Kuwait had to wait 6 hours to check in and after that 6 hours at the gate. Kuwait Airways representative was hiding no info no service at all. I decided to cancel my ticket went back to the check in counter and after I tried to do the same through their whatsapp as well but no answer at all. Sent email for refund same story. They are not answering the phone either. I regret choosing this cheap airline but will never make the same mistake again.
Paris to Tashkent. Check in counters are located in CDG 2A terminal very quiet in the afternoon. Business tickets allow us to make a stop in the glamorous Cathay Pacific lounge Champagne. And again Champagne as a welcome drink Uzbek cuvee on the return warm nuts as an aperitif. Full dinner service three choice. Light breakfast served before landing. Seats are 212 comfortable amenities in a nice travel kit IPad provided. Crew very attentive during all the flight same for the return from Tashkent.
I was one of the passengers who stuck abroad due to the Covid19 pandemic and I had to change my return flight date for 7 times until I got back to the UK.The staff at Sulaymaniyah office of Qatar Airways were very helpful and change my flight ticket for 7 times without any hesitation and the staff who helped me a lot. I will always fly with Qatar Airways and I have recommended Qatar Airways to many friends.
Shanghai to Macau with Air Macau. My flight NX135 was supposed to depart at 1640. I got to the airport at 1500 and I was told that the flight was delayed because the airplane was still in Macau. So at least 3 hours delay but they had no idea when the plane was flying to Shanghai and also no idea why it was still in Macau. At the gate the staff told us it was due to air traffic and weather in Guangzhou. In the end we boarder at 2330. I spent 8.5 hours at the airport. When I came back I was told by my friends and colleagues that this is very common with Air Macau thus I am sure Im not flying with this airline anymore.
This was my third experience with this airline this year and will be the last. I have never departed on time and they seem to have very poor organisation. The way they treat passengers is not friendly and they are not helpful at all. Boarding chaotic and priority order not respected. On our last trip we were travelling in club class and our luggage had special tags and were supposed to be delivered first at arrival they lost our suitcase. Their website instruct passengers to contact their agent at the airport but there was no air Transat agent or desk at Basel airport. The airline was totally unhelpful and to date we have not heard anything from them or any other party regarding our lost luggage. No idea if our luggage was lost at Montreal airport Basel airport or stolen. No apologies no compensation. What is the point of paying an extra fee for a better service if there is no service in the end.
I travelled with FlyNas approximately 10 times early last year and insisted to my employer that I would never Fly with them again. 45 times they were late usually between 14 hours. They provide almost no information to passengers about the delays and just let them sit there waiting for something to happen. Shockingly inept organisation and shockingly inept communication. Having changed employer this year Ive had to try them again. Unsurprisingly their app still doesnt work properly on iPhoneX at least forcing you to use a Web browser and take a screen shot of the ticket. I checked in online last night and came to Dubai terminal 1 thinking Id get through emigration and use one of the sleep pods for a late morning flight. Only I was told that they didnt accept FlyNas eboarding cards I had to use a normal printed one but FlyNas counters were closed so I had to get a taxi to a local hotel instead. This morning someone told me thats because of the visa checks that need to be done in person which Emirates Saudia and Fly Dubai seem capable of doing online. It appears that FlyNas arent linked up to the systems to enable this online yet they dont feel like this is worth mentioning when you do checkin online. Ive travelled lots and I have no qualms in saying that FlyNas are utterly useless. A bit cheaper than most of the other airlines but a truely awful experience.
Jakarta SoekarnoHatta CGK to Yogyakarta YIA. I was attracted by their advertisement marketing themselves as a millennial airline offering a millennial experience and sure enough this new lowcost carrier spinoff of Lion Air has already impressed me right from the start. The ground staff handling transit passengers were very proactive and quick to assist me and my family so that we can transfer from terminal 2E to 1A without having to exit the terminal building. Boarding was conducted 20 minutes behind schedule and when I stepped into the plane the fear of this flight getting delayed was swept away by the very energetic proactive and friendly cabin crews. Never had I encountered a cabin crew so proactive in assisting me in opening the AC vents until this super crew came. That attitude was maintained throughout the flight. We took off 1 hour behind schedule which is not their fault and soon after I got the privilege to try their WiFibased inflight entertainment. There were sadly no music selections but they covered that up with neverseenbefore contents such as podcasts vlogs emagazines etc. The seat still retained from Indigo was comfortable with slightly more extra legroom due to the slim design. The landing was obviously behind schedule but overall I do think that this new airline surpassed my expectations and they managed to step up their game as a lowcost carrier. My only critique is that the flight attendants of this flight used an excessive amount of PA announcements it could have been made more efficient. Super Air Jet gets high praise from me.
HKG to Danang. Great crew both ways. Boarding and disembarking not great though on return to HK lots of messing about getting buses etc but got dropped off right at immigration. Seats fine no entertainment at all as old style plane. Very hard working crew food fine actually better than CX. Coffee tea on request and fast always with a smile. Dragonair crew do work very hard and even with some tricky customers over demanding macro polo holders mainlanders they do really well a larger plane would do well at this growing destination
There are so many things to say about this round trip flight that I cannot go into it all so I will just highlight. Flight info was changed about 5 times in the month before the actual trip which meant having to change my shuttle info from Augusta GA to Atlanta airport. Atlanta flight was delayed so many hours that I almost missed my flight to San Jose Costa Rica. Im 64 yrs old running a full on sprint from Gate 4 to Gate 14 as I hear my name being called over the loud speaker. And my gate info had been changed to Gate 13 which was incorrect. Flight home was delayed so late that I missed the shuttle from Atlanta to Augusta and lucky for me the lady sitting next to me with her son was supposed to be on the same shuttle to Augusta. She had already called her daughter to drive to Atlanta and pick her up. Atl airport is 2 123 hours from Augusta she said I could tag along. I was so grateful I would have had to spend the night in the Atlanta airport it is after midnight at this time. Last shuttle pick up is 1200 midnight. My daughter drove from Augusta to meet me about an hour away where they dropped me off. So the shuttle service doesnt give a refund only a credit to be used within the year. Well I rarely travel this was the first flight I had taken in 20 yrs. so I am just out that 70.00. I will never fly Spirit again
This airline is a nightmare. My brother booked a flight paid for it got an email the morning of to check in and then got to the airport and there was no flight and no one to help him. We were unable to do anything other than Whatsapp the airline help desk no phone number no email which was a bot. Never using play again. I recommend staying far far away from them.
Flight was cancelled due to weather rebooked to more than 24h later. Only option is a credit that has to be used within less than a year or you lose your money and they dont communicate with you at all about their decision you need to magically look under your user ID with them. Porter used to feel fresh now it feels like a grind. Will travel by train next time.
I was attracted to the promotion of Hong Kong Airlines recently flying from Shanghai to Bangkok via Hongkong. Hongkong Airlines fleet includes A320 and A330200300 Business class seats of Shanghai to Hongkong leg are separate and laid flat to 180 degree arranged 121. Business class in A333 is same but what different is an extra bar in it that was not used during our short flight and seats are arranged by 222 type. Whats more the seats cannot be laid flat totally. Cabin service is nice as a whole. About food and beverage I can say that is very good 2 or 3 kinds of entree choice on menus. Red wine and white wine can be provided to me but no champagne. By the way view of Lounge in Hong Kong airport is wonderful and the location is so good to watch planes on airport.
This was the nicest transatlantic flight Ive taken and Ive been traveling to and from Paris a lot. It was a very large and comfortable plane. The flight attendant who took care of us was delightful. The seats were very comfortable and went almost completely flat for an actual sleep. The food was even decent. We flew back on Air Canada which was fine but I was sad it was not the same as the way out. I will try to fly with Corsair on my next trip in October. Thank you
Cardiff to Monastir return. Never again with this airline. Dirty cabin seat pocket full of rubbish ripped seats I had a person in my lap all the way home as the seat wouldnt go vertical and my rear end on a broken spring all the way there. On the way back we could actually see the flight deck as we took off as the door wasnt shut again very off putting. Food was ok but tea and coffee sparse and cold. A lot of the duty free goods were unavailable.
Trivandrum to New York via Dubai. I have been a regular customer on Emirates Airlines for the last 5 years and chose this airline over many others because of the great service in the past. However in my most recent travels I have experienced poor management of flight connections in Dubai Airport. Due to this I have missed several flights to New York have been stranded in Dubai for days have lost or missed my baggage or have had to run at top speed to barely make it to my gate on time. There is technically only a tight 1 hour and 15minute layover in Dubai but lately the flight from TRV to Dubai has been arriving 3045 minutes late due to an inability to get a gate. This of course suggests poor planning and organizing on your airlines behalf. This delay leaves about 20 minutes for us to deboard the plane figure out our new gate clear security twice and arrive at our departing flight. It is almost impossible to do this especially for customers who are first time travelers older disabled or impaired. As an asthmatic the marathon run I had to make from Terminal C to Terminal A led to bad wheezing and could have resulted in a medical emergency if I had not carried my inhaler. Several times we only barely made our Dubai to JFK flight because we paid for preferred seats in the front of the plane allowing us to leave quickly. Despite experiencing this incredibly stressful connection Emirates staff provides no support to help us off the flight quickly. In fact on our December 12th flight when we alerted the flight attended about our very tight connection EK201 was already boarding when we landed she dismissively told us everyone has a connection flight not just you. She also argued with my father and I for 5 minutes further delaying our exit from the plane. This is poor management and could be remedied by announcing the names of passengers with very tight connections. However it seems Emirates no longer cares about their customers. Due to our marathon run we did make our flight on December 12th but my relief was shortlived. We were informed that all 3 of our checked bags were not loaded and would instead arrive on EK203 on December 13th at 800 am. On December 13th I called the Emirates number for baggage services at 9am and was told my bags had arrived and JFK and needed to clear customs before it was delivered to my home. I was also informed that I would be updated on my baggage status which did not occur. My family and I were put through hell to get our baggage back. We had to contact Emirates 57 times within the day. At one point a chat service agent gave us conflicting information insisting that our baggage was still in Dubai despite being told otherwise many times. Ultimately after and exhausting flight and while still jetlagged we had to stay up until 230 am calling both Emirates and the delivery company Bex every hour till our bags were delivered. Due to the issues detailed above my family and I have decided to no longer fly Emirates. . I used to be a loyal customer but your company has really gone down the drain these past few flights and loyalty is not a good enough reason to suffer during my travels. Horrible Service. Horrible Airline.
Since the beginning of this pandemic they stopped answering their phone calls only automated replies via emails. Is there any one knows any other airline told their customers that refunding their tickets will be processed only after 1 year of the issuing date. Is this even legal
All was good. I recommend this airline. Airplane is quite new seats are comfortable. Timing is good. Personal is friendly. Overall I am satisfied with the service
Will never fly this airline again. Got stuck on the plane at the airport for an hour and a half because they lost a booklet and couldnt leave without it but still decided to proceed with boarding so all of us were stuck in our seats. The flight attendants were extremely rude and unprofessional if I treated paying customers at my job the way the flight attendants treated me I would be fired immediately I have no idea how thats allowed. Waste of my money I get its a discount airline but I only saved 50 and my experience was 100 times worse than any other flight. There was way more wrong but unfortunately and Ive reached out to the airline to resolve the issues but they didnt care and had no interest in resolving anything and their response was rude as well. Im surprised the airline hasnt gone out of business if this is how they usually are towards everyone. I love flying and they made me never want to fly again
I planned to go to Singapore in early February 2023 and booked a flight from Bangkok to Singapore with Thai Lion Air 3 weeks in advance. But 4 days before my trip I received an email from the airlines informing me that my flight was rescheduled from Feb 1 to Feb 2. I contacted the airlines customer service to ask for rescheduling reasons and how they could help me but they couldnt provide me any reasons why they rescheduled my flight. They gave me 3 options for fixing my problems rescheduling flight keep flight credit cancel and refund. I chose the last one because I lost my trust and wasnt confident to fly with Thai Lion Air because they couldnt explain what happened to my flight. I asked them if there was any flight a day before and after my trip and they said yes but in the same time they didnt tell me any information about my rescheduled flight. They said they wouldnt give me a full refund because rescheduling didnt affect a return ticket. I contacted them 3 times to ask for reasons but no response. I even complained at the front desk at the airport but I wasnt sure if theyd take any actions for improving their service. After I finished a process of refund which I didnt receive a full refund I contacted travel insurance agency Muang Thai Insurance who is the partner with Thai Lion Air. The agency told me that they couldnt let me claim my insurance because they needed the reasons why my flight was rescheduled or cancel. I said I didnt know because the airlines didnt provide me anything. So the agency said it was my responsibility to contact the airline. I felt like I was taken advantage of by the airline and my travel plan was ruined. I had flown with Thai Lion Air before and I didnt think it was bad. The seat was comfy and the service was good back then. But I didnt know what happened to them right now. So I wont recommend any travelers to fly with Thai Lion Air. Its not worth your money and time. This is the worst airlines Ive flew with ever
Apart from friendly crew theres very little to praise KLM. They try to come across glossy and trendy with their ads and brochures and websites but their product is terrible. Im a Gold member only out of necessity as love in Amsterdam and theyre airline need to use most weekends. They only offer a cheese sandwich on European flights which excludes anyone with wheat or gluten or dairy intolerances. Theres no alternative. Though I got their gluten free meal on this long haul and it was inedible. And of course no mid flight snacks provided unlike for everyone else. Tip bring your own snacks with you. Long haul entertainment is extremely limited. Bring your own device and streaming service. They have little on offer and any tv series are never from the beginning. Whats the point in starting a new show youve not seen before on Season 4 Episode 8 Flights are nearly always delayed again I fly with them almost every weekend. Almost without fail. I expect a delayed message from them every Friday before I set out for Schiphol. Their lounge in Schengen zone of Schiphol is truly dreadful too busy hardly any food or drinks on offer. However theyre second lounge for non Schengen is very good and praise where praise is due. I just wish theyd stop discrimination against people with food allergies. Bring in a buy on board like most airlines and therefore have a selection to choose from people would pay. Getting your bags back has improved though I see from messages below its still an issue. Plus they arent cheap. So no bang for your buck.
I was due to fly from Bonaire to Miami on 128 connecting in Curacao at 1020am with Insel Air. I had purchased Tickets with a different airlines to take me much later from Miami to Denver. Late on the night of 127 the airline emailed me to say that my morning flight was cancelled for mechanical reasons and since they dont answer their phones nor does their website work I had to report to the airport early on the morning of 128 to find out what their plan was for rerouting me. After numerous lines bouncing back and forth since neither knew what was happening they said to go ahead and take the flight to Curacao but then they would not be responsible for me getting to Miami from there. My other option was to spend the night in Bonaire and we would try again same schedule the next morning. After much negotiation between the airline and all my fellow passengers who were trying to get to Miami they agreed to put us up in hotel that night pay for our meals and we would try same thing in morning of 129. I rebooked my American connection with at 209 change fee and trusted all would be well in morning. Around 6pm on 128 I learned by email that the flight from Curacao to Miami time had changed to much later in the day once again rendering my American connection on 129 useless and leaving me having to look for lodging in Miami once I arrived and another flight from Miami to Denver on my own. On the morning of 129 I reported to the airport early again to board my first leg. I had nearly checked in when once again they cancelled the 2nd leg from Curacao to Miami for mechanical reasons. At that point I had to get home. I booked a horrendously expensive ticket to get home with another airline and watched all the others who were trying to figure out what to do after this connection cancelled again scurrying around looking for help. My return trip from Bonaire tripled in cost due to this airline leaving me stranded for 2 days. To avoid a travel nightmare dont book with this airlines.
Terrible experience. We booked and paid in advance for my daughter to have an escorted flight from Hamburg to Bristol as she is only 13. When we arrived at the airport we were informed that this service was not available. We therefore had to remain at the airport until she was ready to board however having not expected to be in this situation and therefore not having our passports with us we were unable to be with her in the boarding lounge. The flight was delayed by over 3 hours so having arrived at 1130hrs for a 1320hrs flight we ended up having to remain at the airport until 1700hrs when her flight eventually boarded. During the interim period there was no information on what was happening with the flight or whether indeed it would leave that day until 20 minutes before boarding. When she arrived in Bristol once again there was no escort available and she was escorted through by a steward from another airline. When I complained about the failure to honour the service booked and requested compensation this was initially agreed by email but the flight delay compensation refused. When I pointed out our statutory right this was then reversed and the only compensation for the flight delay paid after nearly 2 months. They didnt even reimburse the cost of the meal which we were entitled to due to the delay and refused to enter into any further correspondence once the flight delay compensation was paid.
Currently seated in St. Kitts airport waiting on LIAT for the second day in a row. Flight was supposed to be at 11.30 it is 1.30. So far two announcements saying they will make more announcements later. Announcements with announcements about future announcements is all they can announce. This may be my second day trapped in St. Kitts airport but I will not give in and buy a one way ticket home on a different airline for twice what I paid for this one only because they will not refund my ticket. Do not use this airline if you are on a tight itinerary. You need hours possibly days between flights in order to meet your connections on time. Certainly do not vacation while flying liat because their idea of your vacation is in the airport.
One of the worst airlines Ive ever traveled with. The extra legroom seats are a total joke and legroom in the normal seats is atrocious. The staff were very unprofessional. Passengers with luggage in front of their feet in the first row of the sections window blinds down seats reclined and tray tables out all during takeoff. The flight attendant on our side did not perform the safety briefing at all. He was too busy messing with overhead baggage and it wasnt until we took off that I realized he hadnt done it.
Staff are lovely but the food was very poor you dont even get a bread roll. I am a small person so I was ok but for a man not sure how they would go. However they were very generous when it came to wine.
I was asleep most of the flight. I must add there was a lot of turbulence during the flight more than Im used to and Im an experienced flyer. I also would like to add please come at least two and a half hours before the flight since it is international. I saw a lot of negative reviews based solely on not knowing this piece of information and the crew not making exceptions. The crew are really nice. One of them spilled water on me Im unsure if she apologized or not because it woke me up from my sleep. But she handed me some napkins to dry myself off so Im assuming it was an accident. The aircraft was very spacious. I had a lot of leg room the seats actually reclined and youre able to view the plane from different angles via the camera that are set up on it. Ive never seen a feature like that before and thought that was pretty unique. All and all if Im ever going to Europe again Im flying with them for sure.
I did not succeed in releasing boarding pass on internet. Ticket was bought in 2017 on Internet. Credit card was immediately charged. Now at airport in May 2018 because the airline requested the original credit card. As bank had released a new one and changed the ultimate 4 digits my checkin was initially put in hold during 20 minutes. At last chief appeared and I was compelled to sign a document where I would authorize a new charge. Extremely unpleasant. Plane was 1 hour late. Food was very poor.
I was rather underwhelmed by the new Istanbul Airport. To say that the airport resembled a construction site would be a understatement. TK has a few checkin counters operational for limited international operations. Self checkin kiosks were not available yet. No fast track either for security or passport control. No lounge just a makeshift arrangement with limited service. Quite a major step backwards to the current arrangement for BC and TK FFs at Ataturk airport. The terminal also rather unremarkable compared to other major hubs around the globe. Boarding uneventful and not very organized in typical TGS fashion. On board TK is very good as usual. Excellent breakfast served with inspiring menu and attentive crew. The hard product also very good with 2x2 seating IFE and fresh looking cabin on this relatively new 737800. On time departure and arrival. Would have appreciated a fast track arrangement for TK premium passengers at GYD.
Manchester to Tenerife. On the morning of our flight TUI informed us that due to scheduling issues they have enlisted Privilege style as a charter airline. The seat was comfortable only issues were my tray table was loose the window was in a position that caused pain on my neck to look out of it. The interior felt somewhat tired. Apart from this the flight was comfortable and landed safely.
Goa to Mumbai. Flight was cancelled without any notice. Jet Airways flight status page was even still showing an ontime then arrived status. Heard of 3 other flights cancelled in same conditions that day. No refunds offered on spot had to refer to our travel agents.
British Airways is late their website is atrocious and they wouldnt let me checkin until 24 hours before the flight. I have been trying for 6 hours to check in through their website andor find a real person to speak with. Customer service had such a thick accent I didnt think they were speaking English.
At Denpasar airport we were not given the boarding pass for the next trip as Cathay Pacific said we would get them at a transit desk in HK. But once arrived in Hong Kong we asked to all transit desks and all said Turkish airline had no transit desks in HK airport. We had to get out go through custom and do the check in again and we only had 1 h to do everything we almost missed the next flight. My vegan food was tasteless.
SINVTE return. Brand new plane same plane both ways. Adequate legroom. Decent meal served. Flight attendants have a tendency to chat to each other while serving. Inseat PTVs but no headphones were given out so bring your own 2pin earphones. Both flights were on time.
What an amazing airline. I was travelling with my family back home to Canada from Pakistan. Qatar Airways made sure that we have the most pleasant experience with them. My kids were provided with little stuffs toys and coloring books. I was provided with a pack of essentials stuff for my Infant like diaper wipes baby powder baby lotion. Moreover they even gave me baby food for my Infant which I forgot to request in advance. Service was amazing. Flight attendant are wonderful. Entertainment system is awesome. Food is Delicious. I would definitely rate this the airline 1010.
As described in my review yesterday Vueling Customer Service Dept informed me on both outward and return flights that they could not validate my documents without indicating what the problem was thus preventing me from checking in online. I drafted a complaint providing full details of the totally inadequate service provided by Customer Service and sent it to them yesterday. I have just received their response a pro forma apology shorter than the one they sent me after my outward flight. Not a word about the specific points outlined in my complaint and no explanation of why the could not validate my documents. My request for an explanation was the key point of my complaint because I want to know what happened so that I can avoid any repetition. I sent an immediate reply to their apology and by automatic reply I received this message Dear customer We inform you that this email address has been deactivated. We are pleased to inform you that our Customer Service communication channels have changed in order to be able to offer you a better service. An excellent case of Vuelings actions speaking louder than their words.
The trip was nice and i think it was pretty good. The food was nice and it was good since you didnt exactly need premium food. there was a chocolate pudding beeffishlamb stew couscous with chickpeas or pasta some biscuits and a drink. I thought it was pretty good and the flight had screens and the staff was very nice and kind. My only problem was that when we landed the Ethiopian and other people just pushed everyone out their way. I soon figured that out also in the Ethiopian airport the next day when we boarded our plane to the Seychelles. Overall I would recommend.
April 15 LHRSydney via Singapore. I flew First as part of a promotion for no additional cost with purchase of business seat on SYDLHR leg. I really enjoyed the Concorde Room at Terminal 5 lovely meal great service and very elegant space. In terms of the flight the FA were very friendly and helpful on all legs. They went out of their way to make you feel special and a guest. Food was very good as was wine offering. Seat was comfortable and roomy although there is a lot less storage then in CX Business Seat. In fact while there is a lot of room much of it really is not that useful. At night FA did disappear for much of the time and didnt really come around except once to offer waterjuice. Whereas on SQ economy FA would check on you regularly throughout flight. While of course it is very special to fly First next time I would be just as happy to fly CX Business which I think is really great value for money and the seats are just as or maybe even more comfortable. If I had paid full fare for this flight I think I would have been questioning the value for money.
I fly this route from Malta to Amsterdam almost every week and try to avoid Air Malta as much as possible but sometimes this is not possible even prefer an indirect flight over a direct Air Malta flight. Recently additional surprises occurred. For months now when flying Air Malta you get a Latvian old lease Boeing no room fully booked.
The flight to Singapore was okay at best seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours still counting no information were given to us no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all they promised information that never came.
Singapore to Denpasar. Having experienced Uniteds version of the B787 this was an opportunity to revisit the experience on SQ instead on a short 2.5 hour flight. The initial entrance into the economy cabin is certainly more welcoming than Uniteds experience. Once seated you notice the highdensity thin seat cushions which give you more perceived legroom than the standard 32 in pitch would suggest. Because SQ stayed with the 333 configuration the seat width is narrower than the comparable A330 or B777 experience and I certainly felt this was the case despite the very narrow armrests. Certainly the aisles are narrow and in the aisle seat I was constantly jostled by passengers and assorted bags during the boarding process. I also found it hard to get comfortable on the thinner seats though this was less of an issue for a shorthaul flight. The IFE was a class above Uniteds with a large vibrant touchscreen and the newest KrisWorld experience minus the seat controller so all interactions are via the screen. Meals were reasonably good if not outstanding while service on the inbound flight to SG was warm and friendly. I wish that cabin seat space for Economy passengers could be maintained given that the vast majority of us travel this way.
Belgrade to Kiev. My experience with Air Serbia did not start well whilst I was booking my ticket online I was asked me for my Visa details for Ukraine despite the fact that im a British citizen and dont need a Visa. The online form would not allow me to skip this information so I ended up having to call customer service. To be fair to Air Serbia it was not difficult to get through to an agent and the phone call was charged at a normal rate. Once I was connected to an operator we cleared up the issue and then the lady said Oh by the way I can see you have not paid for any luggage. I told her with some indignation that I had paid for an extra suitcase and eventually she found this to be correct. Between then and my flight I also received numerous emails telling me that I had not paid for luggage Once I arrived at the airport the idiocy continued on Air Serbias part I was once again asked for my Visa and the check in person had to call someone to ask them if I needed Visa. Eventually someone confirmed I did not. Then they said again Did you know that you havent paid for extra luggage Speechless Once on the plane everything was fine I will try to avoid this airline in future they are also exorbitantly expensive on many routes
We had booked our Trip Through Goibibo for the early flight via NOK AIR from Phuket to Bangkok On 21 sep 2022 at 7.45 AM. On reaching the airport at 6 AM it was mentioned that the flight got cancelled but we were not informed about the cancellation through any means prior or after. When we tried to contact their NOK AIR office at Phuket airport it was closed. Then we had booked another flight through AirAsia and reached Bangkok and enquired at Nok air office at Bangkok. They told that it will be refunded after 45 days and no other proper response. Even in call center number there was no response.
London to Riyadh via Istanbul. I booked a seat by the window on the righthand side. The flight left at 0120 so I expected to be able to sleep. On going through the gate security the staff scribbled out the seat number and wrote the same row 31 I believe the second to last row but wrote seat E. I asked why and they said the plane had been changed but it was the same size as the first leg and I was supposed to be in the exact same seat 31F. I tried to engage them further but they just waved me off. The flight attendants on board said the flight was overbooked which was a lie. The person next to me who had taken my seat was a woman with a crying baby. I said nothing to her as that would be rude and Im not as rude as Turkish Airlines staff. This is by no means the first time it has happened but only seems to be leaving or entering Saudi Arabia. Sometimes I appreciate a woman doesnt want to be seated next to a male stranger but this woman was still next to me and had the side of the plane to lean on exactly why I chose to book the seat in advance instead of just turning up knowing the staff will steal someone elses. One good point was she had a huge blow up cushion between her and the aircraft window which I will look for and use when I fly in future with a different airline of course.
Had a very bad experience with Kulula flying from Johannesburg to Cape Town. I had picked exit row seats when purchasing the tickets months in advance. When we go to leave the bags at the counter they said the flight had changed. They reassigned seats and I asked them to make sure to give us exit row seats. They agreed and said we had exit row seats. One of our group had a check in bag 2 kg over the limit. The other check in bags were 6 kg 2 kg and 1 kg under the limit. But they said for the 2 kg overage which would cost us R300 or we have to move things around. So after 5 minutes of shuffling things around they say we are good to go. Once we get onboard we realize not only are these not exit row seats but we can not recline the seat back. Customer service is deplorable.
Inverness to Auckland via Singapore with British Airways. Service was very good but comfort was very bad for a 14 hour I had no more leg room than I did for an hour flight. I was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer I have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights.
I want to thank a guy that help me with my luggage documentation. I believe his name was Edgardo. Im not too sure of his name but thanks to him I was able to take my luggage.
Newark to Kozhikode via Dubai. I am rating the airline prior to my flight 83019. I am a disabled person seeking medical assistance in getting from the plane door to my seat. I filled out the medical information form got it signed by the doctor and sent it off to the airline. Now I am calling each day trying to get necessary approvals for them to help me on my upcoming flight. Customer service is helpless they are at the mercy of the Medical Assistance dept who are unreachable. They keep telling me that my onward journey from Dubai is on a code share airline FlyDubai and that airline has to approve my medical condition before Emirates can do the same. I booked an Emirates flight in the USA and paid the airline. Emirates put me on a code share flight with FlyDubai. I filled out the medical form for Emirates airlines. How is it my responsibility to get approvals from FlyDubai and airline that does not do business in the USA or have a telephone number Since Emirates is the primary airline they should get the necessary clearances from the other airline and get my special needs taken care of. The callous attitude of all the Emirates staff I have interacted with is shameful. I have called over 15 times in the past 4 weeks to get the situation taken care of but Emirates is not bothered and just refuses to help me. Makes my situation worse than it already was as I prepare to board the flight for medical treatment in India. Help Someone
Terrible service. I try to cancel my trip and get any credit for that and travel after this COVID situation. I called many times and nobody answer phone. I sent e mail but no luck. They have requested place but its to hard to find it. They made everything confused for costumers. I know that this a low cost company but they need to have a better customer service.
The worst airline I have ever flown with. I booked and paid a premium for seating in row seven. Online check in allocated the three of us row 25. I emailed Vistara three days prior to our departure explaining that when checking in online we had been allocated the incorrect seats. No response was received. Airport check in staff either couldnt or wouldnt correct the obvious error and didnt seem care even though one person in our group had mobility issues. There response was that they were only responsible for checking in and it wasnt their problem. So now I have to fill out paperwork to claim a refund for the seating I booked and paid for which was allocated to someone else. Also the people in row 24 were totally ignorant of normal polite inflight protocol and reclined their seats which affected the person in our group with the mobility issue. We asked them to be not recline their seats but all to no avail. Eventually after a vocal exchange with these people a flight attendant moved them to different seats. The whole experience was extremely disappointing and very unprofessional.
Deceptive gate agent in origin city resulted in over charge for baggage upon arrival to Keflavik. Obtuse customer service became condescending and did not resolve my issues. I do not recommend traveling with them.
SriLankan Airlines refund policy due to Covid19 situation is unacceptable we are due to fly 3rdJune 2020 for 30th wedding anniversary. Obviously due to travel restrictions we will be unable to travel due to statement from airline all fees will be waived up to 30th May 2020 if cancelled. If i cancel or wait for cancellation they will class us a no show and then charges fees. Will be applied they say all flights operating month of June Their own website states see below So if i cancel i will incur all cancellation charges totally unacceptable Suspension of Visa in Sri Lanka Below restrictions were imposed by the Department of Immigration and Emigration of Sri Lanka in the light of coronavirus COVID19 outbreak. All types of visa issuance to enter Sri Lanka for all the foreign nationalities will be temporarily suspended until further notice Further all types of Electronic Travel Authorizations ETA Entry Visas Landing endorsements Multiple Entry Visas and Resident Visas already granted to all the foreign nationals and not arrived in Sri Lanka yet will be temporarily suspended and they will not be allowed to enter Sri Lanka until further notice.

Southampton To Angers return. On time attentive staff champagne nice snacks totally perfect. I notice some people complaining about the prices In my opinion the price reflects the service and represents excellent value for money. I hope they continue with these lesser used routes.
Took advantage of promotional fares on Turkish Airlines new route when I booked from Istanbul to Phuket. When I arrived in Phuket on the outbound sector I asked Thai Airways whether on my return I could book a flight with them to Phuket and through check my luggage onto Turkish Airlines both being Star Alliance. He checked on a list and said I could as Thai have an agreement with Turkish. However when I got to Bangkok to fly to Phuket and on to Istanbul Thai said no I couldnt through check in. Where the agreement failed I have no idea. So had to sit with my luggage for hours waiting for Turkish checkin to open. After checkin Business Class passengers were personally escorted through Immigration and Security checks and into a lounge. Not the best lounge in the world but quiet and with light snacks available. Offer of shoulder massage was tempting but I just wanted to close my eyes for an hour. At boarding time we were escorted to the gate and given immediate boarding. Before takeoff given menus and was asked to complete my breakfast choices. After takeoff breakfast was served. I had ordered scrambled eggs but when they reached me in row Four they said they had all gone. They offered an omelette or waffles the latter not being on the menu. After breakfast I made up my bed and slept for hours. We had been asked for our lunch selection from the menu. Cabin was crowded must have been full or close to it. During the night I went to the toilet. The flight deck door was wide open and it looked crowded in there too with some crew standing. In the morning they started the lunch service. In front of me I heard a lady complain and say But I ordered it. When they reached me they said they didnt have the steak I had asked for. I could have the other menu options or a beef stew option which also was not in the menu. I guess the lady had also been disappointed about steak. Landed about 30 minutes early and taken by bus to the terminal special bus for Business Class passengers. After customs I went to the arrival lounge but it was closed. In fact I have often found it closed recently. Overall very good flight. On time. But seems you need to sit in the first couple of rows to be sure of meal choice when flight is full as they only serve from the front in Business Class.
I have flown with them three times now and they are always late sometimes due to weather and are small planes so I understand. Meant to fly from Pokhara to Kathmandu on 18th but cancelled due to storm the staff are so disorganised you have to fight through the Nepalese to get to the desk. Chaos but flew out the next morning which was late of course. Staff are always lovely.
I flew Turkish Airlines from Chicago to Istanbul and back both flights were good some delay leaving Chicago. Inflight service was good flight attendants very pleasant and helpful. I look forward to fly Turkish Airlines again.
LGWBKK. Old Thai Airways 747 but service and food excellent. Had emergency exit seat but so few people on flight 3 seats were possible for lots of people to stretch out. BKKLGW Old jumbo emergency exit seat again but only 120 passengers I have never seen so many people sleeping They cant keep going with this loading. Again staff and food excellent. Fuel stop in Dubai though. Paid 313 all in. Will travel again and hope for same luck.
Worst service ever. I had my kid who is one year old. Even after pressing buzzer airhostess on that day didnt care to give a glass of water. She just switched off the buzzer and left us. I had a great experience travelling from London to Bahrain the staff were very considerate. But Bahrain to Cochin was one of the worst.
The highquality service of the flight attendants as always led me to write this comment. The epidemic has greatly affected the global economy and airlines around the world are no exception. However all flight attendants continue to maintain HNAs excellent service standards especially for the business class FA. I believe I will continue to choose Hainan Airlines flights in the future
The checkin process at JFK T4 was seamless. We got access to the Wingtips Lounge which was fine but there was nothing to be excited about. Boarding was orderly despite the fact that there were many passengers our A380 flight that night was almost full. On board the seat looks nice and comfortable though one of the windows is blocked by the seat design. Staff were nice and attentive something you would expect from SQ anyway. The food was excellent I booked my main course from the BooktheCook menu. The flight arrived in Frankfurt a bit late but not a problem at all. Overall this is what a good flight should be.
I was supposed to go from Madrid to Jakarta on business class on November 9. In Madrid I got my boarding pass up to Jakarta. My flight from Madrid to Paris was AF 1801 on November 9. This flight arrived late it landed at 20.15 approximately. I did inform the cabin crew that I had an AF transfer to Singapore they said that operations were informed and there would be no problem. I rushed to gate K30 and I arrived at 20.30 approximately. So 20 minutes before departure. I was told that I was too late. I said that I was in time that the AF plane from Madrid was late that they knew about it that the plane was still at the boarding gate. The only reply I got was that there were procedures. This of course is totally unacceptable. Why an AF plane cannot wait 10 minutes a passenger who is slightly late because the incoming flight also from AF is slightly late With already a boarding pass. Is this an AF procedure To disregard information showing that a passenger will be slightly delayed due to well documented late arrival I took the same flight the following day and the last passenger boarded after 20.45. Did the procedures change I also just want to mention that I was offered a night in a hotel of medium category in a totally lost area. No compensation whatsoever was offered. I of course had no clothing to change and also not any warm cloth. I also had no opportunity to buy it. Even if this is not a reason for a different treatment I will mention that I was travelling business class and that I am a gold frequent flyer with AF. And that I never saw anything similar in all my life. What a shame
I flew RBA from Kota Kinabalu to London via Bandar seri Begawan and Dubai on 30 December 2016. We experienced a delay in Dubai for almost 16 hours due to fog in the UAE. I understand that this is beyond the control of RBA. However the appalling situation was that there was no proper communication and no RBA ground staff in Dubai airport to assist stranded passengers. Either the RBA staff have taken off their uniform not wanting to face the frustrated customers Im not entirely sure but they cannot be identified at all. We arrived into Dubai at approximately 1.30 a.m. from Brunei and have been stranded until 5.20 p.m on 31 December 2016. With such a long delay we should have been given a hotel. We were also not given any meal voucher but was told to go to either McDonalds or KFC for meals. Upon reaching the McDonalds counter I was told I could only choose either a beef or chicken meal But I am a vegetarian and I was told they could not help me without RBA authorisation. But there was no RBA ground staff to be seen I was supposed to reach London at about 6.40 a.m. on new years eve to celebrate the countdown with my wife and children but we only arrived at 9.30 p.m. into Heathrow. As I live in Somerset I only reached home at 12.30 a.m. on new years day to a disappointed family I thought RBA has improved with the service after many years for not flying with the airline but I now feel I have made a terrible terrible mistake in choosing RBA once again with this trip.
Great experience from start to finish. Checkin agent very polite and efficient. Priority given for security checks. They use the Air New Zealand lounge great one with lots of food and beverage choices great seating spaces. Boarding a bit late due to weather conditions at SYD airport. Once on board the A380 feels spacious and very comfy. FAs are great they give a superb infligth experience. The only thing that needs to be improved is the IFE not a big selection of movies. Food and wine selection great for business class. The korean meal experience if you choose to try it is really good. Seat comfy and lots of space around. Overall a great experience and got in a taxi short 30 mins after arrival.
I had the misfortune of booking a flight on Emirates for my daughter to fly as an unaccompanied minor. All flights were expensive so I used an app to find some cheaper flights and booked on line. I must mention that I checked with their terms and conditions to make sure I could call and change the flight to an unaccompanied minor. Firstly I never received the itinerary so I called Emirates to get this sent. Secondly I could barely understand the operator as he mumbled and had a strong accent. Once I had the itinerary I then told them I needed the unaccompanied minor added. Because I had booked flights operated by Emirates but run by Qantas I needed to call Qantas to make the change. So I called Qantas they had no record of the flights then told me I need to change through the airline I booked. I called Emirates again and explained they then said I assure you it needs to be done by Qantas. I went back and forth from airline to airline multiple times until Emirates then said there is no way I can change to unaccompanied minor and Qantas would not change it either I finally had enough and asked to speak to someone who knew what they were doing. I spoke to a supervisor who was not rude or anything but stated Id need to cancel the flight take the hit and rebook via phone. I dont think so referring to their website that says booking electronically then adding a service is perfectly acceptable. So now I have return tickets in my daughters name that we cant use. This is bordering on criminal if not unethical Airlines are supposed to be helpful not members of the Wit family
Singapore to Penang. I was running late and met this very helpful ground staff helped to speed up my checkin using the automated system and completed it within a couple of minutes. She does the job with professionalism and a smile. If more airline staffs are like her it will help take away some of the hassle of air travel.
Shanghai to Hong Kong. I was arranged to an earlier flight on that day. The ground staff was very efficient. The seat was quite standard. The IFE had a wide range of movies selection. Ford and drinks was great better than Cathay Pacific ones. Crew is friendly.
Barcelona to Melbourne via Singapore a terrific flight on Singapore Airlines. Comfortable seats great food and wines and exemplary staff. Both crews were very attentive and worked hard to ensure we had good flights. The new A350 seats are welldesigned and the Inflight entertainment is easy to use with big screens. I have seen better videos choices but the offer on SIA is good.
Despite the poor reviews I kind of had to use Safi on the Dubai to Kabul route. I was pleasantly surprised that we got reasonably new A320s with normal leg room and the planes were dead on time.
Birmingham to Hong Kong via Paris. I booked a flight with Air France a return flight from Hong Kong to Birmingham. I was unable to fly on the outbound flight as I had flown to Europe a few days earlier on a Business Trip. I informed the airline of this Air France stating that I still intended to take the inbound return flight from Birmingham to Hong Kong. I arrived at the airport for the inbound return flight as per my itinerary only to be told by the Air France staff that my flights had been cancelled and I would be unable to fly unless I paid a 500 Euros administration charge to get my flights reinstated. Air France had not informed me that my flights had been cancelled at any point despite numerous correspondences during the prior month. I then had to pay a significant amount of money to fly on a flight that I had already paid to fly on. It caused me an incredible amount of distress and embarrassment as well as the obvious personal financial cost. To make matters worse I was treated exceptionally badly by the Air France staff at Birmingham airport. Why was I not notified that my full journey had been cancelled because of not taking the outbound flight All in all a terrible experience.
Bangkok to London. This is my 6th flight to Thailand with Eva. I no longer bother with Premium Economy as the Economy class is a very good product. Although the aircraft was over 10 years old it was smart and spotless everything worked. The food and staff were excellent. Eva was a delight. Spacious clean all full service amenities offered down to a toothbrush toothpaste. The staff were great which altogether made for a very pleasant 12 hour journey.
Flew Bali to Singapore. Jetstar Asia was an impressive and great airline to travel with. Boarding commenced on time which was great. The crew were also cheerful and friendly. When conducting onboard service the crew were also careful and considerate. It was overall a great flight and I would definitely fly Jetstar Asia again.
New York to Tel Aviv via Baku. A very pleasant experience. I originally selected Azerbaijan Airlines for its low price alone. I was not expecting a great experience and that was OK for the money saved. However the flight was very pleasant overall. There were no delays the planes were clean and well kept the food was good and the air crews were friendly. Heydar Aliyev airport in Baku is beautiful. Clean and looks new. If you are willing to put up with a longer overall flight to Tel Aviv from NYC in exchange for a lower fare Azerbaijan Airlines is a very good choice. The only downsides are no inflight wifi and the entertainment selection could be more current. On the plus side the 787 that they fly for the long haul to Baku does have individual USB ports to keep a phone charged so you could download a movie you want beforehand and watch it without your phone dying. The B757 that you transfer to to go from Baku to Tel Aviv is pretty basic but they do feed you and that leg of the trip is short.
Cali to Quito with a stop in Tulcan and connecting flight to Guayaquil. All flights were on time. The CaliQuito leg was in a Embraer 170 quite confortable and in a 45 min flight form Cali to Tulcan free drinks full lunch and duty free service was performed by nice flight crew. The Quito Guayaquil leg was an A320 quite comfortable as well. Once again snack and drinks were served on a 30 min flight. Tame is quite a good option for flying within Ecuador and to Colombia new planes great staff.
Having flown KE several times now I found the experience from start to finish quite predictable. Their Y product is definitely above average and surpasses most of the competition with good meals generous leg room and great inflight customer service. There was a downside to this trip however. My seat became defective as the recline lever wouldnt return the seat back to its upright position but kept reclining. The steward attempted to rectify it but the problem only repeated once I reclined after meal service. Moreover KALs AVOD system isnt my favorite as the selections are limited and feels oriented primarily for a Korean audience. All in all it was a solid experience and Id fly again if the price Is right.
Barcelona to Doha had a delay for more than an hour due to bad weather situation in Barcelona so it means I will be late on my next flight to Manila. After more than an hour of waiting we finally left the airport. It was a smooth flight and the service is also good. On arrival to Doha a proactive ground crew approached us to make some remedy for the flight that we had missed. He said that our flight is rebooked for the next day and they will send us in a hotel. The hotel was more than enough to my expectation and meal allowance is included. The staff of the hotel are also welcoming and hospitable and I also had the chance to meat my friend who is working in the Bank in Doha. He serve as my tour guide when we walk around the city. Thank you Qatar Airways for making my Doha journey a memorable one.
Turkish Airlines denied boarding for some apparent miscommunication between Turkish Airlines and the Turkish Government according to the last communication from Turkish the government put out on December 30 2020 effective immediately a requirement for COVID 19 test for transit passengers. According to Turkish this requirement was voided on same day 12302020 however Turkish failed to communicate to the passengers the new requirement. I had called on 12292020 to verify if we needed a test and Turkish Call Center indicated no test was required. However I did get an email from Turkish on 12302020 at 7pm when we landed in Houston on another airline at our own expense that passengers in transit in Istanbul did not need a COVID19 test. Turkish Airlines has not assumed the responsibility to communicate the changes or to repair the loses they caused us.
Our family chose Norse Atlantic Airways to fly from Europe to USA in March 2023. Having flown dozens of airlines and hundreds of flights we all agreed this was one of the best experiences. We purchased Premium economy tickets which included seats in front of the plane priority boarding and 2 meals for the fraction of price we would have paid on other airlines. Check in and other services in Oslo were fast and efficient boarding was on time plane was new etc. but the main difference between Norse and other airlines was attitude. Norses team really made this trip more special. Besides being professional there was sincerity. The seats do not recline to a lieflat position but the space in Premium cabin seats is huge. It was a decent meal and the crew went the extra mile to find something different for our kids. Our Premium light tickets included 2 pieces of onboard luggage that was enough for our trip. Overall our experience with Norse Atlantic Airways was great.
Milan to Paris. Ground staff incompetent rigid and impolite. Bureaucracy over flexibility and kindness when dealing with clients. National airline with on point to point flights offer a worse service than lowcost carriers.
Jetstar Pacific is a terrible airline if you have a connecting flight. Had three flights booked to tour Vietnam every one time changed by at least 34 hrs. My last one was to connect with international flight back to UK. The time they changed would have seen me missing a 1000 flight for two people. Had to really argue to get flight to suit eventually they got me flight that left me getting up a 5 am from my holiday resort then hanging around Ho Chi Minh airport for 7 hrs.
Most unpleasant flight ever. Their method of boarding the plane wasnt very Covid19 friendly so if you are someone who is concerned I wouldnt recommend you travel on this airline. Most airlines board back to front to keep crossing paths with others to a minimum. Where as this airline boarding all window seats then all middle the all aisle seats together in bit seat order meaning that there were about 40 people all trying to get ton in each bath and crossing paths. They also wouldnt let you use the overhead lockers above you which causes you having to walk up and down the aisles to find space and then squeezing past people to get back to your seat. The worst thing about the journey was the staff were quite unfriendly and rude. If you want to ruin a relaxing holiday and come back stressed 1010 would recommend
My flight from MEL to NOU was a great experience. The checkin at Melbourne was very fast and efficient. Boarding was on time and the cabin crew were very welcoming and friendly. The plane is newest and safe.The economy class seat have not PTVs but the newest A320 equipped with new video on demand system connected by wifi on your smartphone tablet or computer. After Take off an aperitif followed by a hot lunch was served. however the cabin crew are not very far. My experience on Aircalin is not too bad.
This was my return trip back to the US after 3 weeks in Indonesia and Malaysia. The seat was very comfortable though I did not make use of the sleeping position as it was a day flight and I was not tired. The meal service was impeccable with various options for selection. I selected the filet mignon and it was superb. The service was exceptional and the flight attendant addressed me by name. She was very pleasant and friendly though sometimes I had a little hard time understanding her English. We managed and everything went well. Certainly this would be an awesome seat to fly the 15hour trip. I was very impressed and more so very grateful for the upgrade. That was such a pleasant surprise. I will soon be returning to Indonesia in a few months and there is no other way to fly there for me but EVA Air.
Gatwick to Melbourne via Hong Kong. Have travelled on Cathay every two years or so on this route in business class. Surprised and disappointed to be told on boarding at Gatwick that pyjamas are no longer supplied in what is clearly a long haul overnight flight. A stupid cost cutting measure that trashes Cathays business product. Excellent service and food diminished greatly by this decision. Amusing to see fellow canny passengers sitting up in their Qantas PJs for the flight not a good look Cathay I have contacted customer relations on this matter and received the usual PR blah blah response. Such a shame and a ridiculous decision.
Feeling let down as my bmi Regional flight from Aberdeen to Norwich was due to leave at 3pm today and now find my flight cancelled until 6.25. Having put most people on other aircrafts back I found myself a single lady flyer having further cancellations and am still at 20.52 sitting in Aberdeen airport with my elderly parents waiting to pick me up at the other end which was meant to be at the latest 5.30pm with an hour travelling time to and from airport 7.5 hours delay for an internal flight Really bmi.
My jewel among low cost airlines. Courteous efficient and highly safety oriented cabin crew. Very enjoyable flying experience thru out. Every time the washroom had been used the crew checked it for cleanliness. Great public announcements.
Highly impressed by the hospitable attitude of cabin crew. The cabin crew show utmost respect care and hospitality so a big Thankyou. Ive flown with many different airlines in last 10 yrs and never have i found such a welcoming attitude from any of the crew members as of Qatar Airways.
Return flights from London to Bangkok via Beijing booked with Air China seemed a good price deal but you get what you pay for Bag delayed on outward journey and airline insisted it had to be delivered to my hotel at 3am off a following flight meaning the hotel owner had to get up to receive it despite being told later on would be more acceptable. In flight entertainment was laughable Ive never seen such an antiquated system a total waste of time and definite breach of the word entertainment. Return flight Beijing to London departed around 7am an 11 hour flight. Weather was clear and sunny again the above entertainment system which resulted in looking out of the window at the views below to pass the time or should I say trying to was repeatedly asked by cabin crew to close my blind when I asked why thinking maybe we were flying over a restricted area etc I was told people were trying to sleep apparently Air China think it is ok for passengers not sleeping on a long haul day flight to sit in a completely dark cabin for 11 hrs with no in flight entertainment and a low phone battery staring at the back of the headrest in front If you like either chickenrice or shrimpnoodles youll be fine for food otherwise enjoy the bread rolls I saw being offered as alternatives 5 Next time stick with Thai Airways.
Flew from Washington to Boston on Economy. Arrived at the airport at 5pm for check in for 6.30pm flight. After several gate changes following a series of confusing announcements in an extremely overcrowded terminal the creeping delays started half an hour at the time. After an hour we were informed plane had landed but due to congestion there were no stands available. Finally boarding was announced at around 8.30pm after which it started to rain. We were then informed there would be a further delay due to the rain. We sat on the plane for an hour then taxied to the runway and waited another hour only to be informed that the flight would now be cancelled due to the weather. It was now after 10pm. On disembarking I was fortunate to be near the front so could be attended to quickly at the customer services desk for rebooking but I later realized others were stuck in a queue for hours late into the night. I was told flatly that all flights were full and overbooked until 10pm the next day. I was told rudely to take the 10pm flight or leave it and as it was due to the weather it was not their responsibility to offer anything else in fact the weather was just one of the contributing factors for the cancellation the plane had already been late. I had to push and push to be offered alternative options e.g. flights to a different airport or with layover etc. Eventually they found a flight via Philadelphia the next morning. I asked for more details and then agreed to be put on the flight only to be told I had taken too long to make a decision and now that flight was also full I overheard other passengers being rebooked for other morning flights in adjoining desks so I have no idea what was going on. After much persuasion a seat miraculously became available at 11am the next day. Bizarre. I understand that delays and cancellations are not the fault of the customer service desk but they should at least be courteous understanding and helpful to passengers at a stressful time not dismissive.
Dublin to Paris. Flight cancelled because of the general strike in France. They sent me a link which did not work. Finally had to send a message through Facebook and their website and was told I had to wait 24 weeks to get my money back. In the meantime I had to book another flight with Air France more expensive but at least their service was great. As though this was not enough I received an email inviting me to check in for the cancelled flight and the next day an e mail as to what to do in Paris. After cancelling the flight they should at least take care not to send these annoying messages. This is an airline I will avoid from now on.
My experience with Turkish Airlines was terrible. I booked a flight and an extra seat to go from Brazil to Jakarta with my friend. Even though after booking I figured out that this extra seat was only more space for my flight and could not be used as a flight for him Even though the cost is parity to the thicket I bought for my self. I asked to cancel or transfer the extra seat with less than 24h since I have bought the ticket. Although Turkish Airlines did not allow the cancelation or transference without charge. After many calls without success the company asked me to write a feedback on their website to solve the issue. The took me more than 3 days and the response simply is a standard response that does not fit with the request. I am still waiting for the cancelation or transference of the ticket.
CopenhagenParisZurichParis on 1718 Sep 23 deploying A220300 and A320 aircrafts. Had to position myself in Zurich to catch my Kenya Airways AFcodeshare from there to Nairobi and Joburg. Tricky to checkin the luggage from CPH for the entire trip but by jumping the Zurich part the luggage could be tagged simpler and eventually made it the whole way 5 legs to Joburg. While Zurich became just a turnaround point with the same aircraft the return leg however was in business class a clear step beyond economy though identical modest seats. The checkin in CPH went well but the handling agent deployed by Air France were rigid and uninterested and refused to transfer my luggage beyond the first 2 legs which caused me immense trouble and rebooking in ZRH as I could not catch my onward flight. The timeslot became too narrow to retrieve and recheck in luggage which I already informed of in CPH but in vain we dont do transfer on different tickets despite being the same airline and even on the same returning aircraft. Lounges provided as elite traveller were fine in all three airports. Onboard crew were courteous and effective. The A220 is a blessing likely the best narrow body aircraft I have flown. All flights were clean punctual or early. Service on board very modest but a few drinks hot drinks and snack provided. Huge adavantage being elite FFPtraveller these days accessing their newer lounges and getting other perks.
Brisbane to Zurich via Dubai. After hearing nothing but great things about Emirates I have been left so disappointed. Our first leg from Brisbane to Dubai started with them not giving my 7 year old daughter her meal. Not only did they forget the first meal of the 14hr flight but I had to ask them again for the second meal. Approximately 4 hours out from Dubai the oxygen masks dropped from the panels above. After 15 long minutes we were advised that they thought it is a technical issue. Passengers were then asked to fold up the oxygen masks as best we could and they were left hanging in front of us. Following this there was no inflight entertainment or service for the remainder of the flight. No compensation was offered and staff seemed more concerned about passengers who were recording the incident. After our horrendous flight and poor service from Brisbane I asked at Heathrow about an upgrade and was told flights to Brisbane were fully booked. This was not true as the Dubai to Brisbane leg was half empty and many people had three seats to themselves. The check in procedure at Heathrow we had to use the self service machines and this was not made clear until we had already queued for 25 minutes. There were no toilets in the lounges at Heathrow and Dubai which meant that once you had shown your passport and ticket and gone into the lounge you had to go back outside to the toilets and then queue again. Our flight from London departed at 9pm. My daughter didnt end up getting her meal until 11.50pm. It took them 2.5hrs to commence the meal service. The flight from Dubai to Brisbane was no better. My 7 year old needed to go to the toilet as soon as we got on the plane and the toilet hadnt been cleaned. My 7 year old fell asleep on take off so I asked if her meal could be kept for later when she woke up. I was told this was not a problem however when I asked for it 7 hours later I was told we she couldnt have as they couldnt reheat it. I then had to ask if I could at least get the other food that didnt require being reheated. The customer service on three of the four flights was absolutely appalling. The flight attendants were not pleasant and friendly. On one flight I pressed the buzzer for some water due to my daughter being asleep on me and noone attended at all the plane landed 1.5 hours after I pressed the buzzer and we disembarked. I could not get over the amount of time the seat belt signs came on when there was barely any turbulence. On top of this the excessive amount of time they kept the seatbelt sign on when there was no turbulence was ridiculous. At one point it had been on for over one hour and my daughter needed the toilet. We got up to go to the toilet and I was told I would be going at our own risk. It felt to me that they kept the seat belt sign on for an extended period so the crew got out of doing work. I have travelled extensively for the past 20 years and Emirates is the worst airline I have ever flown with. Do not waste your money. I will never fly with them again.
We had the worst airline experience weve ever had on Play false advertising of free lap infants websites that dont work a bag lost for our whole trip and no real staff to speak with only handling agents who work for other companies and robot chat auto responses. I assumed I could add my infant at inperson checkin but it took a whole hour and we had to pay fees equivalent to 13 of our adult ticket price. When sent the payment link it was asking me to log in and didnt have an option to create an account. It finally worked when I used a different internet browser only to find when I got home that we were charged twice We made our flight just in time only because they boarded late and the ticketing agent escorted us through security but our checked bag never made it to our destination. Upon arrival we and 2 other families from our flight were missing bags and there was no one at the London Stansted airport to help us. Another airlines agent tried and directed us to the online lost baggage form which was not accepting any of our flight numbers. Finally mine worked but the other 2 families had to fill out a paper form. A few days after arrival I received a text that my bag was found and being sent to the airport and that status remained unchanged until I got to the airport to go home a week later. I got useless responses from a WhatsApp bot and never heard back on the email I sent until after I had returned from my trip. My brand new bag now damaged had been at the arrival airport for a few days but the online status system was never updated to reflect that and I never received the email that the manager said she sent me. And the bag was certainly not delivered to my local address as the form said it would. Even after we collected the bag for the return flight the status of the lost bag on route but not yet delivered to the airport was unchanged. For a week my toddler and I went without any of our clothes and without his medicines. It was incredibly frustrating to not have any real person to speak with. I dont know how an airline can operate without staff in their airports and rely on robot communication and websites that dont work. This airline has not invested the human and technology resources they need to support their customers. The inflight experience also sucks. I dont expect the world from a budget airline but 3 for a tiny bottle of water and row screens that only show the flight status that I could never interpret was a huge bummer. The only positive were the flight attendants who were very accommodating of our toddler.
Barnaul to Vienna via Moscow. It was the first routing on Aeroflot for me in many years and I was keen to see if and how their product has changed over time. I had flown the Route VIESVOBAX a week before as well. All sectors were operated by Boeing 737800 aircraft and the planes seemed to be in very good condition from outside and in the cabin. Leg room was very good for economy class the flight attendants were helpful and service was done in a professional manner. On the flight from Moscow to Vienna several passengers who were influenced by alcohol already when they boarded became a nuisance to all others. They disturbed other guests and started to threaten their neighbours after landing in Vienna. The crew did not react to this and even sold alcohol to them. This event had a negative impact to my personal feeling of safety.
While staff are generally friendly on board Hawaiian Airlines flights customer service for anything not in person is unforgivingly terrible. You will spend hours to get the most basic support like rescheduling a ticket. There call center lines occasionally out source to some foreign countries with people who barely speak English and its very disappointing. Hawaiian for then last decade used to be my preferred airlines but with the death of island air and corporate greed caused by COVID youre better off flying Delta or Southwest. Very disappointed with how this company has destroyed its customer service credibility over a few thousand dollars Corporate greed at its finest.
Bangkok to Yangon retjurn in midMay. This is my first experience with this airline and it did not disappoint. The checkin at the airport for both flights were uneventful efficiently handled and most notably having little or no queues which is always a welcomed sight when there are snaking queues at neighbouring counters for other airlines. The boarding for the outgoing flight started a little after the scheduled time. The planes do not have any seatback entertainment units but for the outgoing flight there was onboard wifi which allow you free access to a selection of movies and TV shows on the MAI app which can be preloaded onto phones Ipads etc. The selection was limited. For a 6570 min flight it is impressive that the cabin crew is able to come round with wet tissues followed by a meal and drinks service. The cabin crew were polite and cheerful. The captain made announcements regularly which were spoken in clear English.
Cabin staff was friendly. The gate staff in Pensacola were friendly and informative. However the staff in Tampa at the gate was horrible and did not keep us up to date. She was coming at the passengers like they were committing a crime over not wearing masks and smoking which I did not see anyone not wearing a mask that wasnt eating nor did I see anyone smoking. She was very aggressive with her little announcement. The ticket booth opened up later than the rest of them in the morning and there was not much seating offered at the Pensacola gate. The cabin is tiny and seats are very uncomfortable even for the small duration of the flight. It was hot and we were offered warm water. The worst part of this was that the flight was delayed due to weather in Tallahassee so they unloaded 8 suitcases so that the plane can fly. Nobody was notified. We were all just standing around waiting and I had to start asking around. Silver did not have an office so we had to go to the ticket booth to ask and submit a claim even though my name was not on the list of 8 ppl given to the staff. This is disheartening as I learned that some of the fellow passengers had important medication in their checked bags. If bags must be removed they should certainly ask about who relies heavily on items in their bags to LIVE As it is frustrating to not have my luggage my life doesnt depend on it. The removed luggage was placed on a Delta flight that was not arriving until almost midnight. This is unacceptable I would pay 3x more for a better experience from a flight in the same state.
Los Angeles to London Heathrow. The inflight entertainment was not working so no tv video music or radio. USB socket not working. Headphones not working. Customer service very poor. Cabin crew seemed to be unaware that they were carrying paying passengers upon whom their jobs depend. Food mediocre. There was no apple juice or tomato juice on the dinner trolley and the cabin crew didnt bother to fetch any. Tea served with breakfast was luke warm and stewed. No refreshments supplied unless collected from the galley It took 2 days to get through to customer relations many calls cutting off after 18 minutes others cancelled after going through options. I cannot recommend British Airways who in my case certainly did not fly to serve. The experience was far below expectations and definitely at the lower budget range for customer service. As the British flag carrier the experience was shameful my last flight with this airline.
Very pleasant flying experience very organised boarding procedure. Excellent service quality and quantity was very good. The product is brilliant. Heaps of legroom comfortable reclining seat which allows for some good sleep with nice legfeet support. The IFE is also great. Plenty of movies and series available even pretty new ones. The cabin crew was very friendly. Whenever requested extra drinks or snacks hot cup noodles were provided immediately. Only downside was that through out journey masks had to be worn even while at Hong Kong Airport. Also there were only a limited number of shops and restaurants open at HGK but this has nothing to do with the Cathay.
Boarding in Munich was a rush however business class passengers did receive a welcome drink Greek sparkling wine or water. The lunch had several options and there was a choice between 2 red and white Greek wines. The food was not bad at all. Decent information about the flight was given. FA were courteous and helpful. One of the better business products in Europe for sure. Only luggage was not quite delivered as priority despite labelled.
I am disgusted by the lack of consideration and the dishonesty of this airline. They kept delaying the flight till the airport closed and flight was cancelled. Will not fly with them again.
Flew to Ibiza recently and was over half way there only to be told we had to turn back due to a bird strike. It made no sense to turn back considering we were closer to our destination however the pilot told us they had no engineers on the ground so they had no choice. From this point it was just lie after a lie as each team passed the problem on the next really bad service The pilot told us we would only have to wait on the aeroplane for 15 mins before a new plane arrived to take us to our new destination. I questioned this immediately as its not like buses where you can just send a new one to take passengers to their next destination. Of course when we touched down he then lied and told us to leave the plane and wait for further communication. The ground team then lied to us and told us they would 68 provide free drinks and food on the next flight... so none of us bought any food in the terminal even though we hadnt eaten in over 68 hours. Eventually after waiting over an hour our new plane arrived. We all got on the plane excited to have some food and free drink including alcohol only to be told all that would be on offer is a few kit kats and tea and coffee Literally nothing else was available even to purchase. To summarise this is profits over safety and customer service. I have lodged a formal complaint so will be happy to change my review depending on the outcome however dont have my hopes up
How far BA has sunk Flew London Heathrow to Nice and back last week surly and unfriendly cabin crew food and drinks for purchase. Does BA stand for Budget Airline now I never thought Id see the day when I would say BA has sunk to and below the levels of Ryanair service yet still around 7x more expensive
Mumbai to Seoul Incheon with Korean Air Flight was in time and the food served during flight is very delicious. Excellent service provided by cabin crew and I found the ground service is the best. Good inflight entertainment.
All ANZ flights on this trip were late. This one in particular NZ8 was delayed for an hour with no announcements no explanation no plan for customers who would miss connecting flights. Unacceptable. Skycouch is a nice product but super expensive at 1000 each way when occupied by one person. It works well for 2 children or an adult with 1 child but is too small for 2 adults. Food and what service there is is the same as the rest of economy. The wifi while free did not work.
They have a very strict carry on weight policy of 7KG. I was forced to put 5000 worth of lenses into checked luggage. No option to pay extra wouldnt allow me to book an extra seat to double my luggage rate. Im praying to god they are ok when I land. Staff on the desk didnt seem to grasp why this was such a huge issue or why a photogragher might easily carry more than 7KG in hand luggage.
Volaris initially sold me on their flights due to their promise of lower prices. I even paid to upgrade my seats to the front of the plane and was excited to get a decent deal during a holiday. Upon my initial check in at the airport the problems began. Volaris told me I had two sets of tickets which I was unaware of as I only received one email with one receipt I told them I only wanted one flight and the assistant said she would take care of it. She apparently did and we boarded the plane and vacationed. Upon our attempt to return we were told there was no flight for us as our tickets had been cancelled Upon further review it was found by a Volaris agent that the prior assistant had cancelled the flight I had the paperwork on and had left the other flight open. The issue is the return flight was on different date that was a week prior to our scheduled return date and which we knew nothing about The agents in Guadalajara would not budge and since we have responsibilities we had to get home and had to buy a subsequent return ticket. The agent assured us that the other ticket for a missed flight would be refunded by contacting customer service after we returned. Volaris customer service is basically nonexistent and not of service. You can never get a live person on a phone line unless youre buying a ticket. I used the email link to which Volaris states will be responded to within 2 days Ive written three emails each a week apartand I have had no response I sent a Messenger message and have gotten no response except an animated antiquated number system sending me in a loop. I finally got a horrible response on Whatsapp that told me it was too late to request a refund since I had accepted the initial flight and had missed the return flight. I should state here that the return flight we repaid for was not full either So here I sit with Volaris claiming theres nothing they can dofor their mistakes which as cost me twice what I was originally paying Thus my flight has ended up costing me far more than any other airline wouldve in the first place. Its a scam Volaris doesnt have low fares. Theyre there to cheat you out of your money and your flights. We were not the only ones this had happened to on our days of travel and several peoples planes had left them as they decided to take off early without warning.
Albany to Chicago. This plane is clean and attendants pleasant. But Im upset with the fact I couldnt pick a seat and I am assigned the last seat 18 that does recline. I have a health issues where I would have never chosen this seat. This plane is small and cramped. For where Im destined I could have picked my usual airline but was suggested by the IT company that is flying me out to pick this one or another airline. I am sadly disappointed. If I can avoid this airline in the future I will. Seat comfort is zero. The lower part of the back indents in so I am hunched forward in this seat that cant recline.
It was my 1st time to fly Akasa Air and was quite sceptical about it since I had read so many negative reviews about the airline. But the experience I got even before boarding the airline till I landed was exceptionally good. Customer helpline operators were really polite well behaved and really helpful. Flight was on time no hassle there. The staff were really good. The aircraft a Boeing 747 was really clean and the inside of it was really colorful and pleasant to look at. The seats were also comfortable with ample leg space for a tall guy like me. The cabin crew members were also very helpful and didnt make a fuss about anything. So overall the whole experience was positive and made me a happy and a satisfied person. I have absolutely no doubt to fly Akasa Boeing again and I would definitely recommend this airline to everybody. Thanks Akasa for a wonderful experience I didnt order any food or beverages and never used the wifi so wouldnt be giving any rating for that.
Auckland to Cape Town via Doha. Just wanted to the ground crew at Auckland Airport for their fabulous service today helping to get my sisterinlaw checked in and upgraded with my Qmiles she was absolutely delighted thank you. We have flown to Europe and back twice with Qatar Airways now in recent years Business Class and they are very much our airline of choice and the most comfortable way to travel what is one of the longest routes in the commercial aviation world.
Rome to Newark booked as a Norwegian flight but be wary of flights like this that area operated by Privilege style. I have never been more disappointed by an overseas long haul flight. The name itself is terrible but paying almost 650 to fly one way made me angry. This aircraft is from 1990 there is no on flight entertainment that works 2 channels did but the headphone jack didnt there is no complimentary water the staff on these flights are like robots. The seat pocket was falling apart and culd barely hold the magazines. If I had known it was going to be like this I would have opted for a better airline.
First they separated me and my family 4. My 9 year old daughter sitting in another row between two strangers. When I asked if they can do anything to stay together the crew said no because she is old enough to be on her own. I didnt want to have to disclose the fact that she is special needs because I thought they would accommodate but they couldnt have cared less. I had to check in my carry on luggage because of no room in the overhead bin. Upon boarding the plane I saw that the overhead bins had personal items in them and poorly placed luggage consuming the most space horizontally. The crew did nothing to accommodate my travels or others. Very disappointed.
Tambolaka to Denpasar. They are never on time. Which is normal when you dont pay the price however there is no information. Two hour delay and there is no representative to explain us the situation. So we are late and not sure how long more we will be. Horrible customer service.
Rome to Thira. Be aware an additional 50euros per person is charged if you have not included your middle name on the booking. There were at least 50 people we saw for our flight alone having to change their ticket to include their middle name at a cost of 50euros. Not to mention having to queue 3 times to then check in. An appalling start to our honeymoon and clearly the website is designed to catch out as many people as possible. When we spoke to the supervisor he admitted this happens all the time Please include your middle name names when booking in the box that asks for first name Or even better choose a different airline
Roma to Olbia. I hesitated about flying to Olbia the ferry being another option given the poor reviews for Meridiana the only company that operates a direct flight from Rome to Olbia. In the end I decided to take the plunge on the basis that perhaps people with good experiences rarely bother to give feedback. And I am glad I did. The online booking was straightforward as was the webcheckin bagdrop etc. Ground staff and cabin staff were pleasant and efficient the plane boarded and left on time and we arrived ontime maybe even a few minutes earlier.
Flew Edinburgh to San Francisco via Heathrow on British Airways A380 Premium Economy and the experience was very good. Short connecting flight from Edinburgh which due to being domestic you are treated as Business Class so get lounge access priority boarding for domestic legs which was nice. A380 Premium Economy seat 62k at the window was excellent. Seat very comfortable loads of space and great storage with bins at the side. Newspapers warm towels and bubbles before takeoff. Inflight entertainment was good food good and well presented. Food and drinks kept coming on the outbound flight. Return night flight a different experience. Same seats but staff were hardly seen due to a lot of people sleeping but there were a lot of people asking for drinks snacks etc and the service just seemed to lack a bit. No bubbles on the way back. Overall a great experience very impressed with BA and the A380 Premium Economy highly recommended and well worth the extra.
New York to Venice via London. Staff have been nice when around but aircraft food assistance and information all deplorable. Booked Business class. First flight overnight from JFK to Heathrow quick mediocre food service then gone. Chair is set up so Im staring at a stranger its uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions. Didnt wake me for breakfast not sure why they had me fill in a form for when I wanted to be woken up. No instructions for the transition between BA flights. Now Im on the flight from Heathrow to Venice no offer of coffee water but worse business class is just coach class no extra leg room just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out. Person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest. I didnt pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flights. I wont fly BA again.
Melbourne to Denpasar. I have travelled for the better half of 15 years around the world and this is by far the worst airline I have dealt with. Pathetic excuse of a company. I will never fly Jetstar again
Stansted to Singapore via Dubai. The flight was long and arduous due to flooding at Dubai airport. This was obviously out of Emirates control. However the lost my bag and as I was travelling on official business I was forced to purchase a replacement suit and medication. I first rang the emirates number in Singapore and spoke to an individual who told me they would email about the case. No email arrived. A week later I was passing through the airport again and went to the Emirates desk. The member of staff was incredibly rude and informed me it was nothing she could help with in fact she just sat shaking her head for most of the conversation. I then rang the Singapore number again and the member of staff informed me I would have to complain. I explained that I did not want to complain but was just looking to have a normal conversation with a member of staff. The cost of the replacement clothes was modest. Anyway I then used the feedback form online to send my request and received nothing back after 3 days. Emirates do not provide an email address. My next step was to speak with someone on online chat function who informed me it could take up to 30 days to respond to my complaint. I expressed incredulity at this number. My only conclusion is that Emirates does not do customer service unless that is you want to buy a business class ticket. It has been a very frustrating and sorry affair. The lack of clear information mixed messages is very frustrating. Individual members of staff seem to have no authority to deal with a problem which speaks to a dysfunctional and frustrating work environment.
The worst company that I ever used. Food is not that you expect. Rude staff. You cant take your hand luggage to board and have to check in your luggage after that you have to spend time to receive it and hope that you receive it back. The worst experience that I ever had.
Horrible customer service. I called in advance to check COVID19 prerequirement for traveling all provided information were wrong so I couldnt fly. Tried to reschedule a flight they made me to open a feedback case. Finally after speaking with 4 agents they accepted me to pay no show fee and reschedule flight. After 7 days I got answer to my feedback of course no errors on their side but they didnt have even my name correct. The good thing is that plane between Toronto and Istanbul was almost empty so i could sleep.
Sofia to Tel Aviv. I havent experienced such a poor customer service so far. During the security screening process I received completely unprofessional treatment this person was asking me questions and after each question was leaving me alone and was going to consult his supervisor for further steps. Therefore the procedure was very long and humiliating. I was travelling with 4 friends for holidays from Sofia to Israel on 2nd of November 2018 Friday with a flight LY0552 at 1155. After the admission interviews we have checkedin together therefore the company representative who attended us checked my luggage under the name of one of my friends by mistake. So basically my luggage was registered under the name of Nikoleta Boerikova. Prior the boarding the security informed my friend Nikoleta that they have removed few items from her bag for further checks and they were going to send her the stuff in a separate box once we would arrive on the airport in Israel . We have arrived on the Ben Gurion Airport around 1420 and we didnt receive any box with the missing items. Nikoleta claimed the missing box thinking that this was part of her luggageAttached the number of the report filled on the airport . After we have left the airport and went to the hotel. As soon as I arrived in the hotel I have noticed that all my cosmetics perfume Bulgari and black swimming suit were missing from my luggage and immediately realized that the removed items were from my luggage not from Nikoletas one. Respectively we have noticed that on my luggage there was a sticker with the name of Nikoleta Boerikova and on her briefcase there was my name instead. During my vacations I had no cosmetics and no swimming suit because they have removed the most important things for a traveling person on vacations and on top of everything you have registered my luggage under the name of another person. I have claimed the missing items 1 week ago and still pending at least an answer I am extremely disappointed This is unacceptable service.
6 May 2014 Las Vegas to Gatwick. Boeing 777. Back on BA again thanks to Avios Companion coupon. Cabin crew are now more present throughout the journey but not experienced any of them going too far to please a customer it seems just okay if they run out of a meal choice or if friends not seated together. Certainly yesterday cleaning the wc was not on the duty list. Ive flown AF TAP SWISS KLM long haul in the past year and by far BA catering in economy is the poorest in content. Yesterdays offering for Breakfast was almost an insult.
Milan Bergamo to Tirana. How are these robbers allowed to operate I was charged a total of Euro 330 at check in just to insert middle names to return tickets for 3 persons. Since when is a middle name legally mandatory What about people with many middle names They might as well have a policy of charging for the way you walk and talk. Sure why not Call it company policy and happy days.
I flew this airline from JFK to Moscow and the flight was terrible. We got the same food for breakfast lunch and dinner and it was meat with rice that was 2 out of the 3 times cold. The flight stewardess barely knew English and the bathroom was filthy but again it was the cheapest option.
Melbourne to Sydney. Money hungry. I was on time for my flight but the customer service insisted that I missed the check in time so that I pay for the next service. Then I found that the flight was already delayed 20 minutes and they could have checked me in. Jetstar never did this.
Worst customer service. Will never use again. Not willing to be there for their customers. I was on time but in a long line with a lot of people by the time we got to the ticket counter we were told our flight is closed for check in. They send us to their customer service across from the ticket counter which had another huge line. At customer service we were told sorry you will have to pay additional 260 to re book next flight 4 hours later and saying we should of came 23 hours before the flight. I asked how come you are charging us since we paid for that ticket. They said if i came 10 min ago they would. We paid and re booked. Even their customer service said same on the phone as in person we are late and should come earlier.
Newark to San Francisco. I am trying to return home on eve of a major storm. I usually fly UA but not satisfied with their service including 1st class so I thought give Virgin America a try. I am on a paid 1st Cl ticket and flight out ok. Food very good seat not lie flat but fine for length of flight. One complaint no lounge in SFO. I am at the moment trying to make a change to an earlier flight to avoid getting stuck by cancellation. The online link to modify it in is dead and have been on hold for 45. The press one for call back option is also dead. I realize it is a mess for them with merger as well as storm warning in progress but one reason I fly 1st is for better service in this kind of service. And BTW no lounge in NY airports
Toronto to Karachi via Istanbul. The flight overall was very good. The flights were on time the staff was friendly and maintained the cleanliness of the toilets. The food was very good. The only negative which i have noticed was that they maintained a general temperature in the plane and the passengers did not have individual airconditioning ducts on the top of their seats so for those passengers who needs extra air or cold temperatures it may be a bit challenging.
THRDXB. Airbus 300600 flying regularly and without delay airport services good with nice hospitality. Onboard cabin was clean good quality food beverages and hospitality professionals in the service of passengers. Airplane toilets were clean and tidy. No inflight entertainment which was frustrating and boring.
SYDNOU Business Class. Nice roomy A330 very clean and well maintained. Friendly crew nice champagne and wines but food not up to much. Pleasant relaxing and uneventful flight.
Aircraft clean with immaculately presented and polite cabin attendants. Seat comfortable with great leg room. Flights on time. Inflight entertainment consisted of North Korean military type music. Food was a cold burger with a choice of water coffee tea or soft drink.
Myself my mother and my husband flew Gatwick to Sydney via Taipei with China Airlines but will never fly with them again. The cabin crew on the first leg of the journey did not speak hardly at all. We could not hear nor understand the announcements so in an emergency it would have been guess work which I find astounding but in general I think its poor customer service. The food was just awful I know it was 95 Chinese passengers but I think the airline should look at the list of people and cater for those who dont want to eat soggy rice and chicken on both the inbound and outbound flights. The blankets provided were a dirty mustard colour and were way past their use date. The cabin crew all were wearing face masks to protect themselves and passengers but found it totally unhygienic that they wiped down the toilet floors units and toilet with paper towels and no gloves on that to me was not only disgusting but a health and safety issue. Overall we all found our experience with China Airlines a very poor one. Never again to be repeated.
Previously Ive always flown Kenya Airways on this route with the total journey time being around 15.5 hours. For this trip I decided to give RwandAir a try due of their quicker overall journey times of approx. 2.5 hours less than KA. However the experience was very disappointing. The lie flat business class seats on the LHRKGL leg are superb and allow a great nights sleep. The cabin staff are friendly and helpful but unfortunately thats where the good ends. On 2 of the 4 four flights involved in this return trip a Gin and Tonic could not be served due to having run out of tonic on one leg the business class toilet light would not come on when the door was closed leaving it so dark I couldnt see the toilet flush button until Id opened the door again on another the toilet ran out of hand drying towels which were not replaced for 2 hours there are no printed meal menus the cabin crew have the offerings hand written in an exercise book where they record each passengers choice. Worst of all was the appalling quality of the food. To show how bad the food is I offer this photo of an Egg Florentine for breakfast just look at that egg yolk By the time of the third flight Id given up on eating on the plane opting to eat in the lounge before departure. So much lacking and all at a cost of several 100 more than a KA business class return on the same travel dates.
On time capable staff typical fare for a low budget airline. As good as can be expected when flying on a low budget airline.
San Francisco to Tokyo via Seoul. The flight from Seoul to Tokyo Haneda delayed 3 times so far. The airline failed to inform passengers as soon as they knew about a delay. The first delay I found out at the boarding gate near the scheduled boarding time 3 hour delay. The second delay was known 30 minutes after the boarding time after we pressed an airline employee to find out while he appeared to be running away another 3 hour delay. The third delay is announced at the boarding time unknown how long until further notice. To their credit they gave out bottled water once during this long frustrating process. But nothing else no explanation no other accommodation. Some local passengers were yelling many lied around trying to get some sleep. Inquiries made in English were met with very limited response. We were not given a chance to plan for alternatives with the late announcements or lack of transparency. We are still waiting.
Denpasar to Amsterdam via Medan. Deeply disappointed. Old 5.9 years wornout A330200 seats colored with a shade of brown. Squeaky and many monitors dont work. Which does not matter since they have like 5 okayish movies on their flights and the rest was trash for me. We had 2.5 weeks between our flights and there were no new movies in this time. The food was unpalatable for me. Indonesian food is ok but not to my liking. You have to call the airline and wait 30 minutes to order special meals. They ran out of wine and snacks halfway the flight. Crew barely speaks English to me. Trying to upgrade to business was a joke. We experienced a lot of frustration on this flight.
The flight in which i travelled from Dubai to Amsterdam turned out to be the worst experience by Emirates. Water was dripping from the roof and the crew took it very lightly. They were responding that we have informed to our manager but no actions were taken about it till i landed in Amsterdam. I literally had to hold and sit with the plastic cover they had given as the blanket cover for most of the distance.
I fly regularly both international domestic. I booked a quick inter island flight from Kauai to Oahu where I live. For internet island travel the boarding pass says to check in 30 minutes before. My flight was at 745 so I was dropped off in front of the Hawaiian Airlines checkin at the Lihue airport at 715. I wasnt checking a bag so literally just needed to complete the 30 second check in on the kiosk. The kiosks to check in were closed. When I went up to the counter the lights were off the two agents were walking around the counter. They said the counter closes at 715 no one was here. You cant check in now. I said its literally 716 right now I was here trying fo check in but your kiosks are closed. The agent speaking to me was very rude saying well we closed at 715 you were supposed to check in 30 minutes before your flight. which is what I was doing. When I asked what I could do she shrugged saying we are closed come back tomorrow. I have never seen an airline close all its windows before the last flights leave and they should definitely put this on your boarding information and say 45 minutes or 60 minutes since they dont disclose that they close beforehand. I had to pay for a ticket the next day I think its completely unacceptable that this airline closed before their last flights take off and they were definitely closed before the 30 minute window and were not helpful to reschedule me. I will be using Mokulele from now on for any of my flights since theres no aloha from this company.
My trip from Manila to Tagbilaran was moved by 2 hours and 50 minutes got a 3 day notice from Zest Air 3 hours of wasted time and they refused to rebook me for free. Same thing happened to my return flight Tagbilaran to Manila. This time there was no notice that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hrs.
Unfortunately I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled happens often Economics reasons very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me even though it was open. And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because Im not a Silver Member Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad.
Dublin to Singapore via CDG return with Air France. Great service on the business class leg from Dublin to Paris. The La Premiere first class leg from Paris CDG to Singapore was impeccable. Greeted as I left the plane in CDG and taken by limousine to the First class lounge. The hostess was very attentive and friendly. Great food and quiet place to wait for the flight. Taken by limousine again to board the first class cabin. Service on board top notch. The stewardess could anticipate what I needed and I never needed to ask for anything. Excellent seat and a curtain to give more privacy if needed. Greeted on arrival in Singapore my luggage was already waiting when I cleared immigration. Return flight equally top class. Access into the exclusive Jetquay lounge in the CIP terminal in Changi Airport. All details taken care off and able to clear immigration at this terminal before taken on a buggy to board the plane. Again service on board was perfect. Only small things need some improvement. Service on the ground in Dublin was nowhere near the La Premiere experience in CDG and Changi. Lounge in Dublin quite poor. Not even greeted with eye contact when I got into the lounge in Dublin. Poor choice of food. On the return leg it took nearly an hour for my luggage to be delivered in Dublin. The jetquay lounge in Changi was impressive but the food selection not that great. In summary La Premiere with Air France is the best first class experience I have ever had. Air France is certainly able to deliver a truly amazing First class experience. If I wanted to be critical the only thing I can say is the menu could include local Singaporean dishes such as satay and nasi lemak. WiFi was available on the CDG to Singapore leg but not on the return flight.
Vancouver to Taipei. I have flown EVA Airways several times over the last few years between Vancouver and Thailand via Taipei. EVA is by far the very best airline in providing courtesy respect communication excellent food and comfort. On this past trip I needed assistance being able to connect to the onboard WiFi. One of the flight attendants was extremely helpful in making sure that I could connect and she was great. She might have been the lead flight attendant. The food is incredible and served with class. The flights leave on time or even a bit early once everyone is onboard and they seem to arrive on time or very close to on time. The washrooms are immaculate. I have recommended EVA Airways to friends who have also taken the route from Vancouver to Thailand and come away with praise for this excellent airline I have also taken the route from Toronto to Thailand and that fight and service is superb also
After this latest experience I will be avoiding KLM. When I checked in online on September 10th for KL678 from Calgary to Amsterdam I was offered and I accepted and paid for an upgrade from Comfort to Business Class at a cost of 1134.28 Cdn. When I checked in at the KLM counter the next day I was told I was bumped from BC to accommodate a crew member who was returning to Amsterdam. Even though I was civil and courteous I was moved to row 43 at the back of the airplane because my Economy Comfort seat was not available. When I asked for a refund at the counter the agent said I had to do that online and it would not be a problem. She wrote down the KLM refund website link. After I returned from my 3 week trip I submitted to KLM the refund request. One month later I received a one sentence email declining my request without reasons. I appealed the decision and no response from KLM 4 months later. I have since learned from various customer feedback sites that KLM has done this to 100s of passengers.
This was the worst airline I had ever been on in my entire life and Im a frequent traveler. First we drank our waters before going through security and purchased new water to take on the plane. Our boarding passes were scanned and just as we were about to walk on the plane we noticed the flight attendants were searching everyones bags. They were looking for water. They confiscated it Then on the plane they would not give you any water for free. The flight attendant laughed at me when I asked for a small cup of water. He said I had to buy it for 3.00 but heres the thing credit card only and not one of my 4 US credit cards would work. 6 hour flight with no water. Awful. Seats were terrible. My whole row wouldnt recline so you could imagine the space I had when the person in front of me did recline. No on flight entertainment on any of the 8 Avianca flights we took while visiting the Galapagos. They said they were giving us free wifi which didnt work on any flight. Our travel agent booked us meals which we never got. Half the crew didnt speak English and the ones that did spoke broken English that was difficult to understand. The staff seemed very rude to non Spanish speaking guests. Beverage carts went up and down the aisle once during the 6 hour flight one cart from the rear and one from the front. It took the cart 2 hours to cover half the plane because no ones credit card would work on their machine. Everyone was attempting multiple credit cards. This airline is a joke I would NEVER recommend them and I would urge all fellow travelers to go out of their way to avoid this airline at all costs.
Supposed to return to DFW on July 1 2021. They told us it was delayed. No problem. We get there the SY staff informs us its cancelled and if we need a hotel. We declined and asked our next steps they told us to just go home and wait for an email and said they were unable to book flights mildly frustrating. I understand flights get cancelled but the staff essentially told us to just go home and wait for someone to reach out to us which still hasnt happened in over 14 hours. Been on hold with SY for over an hour put my number into the call back list over 8 hours ago and havent received any call back extremely frustrating. We receive an email saying well get a voucher for a new flight within 10 business days absolutely unacceptable. A couple of extra days Sure maybe. 10 business days stranded is just plain wrong. No other phone number works so I went back to the airport to get some additional information. All of the staff left. No SY agent anywhere in the airport. As of right now we are stuck at our current destination with no idea of when we can return to DFW as we havent heard anything and cannot get a hold of anyone to help us with our issue. The unprofessionalism lack of efficiency lack of response and lack of resources to aid customers is disappointing. I can say with confidence I will never fly with this airline again. Ive had other flights cancelled with American and other airlines and they handled it with haste and professionalism I have seen neither here.
I purchased a roundtrip ticket on the 28th going up and the 29th coming back from Chennai to Hyderabad. I did my web checkin while on the alliance website. I couldnt download the web checkin receipt or get an email. I called customer service and the woman on the phone told me right away that there is a problem with the website and I cant get the receipt via email or on my phone. I called her and voiced my displeasure but she could not give a proper answer. Is this how the clients are handled
This was a great experience from San Francisco to Singapore. The seat was very comfortable and had a generous 8 inches of recline. There was also a nice reading light next to the seat. The TV screen was huge and itwas really responsive. There was also a nice footrest. If you choose a window seat from rows 4044 you get a huge compartment for storage. This was SQ33 and had only business and premium economy seats. An hour after take off the first meal was served and I chose the Korean beef short rib. This was really good. I used the online Book the Cook to choose the meal which was a great service. The menu also included an amenity kit with some really soft eye mask a toothbrush a comb and some socks on request. In the back at the galley there was a self serve snack bar. Also there are 2 free checked bags with SQ premium economy. They served some snacks in the middle of the flight for those who were still awake and I got an apple. They also handed out water bottles in the beginning of the flight which was very generous. Then in the morning I got breakfast some noodles and pork and that was really good. The selection for the TV was really nice too and it included a ton of Marvel including endgame.
Maputo to Perth via Johannesburg. Two great flights. MaputoJohannesburg The A320 is a brand aircraft with the new cabin. The seat is a comfortable leather similar to the ones on the A330300. The crew were really friendly. We had a delay leaving Maputo because our engines wouldnt start due to a faulty APU. The captain and first officer were very nice and told us the situation. JohannesburgPerth The A340300 was showing its age. I believe our plane was made in 2003. The economy seats were a bit old but comfortable. There was lots of legroom for the 8hr flight. The food was great and the service was amazing. The entertainment system was quite old but had up to date movies so you wouldnt get bored. The two things I found a let down. The arm rest wouldnt go all the way up due to the remote for the IFE situated there. Also how you couldnt store any baggage during takeoff or landing if you are seated in the aisle. But all in all a great flight.
Prague to Dubrovnik. One of the worst flight experiences ever. Despite booking with Czech Airlines we were put on this code share with Smartwings out of Prague. We had extra bags and made plans in advance to handle those. I have Delta Gold Medallion but they would not honor that status for allowing an extra bag. We were charged 260 for excess baggage for a flight where both tickets were less than that amount. They would not honor Czech Airlines baggage conditions. The flight was less than onequarter full and I can see why based on the level of customer service. Be sure any flights with Czech Airlines dont use this carrier.
Birmingham to Colombo via Dubai with Emirates. Poor throughout specially onboard food and service which is what I thought Emirates was renowned for and worth paying extra for. Birmingham to Dubai we had the A380 which was very comfortable with seats that I could sit crosslegged on. The entertaintment system was also amazing. This is where the positives end as the boarding of this flight took so long that there was an hour delay to take off. The organisation for transfers was poor to nonexistent with a massive queue for security at Dubai with minimal time for the connection. For the rest of our flights Dubai to Sri Lanka Sri Lanka to Dubai with a stop at Male and Dubai to Birmingham we had the smaller and older aircraft B777300. This was noticably older dated and uncomfortably cramped. The entertainment screens poor quality in comparison. The worst of all was the inflight service. Pressed my buzzer for help with a nonfunctioning screen and an hour later nobody had come to ask what I needed. In the end I had to keep pressing the buzzer continuously about 15 times before someone came to us. I had no entertainment for the duration of 2.5 hours. It only took 5 minutes to fix when they actually got round to it. The food and beverage service also poor. They had a choice of fish or chicken but by the time they got to aisle 23 they had completely run out of chicken. I offered to wait till the end of service to see if any was left. I was told categorically there was none left and then later I saw them handing chicken to some passengers. On the 8hour flight from Dubai to Birmingham after an hour on the plane before take off and an hour on the bus waiting to board the plane apart from the little tub of water with the snack and breakfast no drinks runs to even offer people water. On walking around I saw all the service staff at the back of the plane with tea and biscuits having a good old jolly. Overall a very disappointing experience completely unexpected from an airline with the reputation of Emirates.
San Francisco to Singapore via Hong Kong. Beautiful seats with such comfort. Sufficient storage space. If you long for Singapore cuisine there is tons on board. Whilst I did not eat the crew reserved a banana for me before we landed. The SFOHKG was uneventful as the crew were kind switched off the lights early allowing us to sleep. The HKGSIN sector departed on time and the HKG ground crew and lounge staff were very courteous attending to any questions I had about my allergies. The crew was quick to get us our drinks and meals and then we settled to do our work or watch a movie. My suggestion is that if the crew is aware that on board wifi is not available for the initial part of the HKGSIN as apparently the networks are not that great. This will be very helpful.
Check in in Riga was fast friendly. Although noisy ATR is not my favourite aircraft this flight was still ok. The legroom was decent and you have a nice view if seated by window. Two FAs were super friendly with smiles. One of them spoke Swedish too which is quite rare nowadays. The approach was a little bumpy but such things happen. Arrival on time.
Berlin to Keflavik. Good value flight with on time departure. Basic services yet comfortable seats. Did not purchase food on board since I got my own from SXF. No entertainment system Flight attendants are dry and should try to be more friendly
Flew from Ankara to Heathrow via Baku. 1st leg business 2nd leg economy. At Baku the checkin clerk asked us for extra money for him or else he would not be able to seat us together as the plane was full. We declined and were given seats nowhere near each other. However the plane was at least half empty including the seat next to my husband and 2 seats next to me His actions did not reflect well on the airline which was otherwise very good. Staff on board very good but terminal staff not so. Have tried to complain to airline but keep getting sent round in circles.
Makassar to Jakarta in 2018. Great airline clean cabin. The flight attendant are nice. But the checkin queue is very long took a lot of time. The food taste good. Long wait for baggage.
Bangkok to Hong Kong. The flight attendants were the worst I have experienced in Business Class. I felt they were so unhappy about the job and about to walk out of the position. On the other flight from Hong Kong to Bangkok in Economy the flight is half full still the service is way below. The seat is old I can felt the iron under my ass. I remembered Emirates used to be really good years ago.
Manchester to Shanghai via Beijing. Hainan Airlines is a very good airline and it provided me quite valuable fly experience. When I travel to Shanghai via Beijing due to some terms and conditions I had to leave my whisky at the airport. And at this time one of Hainan airlines crew helped me to sent my items to my home via express. She did me such a big favor without asking any payment or reward.
Check in online was a breeze in regards to the carry on bags nobody at the boarding gate complained about the size or weight. Boarding and deplaning was done by rows and did not take long. Due to the pandemic there was no onboard service on either flight. Flights were on time and seats were comfy. On both planes there were ports to charge your phone and the cabins looked pretty new. There was also LATAM play onboard in which you can watch movies on your own device.
Two flights on Lan Peru as part of One World Alliance RTW Business trip. Quito to Lima one class plane but as we are sapphire members of One World could access Quito Executive Club and was escorted to plane at the other end our luggage was taken off and waiting for us as it was priority this also happened on our long haul flight Lima to LAX we were most impressed with this service. The other good thing was at Lima airport we had to book in 7 hours ahead of flight1am and was allowed to book in and go to the lounge. The long haul with beds was really good except for the fact a couple of passengers decided to leave their luggage out of the overhead lockers this was allowed by the staff who seemed too intent on socialising to check on this. The seats belts were not checked in our cabin on take off or landing which is most surprising. But all in all still very good flights.
San Diego return business class the seat was more comfortable than the first class one. As usual plane was fine service was OK but not attentive i.e just about OK. Food was terrible I have flown BA in economy business and first and never had good or adequate quality food. If they upped their game on this they would be unbeatable. Entertainment pretty dire at least first had a few good box sets of TV programmes. My wife was back in economy her comment was that the world traveller plus seat gave her backache the economy seat was better. Her food was inedible.
Bridgetown to Gatwick. I couldnt imagine that first class on BA would be the same as travelling in business class with for example Qatar Emirates Etihad Singapore Thai etc for double the price. Cabin seats and food equals business class. One of the red wines on the wine list was out from start when I left London outbound. Cabin crew worked well and gave splendid service. But first class on BA is not worth the fare. When I complained to customer service after I got home all I got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller.
This an addendum to my previous review of PAL Flight 101 Honolulu to Manila departing HNL 20 May 2023 arriving MNL 21 May 2023. My biggest issue the our missing baggage of which I am pleased to report that our remaining luggage was just delivered today 23 May 2023 at approximately 1230pm Manila time to our hotel in Eastwood City Quezon City Philippines. All three pieces were delivered intact by the courier contracted by Philippine Airline. I wish to thank PAL for their hard efforts in retrieving our missing luggage. I am pleased with PALs efforts and with their ground and cabin service I am happy to say I will fly them again.
Istanbul to Zurich. Lounge and fast track access at IST convenient and at a high standard. Ground services provider TGS also on good behavior. On time boarding with priority implemented for families and statusbusiness Pax. Warm greeting by crew and informative announcement from the flight deck in good English. Proper 2x2 business class seats with on demand IFE and a wide range of content. The 3course onboard catering very good as usual. Cabin crew could be a little more proactive with refills. Landed ahead of schedule at ZRH. Turkish Airlines is providing a very competitive product and premium product compared to other European Carriers.
Avoid especially if booking United Airlines and they code share. My UA app shows my bags being scanned at 11.35 am. My Air Dolomiti flight was delayed boarding so there was plenty of time to move mine and my girlfriends bag for our flight to Florence. They didnt make it. There was another later flight that arrived about 7.30 pm. Then the next day as well. It is 7.10 pm 27 hours later and still no bags. My hotel is 1 hr away. The paper the airport lost and found gave me only has an automated system that says Your bags have been found. Found where The guy I spoke to twice today was nice and somewhat helpful and said my 2 bags were picked up by a courier mid morning. Why not at 8 am when the office opens I ask because after calling United Airlines they told me our bags came in on last nights flight.
Melbourne to Jakarta via Singapore. We arrived at Melbourne Airport 1 hour early not expecting the checkin to be open the checkin counter was open and had no line. I requested a window seat and was lucky to get one in the front cabin we were also told our flight might be full. We boarded the A380 with nice welcoming smile. Our seat had a blanket pillow IFE coat hook and USB we took off on time and once we were in the air we were handed out the amenities kit which included socks eyemask and toothbrush. Food service started and the options were Turkey or Chicken sandwich the man next to me did not want to eat but the crew insisted I chose the Turkey sandwich and it was amazing my drink choice was coke then I fell asleep. I woke up just in time for breakfast and the options were rice vermicelli or omelette. I chose the rice vermicelli which was OK I had orange juice for my drink. We had a smooth landing in Singapore Changi T2 and had 30 minutes before boarding the flight to Jakarta. We just made our flight and I was given a window seat I asked for a glass of water because I had run across the terminal and staff happily said yes and gave it to me with an ice cube great start. We took off on time and the lunch service started straight away I chose Nasi Goreng instead of omelette the fried rice was the best plane food I had ever eaten I had apple juice as my drink. Excellent customer service.
My family and I had a flight from Cebu to Dallas via Seoul on March 4 2020 but due to the Corona Virus we had to cancel. The customer service rep said they were going to charge us 300 USD for cancelling. I need more clarification about the refund process but I cant seem to connect to their US hotline. Sad. I love Korean Air. I always have a good experience with them but this really disappoints me.
China Airlines has the worst customer service and support. We booked a round trip from Singapore to Vancouver last week. Our flight got cancelled due to a typhoon in Taipei and we got to know of it just a day before we were suppose to fly. There was no way to reach out to the airlines no helpline 247. It was a struggle to contact the airline and we wrote on their Facebook page on which they responded. They asked to wait and asked to visit the airport next day morning. Got there early morning and they blatantly said they cant do anything Flight is cancelled and no replacement to fly. We were told there is one flight which was on very short notice and we coudnt have possibly taken it With no way out we booked another flight to do our trip paying a lot more extra. We reached Vancouver and were continuously getting messages from China Airlines for our return flight which made us comfortable that our outgoing flight is on To our horror we were stopped from boarding the flight And then came in the China Airlines supervisor who broke some news to us which none bothered to convey till then by the airlines. First he said if you board the flight you cant get refund for the incoming flight which we technically did use. Yes we couldnt use because you cancelled the flight and did not give any backup flight to the helpless customer. None of the customer service people at the airport told us about the refund and cancellation in such scenarios. Zero communication. The supervisor blatantly asked to decide whether to board and forget the refund for one way or buy another ticket and take a full refund. We were aghast. This isnt just a monetary situation but a big mental pressure for someone travelling with family. The airline showed no sympathy towards the child too. To convey the same we went to one of the representatives and they kinda looked lost had no idea and then directed us to someone else laughing at out back. This is ridiculous and shows the airline lacks basic human courtesy A little later the supervisor came and said That we cant board the flight altogether Since the ticket stands null and void None from the airlines conveyed us till now and instead we were getting all flight updates on messages. Is it a technical problem that your system shows customer wrong information and you the right information We coudnt sleep looking for another pocket friendly Flight to go Home and hotel to stay. Whos to be blamed We may forget the financial loss but the mental agony China Airlines has caused is beyond words.
On Sunday 131122 I was going back from Iloilo to Manila and had a connection with Emirates. Between 2 and 3 am I got an email that my flight is delayed by like 4 hours. Of course I was only aware of this around 8 am when I woke up. So needed to rebook the Emirates flights which I barely managed to do because of time concerns and cost me an extra 260 pounds. Also what if I cant rebook it how do I get home When I asked for some kind of compensation they answered since I didnt have an insurance I am not eligible for one. All I got was a little rice with McDonalds chicken and some water. If this was not enough after we boarded they made us wait another hour inside the plane so the originally 1315 flight took off around 1750. The first 25 mins they announced but the rest was not communicated at all. This was my first and last travel with the company. I am disappointed and cant recommend at all
I was flying from Manchester to Hanoi with just a 55 minute connection in Doha so when they announced there was going to be a 2 hour delay taking off from Manchester I realised I would miss my onward flight. Other passengers were not happy to the point that 2 coppers arrived and led a passenger away just a quiet word did the trick. In the end it was nearly 3 hours late taking off although at least 1 passenger decided not to fly which I think added to the delay as they had to offload her bags. Once in the air I was pleased I had chosen Qatar Airways as without doubt their economy seat is the most comfortable I have ever travelled in. I think some airlines have the 777EW as 353 where as Qatar have gone with 343 so are less narrow plus these seats also have good lumbar support. Less impressive were the food offerings I had opted for a vegetarian dish which was very spicy but the FA on seeing that I had not really touched my main was quick to offer an alternative. I hadnt actually said a word of complaint which amazed me as my usual experience with FAs when travelling economy is that they barely register you exist. On arriving in Doha at around 4am I was pleasantly surprised how efficient Qatars ground staff were as they had already booked me a hotel room and issued a new boarding pass. Had to go through immigration which was painless then off to Movenpick Towers and Suites with a 250 Rials credit about 50 to be used for food. I also had my suitcase sent to the hotel which arrived within 2 hours. This was enough for 2 good meals using room service but was told I could not use the restaurant. Qatar passengers are banned from using the restaurant on Fridays. Also slightly annoying was that the hotel gave the 250 credit in 3 vouchers 1007575 so if I wanted to place a food order for 110 I was told I would have to use 2x75 and not receive a voucher for unused 40 Rials. Anyhow bus picked me up at midnight took me back to airport and checked in for my Hanoi flight. Think it was a different aircraft as economy was 3x3x3 but seats looked identical and just as comfortable. Flight seemed to go quickly including around 60 minutes stop in BKK. Food offerings were even worse than the ManchesterDoha leg but wasnt too bothered as wasnt really hungry anyhow. Hanoi arrival was very smooth into what looks like a brand new terminal. At the price I paid for my ticket I will definitely fly with Qatar again and if flying from Manchester eat at the pub on the perimeter road before checking in.
Pleasant flight on both Kuala Lumpur to Doha and Doha to London Heathrow with Qatar Airways. Crew were very professional and service impeccable onboard. Good option to fly with a transit at Doha.
Dragonair really is an OK airline. I flew them for the umpteenth time to Kaohsiung and while the unentertained seat was bearable well it was pretty comfortable the flight was really boring as the seatbelt sign stayed on. Service was good and breakfast was phenomenal aside from crunchy siu mai. On the return I wonder if StudioKA trades off good food as the food we had was starchy not too bad but not good. StudioKA is limited without actual movies. Overall pleasant but nothing worth raving about.
Hong Kong to Singapore. Scoot refuses to refund me my money after rescheduling my flight by more than 8 hours. Ive called multiple times but have been put on hold and eventually not getting a reply. Feels like Ive been made a fool. I have also emailed many times and not get a reply. What is happening Is this a strategy to prevent losses How can we get a response and a refund
Baltimore to Pittsburgh. Horrible airline. I checked in online and arrived to the ticket counter on time and no one was there to check my bag. After calling a representative they said to throw out my liquids over 3oz and to go through security. So I did. I get to the gate before boarding. I stand up to board and they said I cant get on the flight because I didnt check in at the ticket counter which was their fault. I asked to talk to someone who could help me get on a flight. They said they cant help and walked into an employees only room. When I called the airline they would only offer me credit for airline which I dont want because I will never fly with them again.
Had many problems with this airline including trying to get in touch with the customer service. Every number email and their existing website either doesnt exist or doesnt respond. First of all I find it appalling that even in economy class that this flight only offers one meal for a 13 hour flight. Also alcoholic beverages arent complimentary and are ridiculously expensive around 10 euros for a small paper cup of wine I decided to drink some of my alcohol that I bought in the dutyfree and ok fair enough this is prohibited but not only have I done this on other airlines in the past but I was given no notification that it was prohibited. A Japanese woman came over and asked me what was in the cup and I simply told her that it was Brandenburg and kindly gave it to her within minutes another of her colleagues came over and grabbed the cup which was empty with just ice in it and he said this is not the alcohol you gave her give me what you have. He proceeded to stick his hand in my bag that was sitting on the seat next to me and took out a bottle of whiskey and took it away. He also told me that this was highly illegal and that the authorities would be contacted when we landed. I spoke to another staff later in the flight and told her that most likely that I wouldnt fly with this airline again in which she told me that we dont care. Even on air India which has been ranked very low at times have I been treated so poorly in my life
Flew back from Milan LIN on Jan 4th. Because of mist the pilots actual characterization most flights that morning had been delayedcanceled inout of LHR. No delay info given at checkin nor at gate. Upon boarding the captain informed us that because of mist we were being held on the ground for 2 hours. My connecting flight to SFO was 2.5 hrs after landing in LHR. Flight attendant assured me most flights were being delayed therefore mine to SFO most likely too. Upon landing in LHR a sea of canceleddelayed lost souls. I was immediately told I was forced to miss my connection because my flight to SFO was on time. I was forced to join the longest line Ive ever seen for rebooking. It never moved. We were told another set of rebooking desks were available upstairs and faster. Crossing the border control took just as long. Upstairs it took me 5 hours just to get closer to the desks but still at least a couple hours away. I finally managed to join the free wifi and call BAs office to get rebooked online. I was rebooked on a flight from SFO to LHR. The wrong way around. When I pointed out the obvious the agent told me there was a computer glitch and promised to call me back. She finally called me back and got rebooked on AA flights to JFK and to SFO from there. The next morning at the AA check in they could not check me in on the JFKSFO because of issues with the BA ticket. It took 90 minutes and multiple interactions with 3 different desks to get it solved. I nearly missed the flight to JFK too. My suitcase was never loaded on that flight and I didnt get it at JFK. It took me 5 days to get my suitcase back. I will never fly British Airways again.
Unprofessional cabin crew. They removed my cabin bag from a locker without informing me about it and staff did not inform other stewards about it. I informed that my bag is missing and Ryanair attendants informed they cant help me and do not know who might took my bag. I was able to locate my bag after involving airport police. A stewardess hit my elbow with a food trolley several times and wasnt bothered to apologise.
Despite the risks and bad feedback my wife and me decided to take the Sunwing trip package to Royalton Cayo Santa Maria. Everything went just fine Checkin at Toronto airport was quick. There were no long lines as we expected. The aircraft WG302 flew out on schedule. We booked seats in advance through the Sunwing website. But there were still empty seats the plane was not full. Great service It was possible to take drinks and various snacks during a 3hour flight. No quibbles about masks. Baggage at the airport was issued quickly no delays. The return flight was also hasslefree. Although the plane was flied 1 hour late from Toronto they stopped less in Santa Clara Airport and cut the gap to 30 minutes when we landed in Toronto. In Pearson Airport we also got our luggage fast at 2 am and passed through all the checkouts. Thanks a lot to the Sunwing team for a great vacation
The flight was quite good the friendliness of the ground and air staff was very good. Quite satisfied with the flight this time. Thank you Top Choice for domestic options. Penerbangan yang cukup baik keramahan Staff darat dan Udara sangat baik. Cukup Puas dengan penerbangan kali ini. Terima kasih. Pilihan Utama untuk pilihan domestik.
Flew flight NH203 which departs at 22.45. Catering on this flight was very poor. No meal service after departure. This is a 14h flight so many passengers are not in a rush to fall asleep and a light dinner option should be offered. All passengers started ordering mid flight snacks even though it was just after take off. This 14h flight only offers one hot meal in Business Class. A breakfast with one Japanese option and two Western options. Of those two western options one is with Seafood Pilaf. The other option is a plate with cheese and lettuce which ANA calls continental breakfast. No warm bread was offered. Very poor catering for a 14h flight. ANA should be offering a brunch style main meal service which would adapt perfectly to the early hours of FRA and lunch time of origin HND. Also ANA offers poor bedding. Given the amount of ultra long haul flights it operates they should offer better bedding. Wifi should be complimentary in Business class
BA operate daily shuttles from London to Glasgow its a busy route and Im sure make money plus there is no competition. However BA flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passengers are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed enroute from some far flung exotic location. Because I have several buses and trains to catch after I reach Glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to BA hence Im very disappointed with the service they provide.
Venice to Gatwick. I use Snokart luggage which is designed to be zipped and fastened together to allow skiers to check in one bag only. In Feb of this year I was told by BA check in staff in Venice that it is against their baggage policy to allow luggage to be fastened together. The staff were clear that it is BA policy that bags cannot be fastened together. For nearly three months I have been asking the BA complaints team to provide evidence of this baggage policy. I have had several replies in that time but on each occasion the customer service staff have failed to provide evidence of the baggage policy alleged by their check in staff in Venice. BA has also refused to confirm whether these two check in staff are in fact BA employees or employed by a third party. This is very disappointing in what was a reputable company.
Kuwait to Delhi. Never fly with Kuwait Airways. No responsibility for connecting flights. They might have better prices but they will compensate with their horrible service. Flights are overbooked so they would off load you and give you the next flight on the next day. And in this process they misplace your luggage and promise to get it delivered to your door steps however eventually charge you for the delivery.
Very disorderly boarding at Warsaw and instead of ensuring a timely and smooth boarding process unfriendly ground staff started measuring and weighing hand luggage just at boarding time. Pieces above 8 kg were forcibly checked into the hold allegedly to save space in the cabin and were not delivered at the aircraft but via baggage reclaim. I certainly wont pay solidly and fly an airline again whose ground staff bully their customers. Cabin crew were fine on both legs friendly and attentive.
European short haul business class can not be compared with international the seating is very different normal standard class seats with a spare seat in the centre. However for this short flight it was adequate. Service onboard was friendly if a little mechanical. Food served was pretty nice with very tender beef with mashed celeriac and a chocolate pudding and delicious bread roll and butter. A wide choice of drinks were offered wine beer soft drinks tea coffee etc. The flight attendant came around several times on this short flight offering further drinks and tidying up. We also received the very tasty Lufthansa branded chocolate.
Gatwick to Las Palmas. The customer experience made Ryanair look like a 5 star airline. Recently tried to fly with TUI to take my partner on holiday and get engaged. Unable to check in online for an unknown reason. Arrived at the airport check in area later than planned due to traffic but on time according to the terms and conditions on the ticket. I was concerned about the length of the queue so sought assistance from a member of staff in Tui branding at the self check in desks explained the situation and she checked flight times etc and told me we had plenty of time and to queue. After queuing I was told they had now closed the flight while we were queuing and we couldnt board. I then had to run around the airport to find another flight. TUIs customer services teams response computer says no issues effectively we cant be bothered to investigate because we dont want to have to compensate you and the airport staff dont work for us so we do my care despite then wearing our branding. We flew with Tui on the return flight so I can review the flight experience which was nothing special.
Moscow Domodedovo to Houston via London Heathrow roundtrip in economy class. All the flights were full in economy with the exception of BA195 which was 23 to 34 full. British Airways flight attendents are cordial and professional. There was a wide range of beverages served including complementary alcoholic beverages. The standard inflight meals were not bad but not great either. The 10hour flight between London and Houston featured a dinner early in the flight and a snack at the end of the flight. The 4hour flight between London and Moscow featured a snack at the beginning of the flight. I was surprised by the leg room in economy. I am not tall but at 180 cm tall 71 inches I was able to extend my legs fully under the seat in front of me. This made these long flights bearable. Both flights offerred headphones blankets and pillows. The cabin temperature on the flights to Houston was cold I had to put on a light jacket. The cabin temperature on the flight from London to Moscow was too warm I was sweating. When people are using the flight safety card to fan themselves you know it is warm. The inflight entertainment screen on the B777 in economy is of poor quality and needs to be upgraded. I could feel the heat being emitted from the screen as well. Make sure that your luggage is below the weight limit heavy bags are an additional 100 USD per bag.
This airline is my number one choice to travel overseas. Turkish airlines is the most organized airline I experienced from customer service to airport facilities to staff and flight attendants all super friendly very helpful
Nok Air cancelled the purchased flight with 48 hours notice and advised by email. Replies to request the same day later flight were ignored. 24 hours later I had to ask someone in Thailand to call Nok Air to rebook for me. Turned up for the later flight as planned with luggage of 42kg as recorded by international carrier. Nok scales weighed it at 45.9kg. I complained so they weighed it on another desk where it was back to 42kg Clearly there is a huge disparity on revenue generating scales Delay was 7 hours so once journey was complete I attempted to claim 1000 baht insurance as covered according to the policy having opted to spend considerably more on a hotel as the delay was added to a 6 hour wait already necessary due to my inbound international flight. Three weeks later and after numerous emails of nonsense from Nok Air I gave up. They can keep the 1000 baht Im flying AirAsia instead more expensive and not known for customer service but better the Nok Air by a country mile. On board Nok are equally as good or bad as AirAsia depending on your expectations but customer service is not a concept Nok Air has mastered to date.
They are ok but they do not impress with anything They usually leave a little later than scheduled and they dont serve anything for free unlike KLM
All I can say is mediocre. Having flown this route with other airlines in business class I believe I have been spoilt. The British Airways product is old and just adequate. TV screen small and poor quality food okay but nothing more seating poor. The one highlight was quality of service from the crew. I had nothing to actually complain about but nothing to make me want to use this product again.
Washington to Stockholm via Paris CDG. I booked a codeshare flight as I am a Delta Airlines Premium member and initially booked premium economy on Air France as I had seen photos of their seats etc. When I checked in I was offered an upgrade to business for a very great rate. Of course I jumped at the chance to fly overnight hours in style. While not as superb as a Delta or American business reclining beds in your own pod the seating was excellent. Roomy nice with ample storage built in so one did not have to get up too often. The service was also lovely and attentive. Food was excellent for airplane facilities. Overall the experience was pleasurable as the aircraft was new. The flight was ontime. The service conscientious. The only minor flaw was the entertainment was not the best but on an overnight flight it was sufficient and offered ample French film options which is a breath of fresh air from the Hollywood fare one usually has to choose from so I give it a high mark.
Brussels to Bangkok via Doha. If I could rate from one to ten this would be eleven Outstanding service wonderful people good food. Simply very good. Well definitely choose Qatar Airways again soon
Do not fly with Vueling. They oversell tickets and my partner does not have a seat. We have to rearrange our schedules and pay so much more and miss out on my partners sisters wedding. I am beyond disgusted I cannot believe I trusted them.
Munich to Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Prepared my online check in to have a good start to my holiday. Arriving at the airport they told me they were unable to use the online check in reservations. Not any reasons given. Just they didnt use it. Now I am sitting in a middle seat in Row 10 instead of an window seat in the back. Please replace people with robots at this airline. If you are not able to do online check in dont offer it.
Doha to Dubai in January 2017 on business with my wife. Had a fairly smooth transfer at the Hamad International in Doha. The departure gate was a considerable distance from the gate of our arriving flight but signage was clear and using the walkways provided got us to the departure gate on time. Departure on time welcoming staff quite clean aircraft for a short flight of about an hour. A very tasty chicken sandwich was provided and beverages. Inflight entertainment was on and could be used. I had my own headphones which I did use A very pleasant airline I would recommend.
Most appalling company policy for refunds especially covid19 related ones. You can not talk to an actual human being it is all done by email or online submission where you just get a stock response of a future travel voucher. I had 9 separate requests over 3 months go back forth where I refused the voucher. They then said I could do a full cash refund but will only refund it after 12 months of the booking date. What type of awful company does that In the end I got my credit card company to issue a chargeback against them which took 2 weeks. Luckily Ill never have to deal with Oman Air again
We booked SFOFLLSJUDOM the last leg being on LIAT. A few days after booking we received an email stating that our SJUDOM flight had been canceled and we would be rerouted through ANU at no additional charge. Inconvenient but we sucked it up. After all it would only be one more hour. Arrival in SJU was stressful. We had to find a LIAT employee to check in and get boarding passes. The transfer service desk was unstaffed and personnel from other airlines told us that they had no idea when a LIAT representative would show. Exited the secure area and checked in at the painfully slow and incompetently staffed checkin counter. The other half waited at the customer service desk inside the airport and checked in when a LIAT representative finally decided to show her face. At the checkin counter I checked in without issue though the computer crashed multiple times. Our 14.50 flight ended up leaving the ground around 1640. Needless to say we missed our onehour connection in Antigua. We were livid. Our plane was the largest in LIATs fleet an ATR72. Nice enough clean and comfortable. No beverage or food service but at this point that was not unexpected. Landing in ANU we were informed that although we had missed our ANUDOM flight the airline graciously scheduled another flight to take us to DOM. There was a single LIAT employee or so it seemed in the entire terminal we initially encountered her at the desk that dealt with passengers in transit. There was a line at this desk that reached out the door of the terminal and onto the tarmac as people needed to get boarding passes for this new flight. The new ANUDOM flight was scheduled for 1830 but we were not surprised when we took off at 1900. The plane was on an old Bombardier. Dont even think about bringing a rollaway bag with you as a carryon. The overhead bins are hardly fit for a handbag. The seats themselves did not recline though were comfortable enough. Again no food or beverages.
This review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on BA 174 from JFK New York to Heathrow on Tue 14th May. I was travelling back from New York following a few days break with 11 girlfriends. Check in and boarding was all on schedulehowever it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue this resulted in over an hours delay leaving NY. Despite this annoying delay the cabin crew more than made up for this. They were friendly polite and couldnt do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable they were all exceptional even those that were not serving in the section I was in. I do hope that this information is passed on.
EgyptAir Business Class MS768 Barcelona to Cairo was bad. The seat was old and uncomfortable it barely reclined and the footrest did not work. The entertainment system on my chair didnt work. I had to change seats and even then the sound had a hissing buzz and the screen so small that it was impossible to read or enjoy a movie. I asked for a seafood meal and I received a salad with four pieces of lettuce two pieces of bread fish and some fruits. Overall the meal was disappointing but the fish fresher than normal on the same flight. The cost of the ticket is disproportionately steep because of the monopoly that the company has on the route. Given the vintage condition of the carrier it should be priced as a nofrills low cost
To those who complain about European LCs I would recommend a Japanese LC as Peach to see that EasyJet or RyanAir are not as bad as they look. Our flight an A320 was so late on arrival to Taipei and departure from Taipei that we landed at Midnight in KIX. Immigration Customs. No more transportation available out of airport which is on an island Peach did not take any measures at least advising taxis and we were just dropped off in an empty airport. They had their profit. They did not care as they had apologized for the delay. Peach sells a TaipeiOsaka 6.50 flight which is late in nearly 70 of the cases. It always arrives close to the last buses out of Osaka Airport. They know it but risk is at passengers expenses.
Tokyo Narita to Dusseldorf. So far the best airline I flew with perectly on time. Cabin crew incredibly friendly and helpful aircraft 1 year old amazingly clean high level of onboard food and drinks very nice entertainment system. A lot of space in economy relaxing seats. Superior in every aspect.
Wonderful service roomy seats for most of the flights love the flight attendants outfits It would be helpful to at least offer water for free and a way to plug in our phones. Wifi would be helpful.
Refusing to pay 73 pp to reserve seats in Business Class a stunt more worthy of Ryanair I checked in two passengers online 20 minutes after online check in opened only to find that one seat was in row 7 and the other in row 11. There was no option to change seats and no phone contact given. I tried to phone the British Airways Kuala Lumpur office but the number given would not connect. I then went to the BA Office listed in Kuala Lumpur only to find it had been closed and moved to another location in Ampang Park. Still having asked several people no one knew of a BA office. Arriving at the airport I was told the flight was full but a change of seats might be possible once on board which proved to be the case. But I then found myself next to a family with three very small children. Although the parents did what they could to amuse the children it was always going to difficult during a 13 hour flight. It was a long night and a very difficult flight. The sight of young children in nappies wandering around is not what I expected in business class. All in all it was a flight in flying nursery which I would rather forget. I now know why other reviewers on this site have used the acronym BA Better Avoid. Business class beware.
Seattle to Taipei. Excellent experience from start to finish from ground staff to crew. Food was good with nice portions. My luggage did not make it onto the flight due to a short connection caused by a delay from a previous domestic flight on a different airline. My bags arrived at my doorstep a few hours after I arrived home. Amazing. Best airline in the world as far as I am concerned.
HanoiHue 14 June on an A321 wellmaintained older aircraft. Arrived to T1 from T2 after international flight. Free terminal bus at Noi Bay airport is very convenient. Checkin easy and superfast for Skypriority card holders they gave me a spacious seat. Lounge access is not granted to VNs domestic routes unless if arrived on international Skyteam flight preferably VN. Paid 20 USD for access to Lotus Lounge which is impressive large wellstocked and truly worth it. Onboard I got just water and a tissue. However they have started to push a trolley around for small additional catering sales. Did not observe in time and lost my chance. Flight almost on time luggage was present at arrival. Surprised there was an airbridge then came the big surprise to my day went into a completely new stunning modern airport in Hue. This shocked me completely it was not there half year ago. Stable oldfashioned airline punctual and good in communication. Generous with luggage. Miles given quickly. Advise bring your own instant coffee sachets and theyll make coffee in a paper mug for you onboard.
Ground Staff and Customer Service Staff are very helpful and supportive. Inflight experience is wonderful and spice max facilities are an added advantage. Thank you and keep up the good work .
TAM administration is a disaster took 3 weeks to establish what a schedule change was because the phone number provided is for LAN who must raise a file number to any TAM query and revert at their leisure. I am a OneWorld Emerald card holder TAM do not despite what their website says and what One World rules say acknowledge fast track departures. At Madrid people were being processed at fast Track I had walk all the way back to join a very crowded general line. They do not extend extra baggage allowance beyond 2 pieces 23kg each. These gifts are only for TAM privileges on their own card system. Onboard the flights TAM were very charming and efficient. Some of the nicest flight attendants around. Boeing 767 has flat seats not overly comfortable in bed position thin blanket and pillow too but a nice roomy and accommodating cabin. Pretty good selection of movies on demand on a decent size bright screen. Food looked good but it was midnight so I didnt eat. Breakfast orders taken to order and served as per. Too bad their ground work is heading the way of LAN who seem to work for the convenience of their employees more than anyone else
Flew London Gatwick to Cancun in business class on a B777 that looked in need of a major refurbishment. The cabin was drab and dated the entertainment screen was small and the choice limited the food was for business class not particularly good quality and poorly presented in particular the second meal on an 11 hour flight was a packet of sandwiches and some cake. I am quite capable of opening my own packet of sandwiches but given the price of flying business class Id have thought BA could make some effort to present the food better. In summary the experience compared very badly to Asian or Middle Eastern airlines Ive used.
Latam Changed my flight schedule so I cancelled my trip. Unfortunately it is not possible for them to return my money because I have a European Bank account. I tried 2 of my personal accounts and now Im trying to transfer it to a Friend in Ecuador so she can transfer me the money. Now its almost 2 months later and I still dont have my money. This overall customer service experience is the worst I have had.
One of the worst experiences on a flight. I was heading out from New Delhi to Bangalore and it was not worth the effort. The seats were not as expected cleaned the seat covers was teared from one side likewise the seat which is allotted to me dont had the seat movable button since it was broken so all through the entire excursion I needed to sit truly awkward.
We were a party of 5 in Papeete heading out for cruise when the Tahitian government shut down all cruises. I contacted Air Tahiti immediately to see if we could get a flight home. The shut down occurred on a Friday and we could not catch a flight home until the following Wednesday which resulted in 5 more hotel nights. Air Tahiti charged us 1048.00 per ticket for the flight home in the same class of service. If we didnt pay the 1048.00 per ticket Air Tahiti wanted to charge us 90.00 per ticket to drop down a class. The Air Tahiti standard pricing between main cabin and business class in normally 3000.00 per ticket the class drop should have resulted in a refund. Do not fly this airline they do not care about servicing their passengers and taking advantage of their customers.
I was able to book online smoothly and easily. Service is no frills but competent. I did not find any particular language barriers during my travel and the rates are definitely way more reasonable than other bigger airlines for domestic Japanese travel. Checkingin and boarding were simple and efficient.
Berlin to Singapore via Istanbul. My luggage was lost. Once it was found they transported it to Japan even so I needed it to be delivered to Australia. later the third time it was by mistake sent to Germany. It took almost 2 weeks until I had my luggage. No compensation hard to get any information and sometimes rude staff. The airplane within Europe was old and the service was poor. The food was good.
Huatulco to Oaxaca. Booked our flights 6 months in advance and a month later they cancelled our flight. We had booked a return trip and one leg was cancelled but they insisted on cancelling both legs and that I buy a new ticket on the one leg that we could use. The company promised a refund for the cancelled flights plus a 25 bonus as it was the airline that had cancelled the booking for operational reasons. They would not reverse the charge on the credit card and insisted that we supply banking information for the refund. We provided all of the information and after several phone calls we still are waiting for the refund 6 months later and no signs of it coming. It appears to me they are running some kind of a scam as I have read a number of reviews with the same complaint. I would suggest if you do not receive your refund in a short period of time ask your credit card company to reverse the charge as the airline has not provided the service. Timing is critical with the credit card company.
I decided to give Viva air a second chance but it has been one of the biggest mistakes Ive ever made. My last experience was horrible and after complaining I received vouchers for the tickets that I had purchased. It turns out that when paying taxes for those tickets it was pretty much like buying a new ticket. The customer service is horrible When I got to the airport this time I expressed my concern about not being able to check in online and the answer that I got is that I made a mistake and I would have to pay 25 dollars for them to check us in. Then I said that I had a small carry on suitcase to bring with me and their trick is that if your personal item doesnt fit in the box that they have designed to measure your luggage you have to pay extra. Well my bag was too big for the box and I ended up paying 30 dollars for my tiny carry on bag to be checked. Am I using this airline again No way T
Norwegian Airlines lost our bags 2 weeks ago. They found them 2 days later but bungledtotally neglected any attempt to deliver them. They do not call you or answer emails. Phone queues are typically over an hour at best even after you find out the right number to ring. Other numbers do not respond at all. The online system that is supposed to tell you the status of your lost baggage is a joke
After a small delay in AMS we departed for short hop to LHR. Boarding went quickly we were assigned emergency exit seats which were very comfortable. At cruising altitude we got breakfast snack. The crew was friendly except the one assigned to our section who wasnt very talkative and a bit snobby. Overall flight experience was great and service is the way we like to see it. British Airways Ranking
Flew British Airways from Oslo to London Heathrow on 19 March. Crew were happy and helpful cabin clean and looked new. It wasnt a new plane but the seats were new. Served a turkey and cheese croissant. Will fly again with BA. Was on time and landed early
Dubai to Kuwait. Excellent service from Kuwait Airways. There were two women from the Kuwait Airways office Dubai that were able to get me onto the flight quite quickly. I wouldve missed my flight if it wasnt for them. Thanks again and looking forward to flying your carrier again for the future.
Vienna to Denpasar via Doha on 11 October wheelchair assistance requested to an from the airplane doors. In Vienna it worked perfectly so in Denpasar. In Doha the service was a shame. We were trapped for about 45 minutes in the elevator which should us brought down. It had about 33 degrees and no AC. Then we had wait on the ground for another 10 minutes for transportation. Let me express my disgust about this issue.
Domestic transfer lost luggage during my flight via Johannesburg. Despite the bag clearly tagged and marked for transfer to Cape Town it was the only bag left behind. Once they did manage to trace it Johannesburg baggage office had no knowledge of it having been there and Cape Town didnt answer phone lines. Several calls later they finally said its now in Cape Town and asked me what happened. Once they delivered the bag to my home the zip was open while the bag was still locked. No reasons provided by the airline on why it was lost or zip was open. Cant trust their transfer service yet I have to travel with them for work.
Toronto to Boston. On the first leg of the journey the gate agent indicated he would call ahead to hold the plane due to a long line at security. He apparently did not as five passengers did not make the flight. On the return flight the gate agent indicated a carry on baggage fee was applicable which I disputed. Once through security two managers followed me and then had my name called not for passport check but to ransom carry on baggage fee. Very poor customer service
Never again on Tigerair. Our flight from Sydney to Gold Coast was delayed for 7 hours from 1200pm to 625pm which took off at 705pm. All they could do is offering us a refund on a condition that we fly with another airline which was impossible to find. When I complained they never apologized but instead they said this is a budget airline which means that long delays should be expected. It was more disappointing that they offered us 15 vouchers per person for lunch and diner. And they had the guts to sell drinks on board instead of giving complimentary drinks due to the 7 hours delay.
Innsbruck to Amsterdam. Travelling back from holiday very early start. Left my jacket in overhead locker. Unfortunately I could not get all my hand luggage etc into one locker and forget I left the jacket in another locker. We were one of the last people to leave the aircraft. I contacted airline help desk 30 minutes after arrival. They said the cleaners must have taken it. They didnt care took no details told me to contact loss and found in the airport. Which required me going out of the departure area finding the lost and found desk. They said I should really go via the airline. I said I did and they then directed me to the online form. Had to go through security again etc. Basically a complete waste of time. Lost a lovely light weight winter jacket 225 plus sunglasses 100.
PisaMunich on ATR72. Great experience. Cabin spotless and flight attendants were professional and friendly. Inflight service started with refreshing towel for hands and face. Then offered Italian wine choices from menu and wine served in a glass plus a sandwich. Wish they flew in the US.
The meals were well below standard of an international flight. Menu had two options for hot cakes and scrambled egg but by the time they reached the middle of the aircraft they only had the one option. They dont provide you drinking water with the meal. The stewardesses are rude and unwelcoming. The inflight entertainment is limited. The seat is uncomfortable and doesnt recline. There are no foot rests.
We were picked up in Miami over 1.5 hrs late. On way home we got to airport over 2 hrs ahead of time and waited for our flight. Flight listed as on time and they boarded us to leave on time but then had to sit in a very hot cabin for over 1hr because they were waiting for late comers to get through customs. This made us miss all our flights out of Miami and when I finally got to Dallas missed any chance of getting home.
Hong Kong to Singapore. Unfortunately took this Cathay Pacific flight in Jan 2018 from HKG to SIN during midnight very sad news was the last minute aircraft changes due to NO reason. From A350 1x2x1 seat configurations to B777 2x3x2 seat configurations the cabin was so narrow very similar to economy class seats. I missed out my meal service I understand passengers may sleep during the midnight flight but there was no one asking about if I am okay to wake up during the meal service after I woke up there was no on asking if I want have some meal before the flight landed. Will not take Cathay Pacific flight again.
Jakarta to Singapore. This was my first time flying with Singapore Airlines and I was impressed. The flight was on time the cabin crew was friendly and courteous. The cabin was really clean. It was a short haul flight which only lasted for 1 hr 45 mnt but really enjoyable. The food was decent for a short haul flight. It has 333 seat arrangement which is great and the legroom was spacious. I wish they could improve more on the flight entertainment system because even though the movie selection was great and had many new titles the touch screen was not responsive and the earphones were not comfortable enough
Baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest. Mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. My second meal was something inedible no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts instead an assortment of dried something. Baggage took 34 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered. A380 is a great aircraft but the BA seating is still the very tired old yinyang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days
I flew from Orlando to Amsterdam in premium comfort class. The flight was actually pretty good. It was on time convenient priced right service was good and the food not too bad. If you compare it to the major long haul carriers ie Delta Lufthansa Virgin etc you will find some areas that do not compare..ie the seats only recline they do not lie flat no power for computers older planes and basic service is offered not over the top like some carriers. I would recommend this carrier as a low cost alternative to the big airline companies.
I enjoyed both of my 12 hour flights to Istanbul and back to Singapore with Turkish Airlines. The food was excellent more than enough inflight entertainment. Good service the cabin crew were there to assist when needed. Overall a very positive experience.
Rome to Sydney via Doha in May. For the return two sectors Qatar Airways did not credit miles to my Qantas frequent flyer account claiming I didnt travel business class on the sectors and the miles were credited to another account. Mileage for the outbound sectors were credited to my Qantas account. After the refusal to credit the miles I wrote twice to their Customer Care providing copies of all documents and my letters were unanswered. My travel agent also provided the documents to the Sydney QR representative and she did nothing. I found the entire experience unsatisfactory.
Singapore to Luang Prabang return in April with a stopover in Vientiane on the outgoing leg to Laos. Second time on SilkAir this year and I was very pleased with the service to Luang Prabang. Checkin went without a hitch and boarding for the flight was quick as it was a low load on the Singapore to Vientiene sector. I was served a total of six times on my flight to Luang Prabang by a very cheerful bunch of cabin attendants snacks drinks wine meals desserts etc The main meal of chicken pasta was alright but I wish they didnt skimp on the salad. Flight wasnt full so I had lots of room to stretch. Arrival in Luang Prabang was on time even with the slight delay in Vientiane. On the return flight it was a direct trip to Singapore without a stopover this time round I think they were running short of wine as they only served this in a cup and didnt give out bottles. The main meal was seafood pasta which was way better than the lunch I got. Once again they skimped on the salad. Inflight entertainment was quirky and the app crashed a lot. Good thing that I got newspapers on both legs of the journey. All in all the cabin crew service was top notch and I really felt that they provided a great service. This airline does have room for improvement but I can say that SilkAir is still quite a worthy and solid performer.
I had a flight on 24 May 2020 from Delhi to Phuket which was cancelled by itself due to pandemic but i have been calling and sending mails since last 78months now but they never respond to any of my mails. They even booked my flight on 13 dec 2020 which they didnt inform me about. GoAir have a really bad service.
Worst customer service experience. First their staff doesnt understand English. Called more than 10 times for one issue still not resolved. Also if complained there staff start shouting. They ask you to hangup so dont have to transfer to call satisfaction survey. They say they cant hang up. Internally very disconnected operation. Had been waiting for finance team to call me since 3 days now to call and take payment for reissue ticket. Most of the time after a 3045 min call you will be told system is down for maintenance.
Hugely enjoyed this trip with KQ. Wonderful to see KQ finally reinstate a full meal service on this route I spoke to the purser who confirmed so many customers were on connecting flights that the company opted to stop the pathetic small pie although Im told on the early morning flight it is still a cold croissant and tiny piece of fruit however on this leg a very impressive three hot meal options wee offered I was the last seat on the last row at the back and they still had all 3 options available and the traditional East African beef pilau was absolutely delicious. Cabin crew wonderfully interactive and as always cannot give you enough drinks two bottles of wine and two lagers each time. One disappointment was the refusal of Lusaka KQ agents to allow me to use my Flying Blue miles to upgrade at the airport despite being assured by KQ HQ that it is was totally possible. I was told I would only get a bar service as they dont cater for additional unknown business class passengers but my return trip just didnt bear this out. I dont think they wanted the hassle of a little extra work to be honest Keep it up KQ your flights are expensive for the flight duration but customers also opt for convenience and service and you have this handsdown.
I am now enjoying the flight from Casablanca to Moscow via Doha. Everything is over expectations On of the best airlines in my opinion. Appreciate the professional service and staff.
We had a flight from Tehran to Auckland via Dubai in January 2020. Due to the Ukrainian flight crash our flight was rescheduled twice by Emirates which means we had to have 20.5 hr of stop in Dubai. We called the airline office in Tehran to see our options of accommodation in Dubai. They said yes due to a stop longer than 13 hrs the airline must provide accommodation for you but they didnt have access to the hotel booking system and asked us to address this issue in emirates airline counter in Dubai airport. We arrived in Dubai and asked about the hotel booking option. Surprisingly they said we cannot have any accommodation provided by airline and it is not their problem We had arguments about the airline policy and they were refusing to show us the policy and just giving us some wrong information that it is in their policy and they cannot provide accommodation. After 2 hrs of discussion and argument they finally provided a twin room for three people. We were really disappointed. I had a surgery on my neck about two weeks before the flight which and had to ask the cabin crew to open the head locker for me. I asked one of the crews for the first time he opened the head locker for me and said dont ask me again to do that for you Ive got back pain. I wont fly with Emirates anymore.
Never used this airline before and will never use it again. Right from the start on boarding from Las Vegas there was a huge delay caused by staff ineptness on baggage checking and boarding order announcements and check in. The departure screen was showing as a departed flight 2hrs after the plane was still boarding passengers on the ground. Total mess. It seemed there was a shortage of flight attendants as they quickly showed up just to dump some pasta and a dry brownie to each passenger then in the morning a bread roll with cheese and I never saw them again. Bottled water was not available even for purchase. The premium economy was taken care for way better by a separate personnel for much higher ticket cost. This is probably the worst experience I ever had in a overnight flight.
Paris to Rio de Janeiro. Not the new best cabin but still very good comfort and the best deal on the route. Night flight with excellent night dinner with superb foie gras and very good choice of wines three white three reds. Flight entertainment is perfect. Air France plus is their breakfast service warm brioche and real expresso on demand. Even their toilets were clean despite a full flight.
Dubai to Sao Paulo. Flying experience nothing out of ordinary but this company doesnt respect customer. They damage my luggage did an agreement in the airport sent the email with the case. Didnt pay and said case closed. Never replied any email or answer phone call.
This airline is indeed a disgrace in the airline industry. I had the worst travel experience of my life in Italy. Upon arrival in Rome we waited for 2 hours at the baggage claim area no one did ever inform us that this airline had a strike and no one knows where our luggage was. We had to spend another 2 hours lining up at the customer service to fill out a claim form and we were told that someone will call us when they find our luggage. Ergo we left the airline empty handed. 3 days had passed no calls and no one was available to pick up our calls we decided to go back to the airport. Hundreds of pieces of luggage were everywhere anyone could freely get any luggage as no one was monitoring it. We only found one of the luggage and the other one went missing. We reported our missing bag via email since as we dont have time to line up for another couple of hours to declare our missing bag as we were headed to our our next destination. Only to be told that they are not responsible for our missing luggage that it is our responsibility to report it to the police. We were really shocked on how these people handle this situation as if they are really used to this kind of situation. Their defense is ignore complaints or concerns like theres nothing wrong. The missing bag is not fault of our own Their crew went on strike their passengers are innocent with whats going on with their company. Its not fair that they dragged us with their misery and screw up our holiday just like that. As soon as I came back home after our vacation I immediately called their customer service their agents were just hanging up on me whenever they hear the purpose of my call. This is truly unbelievable Until now no one hasnt gotten back to us about the status of our missing luggage.
Booked single business class flight from Ho Chi Minh to Manchester an excellent flight on both legs with their old products. I was disappointed it was not qsuite as i wanted to try it out. Had a great sleep on both legs crew were friendly and very attentive especially on the 2nd leg of the flight. Came over on numerous occasions collecting items asking if I required anything. Food was excellent and tasty kept the champagne flowing offering snacks. The business class lounge was excellent serving a la carte menu with full table service would love to spend more time there. I would definitely fly qatar airways again hopefully a Qsuite.
Total unprofessional services from Air Arabia. Zero care for passengers. Flight got postponed for 24 hrs and Air Arabia doesnt have any courtesy to update the reason for the change or provide any compensation or not even reasonable discussions Only response provided is the flight changes are beyond their limit. If it is few hrs we can understand. But how can an airline justify change in flight timing for 24 hrs. I booked premium seats by paying additional amount. And when the flight got changed the new itinerary received removed seat booking just like that and they adjusted the amount as credit. If there is any change in original commitment being an airline company it is Air Arabias responsibility to call customer and inform about the change or removal of some service. Rather they expected customer call them back and the worst part is no one answers the call for more than 40 mins in 2 instances. I would rate less than single star for Air Arabia service. First impression with Air Arabia in overall dealing with customer is much below any acceptable quality standards.
London to New York. Aircraft was very dated IFE poor meal service average no snacks poor drinks service crew exceedingly unfriendly and customer service after the flight abysmal. Seats on these aircraft which have not been refreshed are beyond threadbare and were outdated a decade ago. The meal service has taken a severe cut in recent years. To top everything off the crew couldnt even provide a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest embarrassing When you tell BA about a negative experience theyll waffle on about how great they are but fail to resolve the complaint absolute waste of time dont waste your money flying BA Ive had far more positive experiences on Ryanair.
QR is our favorite airline and each step of travel is pleasant due to the amazing flight attendants. They were so accommodating and pleasant. They looked after all passengers with great attention and professionalism. We noticed on this flight a decline in the onboard service. No mens and womens sleeper suit were available. We found that our food in business class had dropped and was not up to standard. The main courses were arranged very poorly. No hint of fine dining rather food in a canteen. The two desserts were very modest.
Johannesburg to Cape Town. What a really nice flight. Very comfortable seats on time and very pleasant crew. As a South African taxpayer Im so glad Im not having to pay twice for the same trip as is the way with state owned airlines here. Keep up the good work Airlink.
Quito to Bogota. This airline company is the worst I have experienced. They cancelled my flight in January 2017 and promised me a full refund. Now after 6 months and many emails tofrom their customer service I have not received my money. They are trying to run me tired by playing stupid and asking me to send the same information again and again. I strongly advise not to fly with VivaColombia.
Flew from Sofia to Rome. Very rude crew staff. No one smiled. When the plane was landing one of the flight attendants came up to ask me to close the table I was sleeping so I didnt hear the announcement. I did what she told me then asked her to take my glass of water. She told me to keep it and just walked away before I could open my mouth to protest.
Monteria to Medellin. I travelled with a friend who had one small bag and a tiny bag and the gate staff made a whole fuss concerning the two bags. After moving the tiny bag into my own bag she finally agreed to label our bags. The plane wasnt even half full so there was no problem regarding space. She was just interested in charging 80000 Colombian pesos. Ridiculous and pathetic attempt at charging such a small amount of stuff for a weekend break. We were of course given seats far apart 6e and 24a as this tactic encourages passengers to purchase seats together. Beware
A big improvement over the same leg 15 months earlier. British Airways in Economy from Heathrow to Miami outbound business class Chicago to Heathrow inbound. Lounge service in Chicago excellent for me Mum and acceptable for my daughter this time there was at least some simpleish food which was childfriendly. Staff were friendly to the children on both legs took time to fill out her flyer logbook.
This used to be a very pleasant airline to fly with but now we have had such dreadful experiences with them recently. Here are 3 1. We plan to travel as a family of 4 to the United States in October 2020 flying GenevaMunichNew York and returning New YorkBrusselsGeneva. The flight New YorkBrussels is a Brussels AirlinesUA flight on October 24. We purchased the ticket online via a German travel agent. Recently we received an email from Brussels Airlines indicating that the New YorkBrussels leg of the trip had been cancelled. Despite extensive and repeated efforts on our part and despite very clear European Union rules in this area Brussels Airlines refuses to rebook us on another flight. They consistently argue that the travel agent should rebook us. However the travel agent will charge us a rebooking fee of 49 EUR per person a total of 196 EUR for a 4person family. The European Union rules are unequivocal that the airline is responsible for rebooking. Brussels Airlines avoids all responsibility. A second matter concerns 7 travel legs cancelled by Brussels Airlines during the period of confinement MarchJune 2020 for which I am seeking reimbursement. Brussels Airlines has sent me on a repeated loop in which the website tells me I need to contact them via Facebook or Twitter and then Facebook tells me I need to make this request via the website. Again the EU rules are clear Brussels Airlines is obliged to reimburse. To date it appears that they are exclusively focused on avoiding their legal obligations. In July 2019 we flew to the US on a direct flight BrusselsNew York on a saturday. Brussels Airlines did not manage to put our luggage on the plane. As our girls were starting camp on Monday we were forced to buy replacement items on the Sunday. Our luggage arrived Monday. Brussels Airlines refused absolutely to reimburse the cost of the replacement items. Avoid this airline if at all possible.
Ryanair just spoilt my holidays. They started boarding too early and kept people outside under the rain when the temperature was about 8 degrees during 40 minutes. The airplane wasnt prepared for boarding why After that 25 hours flight like in the fridge. t the end I arrived with a cold and thanks Ryanair you spoil my holiday.
Ottawa to Tampa. Absolutely the worst experience flying with any airline. Seats so tight together that my sore arthritic knees were forced up against the seat in front of me. The tray table if I had been able to use it would have hit me in the chest. I have been flying since I was 5 years old and so I have 55 years experience when I say that flying has never been so uncomfortable. Top this off with the rudeness we were met with everywhere we turned especially at check in at the Air Canada counter in Ottawa. Rude impatient and dismissive treatment. It was truly a horrible experience. Because of the lack of space it was very warm and made us feel claustrophobic. The passengers on the flight kept getting out of their seats as a result. My husband was hit by the cart each time it went by. We are people not cattle.
Whilst I dont expect too much from economy I have to say I was very disappointed with British Airways from Gatwick to Mauritius. I chose this airline as I expected the planes to be in good condition and the room slightly better for someone of my height. Instead the seat was so worn out I could feel the frame underneath and the legroom appalling. The staff were very polite and attentive but the food left a lot to be desired.
London Heathrow to Dubai and I feel sorry for British Airways. I have just flown one of my last ever flights with them as they have fallen into the depths of being second rate against far superior competition. The lounges at T5 Heathrow should be great but we arrived last night at 6pm to find almost all the food offer finished so its soup or a jacket potato and beans then So much nicer to spend 20 and buy a decent meal from one of the many eateries in T5 instead. Then onto the plane which was tired. As usual bits of all 4 of our seats were broken. My wifes tv. My sound only worked in the left ear. A really dirty blanket and no spares at all. Very late food service. But to be fair and for a change the stewardesses werent their usual BA indifferent style but fairly good and certainly polite. But this is business class and it certainly doesnt feel like it any more. I try to support British jobs but Emirates is cheaper and better.
I have made several attempts to speak with someone but all attempts have failed. Finally today April 25 2020 I was able to speak with an agent from Expedia. Unfortunately after spending over an hour with her and then escalating to a supervisor there was still no consideration for the current circumstances. On I purchased two airline tickets for my daughter and son in law. Flight 3971 was to depart on 05152020 at 255pm from Dallas arriving in Mexico City Flight 2466 at 535 leaving at 750pm to our final destination Puerto Vallarta arriving at 915. Their returning flight 2463 was scheduled to leave Puerto Vallarta on 05192020 at 110pm arriving in Mexico City at 245. Leaving Mexico City on flight 3972 at 635pm arriving back in Dallas at 915pm. I must add that I purchased insurance for these tickets however cannot speak with anyone with that group neither. As we are all aware due to the Covid19 situation there are things that are out of everyones control. On Friday April 24 2020 ExpediaInterjet emailed me to advise that they were changing the details to the original flight dates. They gave us no choices besides 1 and it was take it or leave it. Please note not only were the times of the flights changed which is no biggie but the dates are way off in comparison to our original dates WE purchased. Please note that my daughter and son in law needed to return specifically on May 19 2020 as they have 2 small children and can not be away from them additional days aside the 4 originally planned. Interjet is now wanting them to return 2 days later with no other options. The return date is not an option. I called Expedia today and they advised that they are not able to issue a refund. I then asked for a credit and they were willing to do so. However they want to issue the credit in my daughter and son in laws name. I explained that I paid for the tickets and wanted the credit in my name as I travel more. Bottom line that I paid for them and they are able to see this. The supervisor from Expedia then called Interjet and asked for an exception. Reminder that Interject changed my plans not me. The manager at Interjet said that they could not issue a refund but he would be willing to issues the credits in my name for a fee of 118.00 each ticket. Yes thats right Interjet will not give me a refund for a flight they changed. Interjet will however give me credit for an additional fee even though they initiated the change. I believe my request is reasonable. Id like a refund but if its not an option why not give the person credit who paid for the tickets. The supervisor recommended that I do a chargeback with my bank however this is not a fraudulent situation nor am I disputing the charge. Im asking for the 2 credits to be issued in my name as my daughter and son in law will not be able to travel those dates nor use a voucher in the next 12 months. Its so hard to wrap my mind around the thought of the airline not wanting to be more flexible in times like this. Our condo was canceled and most business are closed in Puerto Vallarta. There is no reason to travel there now was its unsafe and too soon to expect everything is normal.
London to Manila return via Istanbul. Check in was very quick we checked in 3 large suitcases with our 80kgs combined allowance we also had two carry on trolley cases a rucksack and suit holder asked if we could check in the rucksack to save dragging it around with us even though we were on the check in limit yes sir no problem. Spent time in the business class lounge to wait for boarding. Arrived at the boarding gate checked through boarded the plane first. Flight London to Istanbul was 4 hours approx seat was very comfortable flight attendants very good and spoke perfect English. There was a chef who came round and took our order for our meal. The food was excellent. IFE was good but not great could do with upgrading but acceptable. We arrived in Istanbul on time and were bussed to the terminal business class passengers were off the plane first and had there own bus. we had about two hours. so spent time in the Turkish Airlines Lounge then headed to our gate to board our plane for Manila. this is the only fault I found with this trip. There was no business class priority boarding just everybody trying to to get through the check in and only one member of staff checking tickets and passports absolutely ridiculous it was mayhem finally got through the check in and were last to board a waiting bus I would not have liked to be first on the bus to take us to the aircraft. We were welcomed on board by the flight attendants and given a pre flight drink and our suit holder was hung up for us. The seats were comfortable and spacious and turned into a flatbed with the ottoman at the foot and for once I actually slept during the flight which is a rarity for me. The IFE was the same as mentioned before Our section of the business cabin had 28 seats which less than half were occupied. Flight attendants were very attentive spoke perfect English. The chef came round asked to fill out a menu card for our breakfast at the end of our flight and also took our order for our meal again it was a fantastic meal the best we have had in the air. We were a little late taking off from Istanbul for our 12 hour flight but still arrived at Manila 1 hour early. We were first off the plane through immigration got to the carousel to pick our luggage our 4 bags because of the priority tags were in the first 10 bags we were out of Manila airport 25 minutes after getting off the plane. Our return trip was just as good if not better as the boarding situation for the London flight at Istanbul was much better organised. Would I use this airline again most definitely.
Outbound flight FRAPRN A319. 2 hours 10 min flight. I thought drinkssnacks for sale but sandwich soft drinks were served complimentary. Inbound flights SKPLJUFRA CRJ900. each 1 hour 30 min flight. Skyshop menu was in a seat pocket and drinkssnacks were for sale. All flight crews were friendly. Security check at the Ljubljana airport for transit passengers was chaos however its possible to go to a gate within 30min.
LGW to Havana via Holquin. Flight 2 hrs late. Plane was good staff ok food good and plenty of leg room. The only downside was the entertainment it was awful mostly reruns and on the return 2 weeks later they showed exactly the same. For a 12 hr flight very poor. On return plane sat on runway for 40 mins but landed at LGW on time Couldnt hear or understand any messages over tannoy system. Toilets clean and tidy. On return at Havana they tried to charge us for overweight cases even though they were both well under the 30kilos allowance. Overall Cubana Airlines were very good and we would travel them again.
Lagos to Tripoli was ok except the deplorable condition of the toilet no inflight entertainment cabin crews were boring beyond description meal was ok. Landed at Tripoli airport on time and cheerful ground crew. I have never seen a worse and appalling toilets like what I saw at the Tripoli airport. Tripoli to Gatwick flight was ok a better and newer aircraft more responsive cabin crew inflight entertainment though without headset arrived Gatwick on time. Return flight was almost a replication of the inbound flights except that there was headset for inflight entertainment. Afriqiyah should replace aircraft flying Lagos leg its below international standard and they dare not fly such aircraft to Gatwick. Will fly them if they improve on the hygiene
Munich to Warsaw via Berlin. Air Berlin was late about an hour at boarding at departure 2hrs. In Berlin I had to transfer to connecting flight to Warsaw which was to depart 30 min before the first flights late arrival. Hustling off the plane there was no bus to bring us to the terminal which literally was 15m away. After 5 min there was a bus to bring us these 15m. Inside the terminal I was running to catch the next flight. It took about 5 min just to notice me boarding the plane right next to the one I came in with. After having seated we were told that we need to wait for another 30min because one passenger did not show up but his luggage was loaded so it had to be unloaded. About 2h late departure. Arrived in Warsaw I was told my luggage did not arrive because there was too short time in Berlin to transfer my luggage. Air Berlin staff knew this already in Berlin but decided to tell us upon arrival in Warsaw. However how was there 30 min to unload luggage but not to load transfer luggage Being left without christmas presents and without any clothes one day before christmas I was also told that before 2 days after christmas I cannot really expect my luggage. Thank you Air Berlin for ruining christmas. Never again.
Tenerife to Manchester. Due to a medical circumstance missed my original flight home and could only secure Premium Economy with Thomas Cook the following day. Expensive for 2 one way tickets but no choice really. You get a generous baggage allowance 25kg selected seating free drinks on board and a meal. The flight boarded on time I was a little taken aback how minimal the legroom was there was no additional space for premium economy whilst I wasnt expecting a suite or a flat bed I was expecting at least an inch extra but no. The 4 hour journey was a little uncomfortable thankfully the lady in front didnt recline her seat I would have been in big trouble if she had. I dont understand why airlines on short haul Europe still have reclining seats with such small leg room provided. Meal was very tasty and the cabin crew were excellent very friendly and provided a real service not a scratch card sale insight.
I wanted to pay and upgrade my seat to one with extra legroom for Doha to Seattle leg I asked in Chennai Airport and they said they couldnt do it and asked me to do it in Doha airport. At Doha airport they told me it was too late and it cannot be done.
Boarding on time but unfortunately from ORTs worst boarding gate which obviously was beyond BAs control. Crew were good but lacked the personal touch. Old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space and the 777 was showing its age. However we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites. The cabin crew were good food ok wines a little disappointing. Overall a decent flight.
Theyre currently using elderly A330 on the Nairobi route and these arent very comfortable compared to the B787 or B777 they used to bring to Nairobi. Terrible seat pitch. Tiny faded IFE screens and the dreaded metal box under the seats that takes up half your legroom. And not enough room for carry on luggage if the plane is full. My flight from Doha to Nairobi was packed to the rafters so they were randomly selecting passengers to give up their hand luggage so that it could be put in the hold so as not to overwhelm the overhead bins on board. I had my standard cabinapproved trolley bag which I was told needed to be checked in. I had to remove my electronics and valuables and stuff these in my laptop bag to carry on board. I was given a flimsy zip tie to secure my bag and off it went into the hold. On arrival in Nairobi it was one of the last bags to make it to the luggage conveyor belt. The flight was a night flight so I opted to get some sleep rather than wait for dinner. After managing to fall asleep I was awoken twice to be asked if I wanted to have dinner which I clearly did not. On the plus side the flight was bang on time to the minute only marred by the long wait for baggage on arrival. Nairobi is a busy route for QR most of their flights are full so I dont know why they put such a mediocre airplane type on it.
Jetstar Pacific cancelled our flight from Wellington to Auckland for mechanical failure yet again. Had to pay a premium to fly at last minute with a more reliable airline. Do not book Jetstar Pacific if you need a flight for business it is too unreliable. Cheap flights but not good service if they cancel a flight. It is not worth the extra expense when you have to rebook elsewhere.
Adria serves this 100 min flight from Ljubljana to Amsterdam on a brand new CRJ900 Next Gen which has a hugely improved cabin. Much more spacious higher ceiling and with big windows. The seats seem to be more comfortable and have more legroom. The business class is not separated from the main cabin though not even with the standard back seat curtain. The food offering could be slightly improved for usually Ive had good meals on Adria.
If your trip is important never ever fly with GoAir. This was the first time I chose this aircraft and it was a big mistake. I booked my tickets from Hyderabd to Kannur via Bangalore round trip for 29th of Dec to attend my cousins wedding on the 30th. This was our familys last wedding and everyone has traveled even from abroad to attend this event and Im sitting at home. Thanks to GoAir for cancelling the flight on 28th night and leaving me with no other option to travel with my 1.5 year old child. I strongly suggest this aircraft GoAir should be black listedBanned as they do not value customer needs. Their services should be stopped immediately as it could put lot more people in serious trouble.
Los Angeles to London. I booked with AA LAX to LHR round trip very far in advance. BA is AA partner. Paid for the BA seat selection early to get good seats. BA canceled the flights coming and going BA did not inform AA or me that the flights were canceled. All of my text and phone number was entered with BA with my passport number. They should have contacted me. I found out a couple days before my flight because I happened to call to do a meal request. It turns out that BA shifted to smaller planes and I actually spent six hours over two days trying to get flights on the days I needed to catch up with a tour. All they said is we cant help you. I kept calling and calling and got seats on the days I needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed Premium Economy was awful. Food was terrible. We had pre paid 276 to choose seats. There were no good seats left. We ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets. Which meant the smell people are bumping into you the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours. Same seats coming home. I would have been better off flying in coach. I have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection. I tried to get this before my return flight started because I was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refunds.They wouldnt refund. After returning I made five phone calls and spent 30 mins filling out a detailed request online. Called again today was disconnected twice and told there is nothing I could do. It is possible I may get a response in a month regarding my email request. Dont ever fly with them They used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service. If you have a problem you will be up a famous creek without a paddle. They have an endless loop of calling waiting on line their agents cant or wont do anything but sell seats. I spoke to many many supervisors no results. There is no one to solve problems. They pass the buck have you fill out forms online and no one responds.
East Midlands to Guernsey on an ATR72. Nice to have a proper airline service with a person to check in your bag plus complimentary drinks and newspaper on board. Aircraft clean and presentable departed on time but arrived slightly late due to strong head winds. Flight a little bumpy in parts. Cabin crew service efficient and with a smile. Good flight price. Would fly with Aurigny from my local airport again.
FRA to JFK still a good and safe airline but massive cut downs and not perfect any more. On the first leg one one hand a very nice and helpful crew which was on the other hand not very visible for customers in a very empty plane only when you asked for something the helped you then however very friendly. No welcome drink No amenity kit provided on both legs. No menus. The flight attendant explained they had only lamb stew or pork belly to offer for dinner. I can eat lamb and I did but I know many people do not like lamb neither would eat pork the meal was oK but definitely not Business Class quality. No vegetarian option. Same thing on the flight back JFK to FRA only 2 options. On the flight back the crew was more visible. The seats in Business Class are not so comfy as expected but still very good giving you a lot of privacy compared with Lufthansa Business Class. Good entertainment with good classical selection I am a fan of classical music
Manchester to Philadelphia. I booked my flights through British Airways but the flights were American Airlines. I booked a gluten free meal both ways using the field in the booking form that BA had provided. When the meals came round I was told that BA had not passed on my dietary requirements and all they could offer me was a small salad half a tomato and some lettuce. When I landed I emailed British Airways to complain and ask them to ensure I had a gluten free meal on my return. I received no reply and again there was no food for me on the flight. After countless emails I finally received a message telling me that even though British Airways had a field on their form to ask for my dietary requirements I should have contacted American Airlines to request it. British Airways apparently pick and choose which information they send to the carrier airlines. I told them that they shouldnt ask for information that they dont intent to pass on but was met with the same you should have requested it better line. They are truly incompetent at one point they started talking about my child which I dont have. 010 for customer service.
Never ever fly Emirates if it is outside the Gulf region they are good only for short distance local sectors in the gulf especially to Asian cities like Hong Kong Bangkok or Singapore. My trip to Bangkok and Hong Kong last week was a trauma or a nightmare I cant get over with them misplacing my luggage on both flights back to back and then in Bangkok it wasnt delivered until I had to leave the country when I got it from their departure counter just in time to leave the country. In Hong Kong they misplaced it erroneously according to the response of the customer service staff only to have it delivered the next day to my hotel. Also their customer service staff is irrational and do not respond in time to queries unless few email reminders are sent to them. Id never recommend Hong Kong at all since Emirates does not have a counter there to attend to baggage misplaced by them it is outsourced to an agency Jardine services who dont speak English properly. Their A380 planes not having a proper recliner seat for many passengers even despite being an 8.5 hour flight.
Flying 34 times every year since 2008 my last experience was very disappointing. Besides domestic there is no traffic during the day at Papeete Faaa airport and then late at night they schedule 3 international flights all due to leave within a short hour and this airport cant handle it. I arrived 4 hours before departure and the line for checkin immigration and luggage check were endless. I was booked on TN8 seat 11A to Paris via LAX and after pulling out we came back to the parking stand because of an engine problem. We were told it would take an extra 3 hours to change it. They decided to serve us the light cold snack. The previous times I flew we used to have a full hot meal with wine it is obvious ATN is cutting costs and service. Finally airborne 4 hours behind schedule we were expecting to be served a round of drinks but nothing on this 8 hours flight until an hour before touching down in LAX they served us breakfast. The 11 hour flight to Paris went without problem but no round of water or drinks served between lunch and breakfast. Unfortunately due to the monopoly ATN has on these routes I will have no choice but to fly with them again.
Very disappointing when you think how much they charge. We had a super holiday in the Seychelles but had to return to the UK on Air Seychelles. Delayed in Frankfurt for 3 hours the cabin was very scruffy and worn. Not recommended they did not even have the courtesy to respond properly when I emailed my complaints.
Tenerife to Gatwick in February 2018 they canceled a flight lying the all day not admitting that and keep saying the flight was just delayed. Online was clearly written cancelled they were very saying was not true. They lied until 22.30 when the flight was cancelled We asked if they can give us food voucher and drinks they didnt. We asked if you could leave the airport and go to sleep paying ourselves our accommodation they said that they were arranging accommodations for us. Of course at 1 in the morning they said that unfortunately they couldnt find any accommodation. The day after the flight was scheduled for 9 am no one from Thomas Cook showed up until 12. We left again with 3 hours delay but this time after 24 hours at the airport they gave us 10 euros vouchers for food When we arrived in London they gave us a paper saying they apologies and they will give us a refund of 200 each plus expenses. And we are July now and its since February that I am trying to speak with them sent I dont even remember how many emails called the customer service wrote on Twitter they never got back to me.
I had the best experience I have ever had with an airline. Our initial flight to Dubai was canceled By Royal air Maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute. I found that booking with them was extremely simple. Unfortunately we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure. I called the customer service waited about 20 minutes before I could speak with someone and within 15 minutes the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund. The person on the line was extremely nice understanding and willing to help us. I had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline. I got the full refund on my credit card the day after. I usually chose the cheapest flight ticket regardless of the airline but from now on Ill definitely make sure to check with British airways first.
We were very pleasantly surprised with our experience in Premium. We normally fly Premium Economy on British Airways and this was a far better experience the plane was lovely and new and the crew were much friendlier. The premium experience on board is good nice to have additional space and a private section of the cabin and the crew were generous with drinks. The food was fine and we were pleased to be served two hot meals on the way out. Our checked bags came off very promptly at both ends the Premium labels did seem to make a difference. The only slight negative was that our flight left Gatwick late afternoon and the Premium check in line took longer than the normal one as they seemed to give priority to those checking in for next mornings flights. Strange but didnt spoil the overall experience.
GRULHR 15 March 2015. Returned to BA this last 3 flights solely due to Avios companion coupon but purchased this tkt. Bossy cabin crew in the like of BA as we remember its glory days. GT always welcome but skimpy and only one and no nibbles Wine was good this flight. South America routes still dogged with ageing 747 as opposed to Lufthansas modern or upgraded fleet. Outbound from LHR my TV didnt work but they did credit me 3000 avios. Food okay but snacks for such a long flight poor. KLM and AF do it better.
Volotea has rigorously complied with the departure and arrival times. The crew has been very friendly attentive and helpful. The cleanliness inside the aircraft is remarkable. The soft The baggage policy has allowed me to travel with everything I need for a twoweek holiday at no extra cost. I will continue to travel with Volotea and recommend this airline.
Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. Checkin was relatively quick and efficient. Enjoyed the lounge and its vast amenities ahead of boarding. On board the hard product looked in decent shape with comfortable seating in both upright and lieflat positions. My request to be relocated to another seat was honoured allowing me to travel with a vacant neighbouring seat. Catering was once again below the standard I had previously experienced on this carrier and definitely below business class catering on the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers. There is clear evidence they are cutting corners with catering which is unfortunate as it used to be their main differentiator. The FAs were attentive and promptly responded to requests. The biggest issue in flight was the cabin temperature which was uncomfortably hot and took a long time to regulate after many passengers complained. Also the toilets could have used more attention which I had to point out on two occasions. The IFE was OK and had a decent selection of movies and a great music library. The free wifi worked well throughout the journey. We were late departing but arrived on schedule. Upon landing we disembarked via the stairs as we did the last time I traveled on this route. This was despite vacant air bridges. Overall it was a good experience but TK has to reverse the downward trend in their catering quality and return to the high standards they used to have.
No communications about the procedure to fly with Wizz Air from Saudi Arabia. No transit allowed. Full visa fees charged and noone talked anything about at the moment of purchasing. Delay 2 hours for the departure. Absolutely no service at all. Bad experience my advice is pay little more and never do the mistake to purchase with Wizz Air
I booked economy class travel from Melbourne to Ahmedabad because I wouldnt hesitate to change my plans but Malaysia Airlines customer service made it very difficult for me to do so. I had been trying to change our return date from Ahmedabad to Melbourne for the past 10 days and while they were able to change my wifes itinerary they were unable to do the same for me. Despite my repeated calls I finally spoke to a representative who informed me that I cant change your ticket from Ahemdabad because its connected to Air India so she suggested I change from Mumbai to Melbourne and then back to Ahmedabad. I agreed to call air India and paid around 149 for the difference but the next day when I called air India they told me to contact Malaysia airlines so now I have to pay from Ahmedabad to Mumbai out of my own pocket. I tried to contact them many times but they put me on hold and never called back so I think this is the worst experience Ive ever had with Malaysia airlines. Worst experience Ive had. Customer service at its worst.
Flight was delayed 4 hours. At first we were put off with a 1 hour delay although it was clear that it would be 4 hours since there was no plane in Nuremberg. This first had to be procured because the preflight did not take place due to the crew exceeding their working hours. The statutory compensation has not taken place until today 23.3.23. Smartlynx just doesnt react anymore and plays dead. Stay away from Smartlynx you dont know how long they can hold out for such a chaos financially Flug hatte 4h Verspatung. Erst wurden wir vertrostet auf 1h Verspatung obwohl klar war dass es 4h werden da ja kein Flugzeug in Nurnberg vorhanden war. Dies musste erst beschafft werden da Vorflug wegen Arbeitszeituberschreitung der Crew nicht stattfand. Die gesetzlich vorgesehene Entschadigung hat bis heute 23.3.23 nicht statt gefunden. Smartlynx reagiert einfach nicht mehr und stellt sich tot. Finger weg von Smartlynx man wei auch nicht wie lange sie so ein Chaos finanziell durchhalten
New York JFK to Paris CDG. One of the worst flights ever. Though we are allowed 5kg yes only 5kg of carry on luggage at the airport I am informed there is no overhead compartment for small suitcases. When I ask for options instead of answering my question they take me to the manager make me wait for 30min and then accuse me of making a scene. When they all calm down they explain I can use the storage under the seat which is ok by me and I checkin the carryon. Though the plane simply does not have overhead compartments for the middle section. To avoid issue it is worse to pay to pick a seat on window side. Otherwise hot flight with zero AC totally inedible food service absent central entertainment is very low quality. Only positive is the price.
A memorable flight with the A380. Its a pity that the A380 model is about to withdraw from market. They still keep this route during the epidemic and this is my fifth time fly on this A380 from Guangzhou to Los Angeles in the past few years. The good boarding excellent cabin service and comfortable seats left me a deep and warm impression.
I was supposed to fly on SQ25 to Singapore via Frankfurt. The flight was canceled after we are at the gate for 4 hours past the departure time without any explanation. Being flown with SQ for many times I suspect this had to do with JFK rather than the airline. However they should still bear the responsibility for addressing to their customers. We were rebooked to the nonstop SQ23 to Singapore the following day. We ended up on the A350900XLR which was quite nice but I still prefer their A380. Due to the flight change we did not get our book the cook meals. Inflight service was quite nice as expected from SQ.
Bristol to Guernsey a 45 minutes flight. Top marks it could not have been better if we were royalty. Will be using again in a few weeks going back for another wonderful holiday in Guernsey.
Check in was prompt but the fight was delayed 2 hours due to unexpected windshield wiper replacements. British Airways cabin crew was not the friendliest or most professional. I have never felt attendants to be so indifferent and self absorbed. I was never asked what I wanted to order. I was simply brought what they chose. I asked for sparkling water and was informed they had run out. I asked for more bread and was informed they has run out. Dessert was down to one selection. In all the service was lacking at best. The food was mediocre and the selection was subpar. The seats were comfortable and the pod seating was quite good. Flight entertainment is reminiscant of American Airlines from the 1990s very very disappointing. The most disturbing was the three seatbelt checks all while my belt was visibly around the sleeping blanket. The ammenity kits are of economy class standard on most other airlines. Lavs were not kept clean. I can honestly say I will never fly British Airways again. This was a waste of a 5000.00.
LHRTUNISLHR out 1 Oct return 11 Oct 2013. Flight delayed 1 hour both times hot meal provided on both flights even in economy. Newer A320 both ways crew pleasant no real complaints except the late departures
The checkin process is always a breeze. This is probably the best thing about SingAir. Boarding is also a quick process. Most of the planes are a bit aged. Thus the screen or the audio jack may not work. The newer planes have better legroom. Although I always sneeze whenever I ride their planes therefore the seats may not be disinfected regularly. They try to have a variety of dishes but if you ride SingAir frequently you will notice that the names of the dishes may change but the taste is just the same. I always like their salads. The crew do their job like clockwork and thats about it just like an automatic clock. No personalised service no understanding the needs of the passengers. Ive been to a lot of flights with SingAir and you may have 1 or 2 passengers who can be a bit demanding and needy but the rest are understanding. Frequent flyers know that they have a hundred and million things to do but being an attendant is like a profession just like being a doctor who commits himselfherself to every patient under their care. That is the demand of the job. Lastly it is very rare that SingAir flights are delayed but in the rare occasions that they are SingAir does not offer provisions for passengers who are inconvenienced by it. We dont need fancy hotels but maybe a space where we can relax other than the airport chairs or offer a massage or offer a meal or drink. Other airlines do that why cant SingAir Overall SingAir is still a good airline if you are not very particular about things like the attendants being sensitive and aware that passengers are people that they should be taking care of or that the food tastes the same even though the names are different or hey dont offer anything to passengers who are inconvenienced with the delays.
Prague to Hamburg. Does not matter that the luggage compartments were free the Gate Personnel took my cabin luggage. It does not matter that my luggage met all the requirements for cabin luggage declared and recorded in the Electronic Ticket.
Istanbul to Izmir. We booked the flight online 8Q 162 Onur Air cancelled the flight and did not offer an alternate flight. When we got to the airport we were told theres nothing we can do. We never got a refund or anything. We had to buy a ticket on another airline to fly to Izmir
They are so poor so unfair with clients Dont do again The flight was canceled and they send us to a hotel with lower that 1 star smell bad no hot water etc. Now they not answering at the phone we dont know nothing
Mumbai to Edinburgh via London. Im quite surprised to read the varied reviews as I have always had a great experience with BA in terms of inflight service and airport handling. After sales service can be a different experience This flight I arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues hot and sweaty and the checkin girl was such a blessing. She calmed me down reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly. I was able to secure a very cheap lastminute upgrade to Premium Economy and I am so glad I did. The service was wonderful we were looked after very well lots of water offered throughout the flight. I thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable even for the regular upgrade price 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in the centre gives you a lot more space. The food was ok Ive had worse Ive had better. But I was comfortable a good temperature and had a great choice of films. My connecting plane was late leaving Heathrow to Edinburgh due to bad weather but it was handled very nicely. All in all Im glad I flew BA for this trip.
Mexico City to Houston. Never use this airline. Cheap flight cost means no service. The information given at the airport is never correct. The website on the phone should update with gate information and it does not. The people at the counters have no idea what they are doing or any regard for foreign travelers. We spent the time between our connecting flights running back and forth between gates. When we asked about the correct gate the staff responded irritated that we were asking. Definitely not worth the cheaper ticket price for the hassle we experienced.
Almaty SaintPetersburg is my favourite route. Flight was on time. Aircraft was brand new A320NEO 2 months old. Service was excellent food was very good choice of beverages perfect. Now airline using eco packs for amenity kits and it looks so good And also inside of the kit they even put neck pillow because flight was longer than 5 hours.
Emirates has been using the 777 to serve HKG ever since the start of the pandemic it used to be the A380. The 777 has a strange business class configuration of 2x3x2. Who wants to be the unlucky fellow to sit in the middle of the 3 paying premium price The service is OK but not great either. Food was as bland as ever the seat is really narrow and uncomfortable. OK for a short to medium haul flight up to about 6 hours anything longer than that would be an ordeal. Still one redeeming grace is that they sell this short leg at a very attractive price so that is acceptable.
I havent boarded just yet. Flight was cancelled by the airline. Been really looking forward to the flight as Im visiting my family that I dont get to see that often. Whats shocking is that in order to change the ticket I need to pay even though airline is the one who cancelled the flight and customer service is not available. On the phone queue for 3 hours already and no answer. Im lost for words. Is there anyone at all who is willing to help or we just cash in these days Disappointed is just understatement
LCYJERLCY in ATR42s each way. This airline tries hard but falls short in some areas. Online checkin did not work at the advertised time 48 hours. I called customer services and the rather indifferent phone operator casually told me it was always like that. Secondly passengers should be aware of their unusual baggage allowance. The checked plus carryon can total 20 kg. Nevertheless carryon weight was not checked at either LCY or JER. We arrived at City Airport and couldnt find the bagdrop desk told to use the Luxair desk. Aircraft itself was showing its age and could do with a deep clean but was comfortable. One member of cabin crew for 50 passengers and each way they were cheerful and pleasant. On the outbound morning flight a croissant with butter and jam was offered with nonalcoholic drinks. On the return evening flight there was a full bar service even champagne but no snacks. Blue Islands passengers can use their dedicated lounge at JER. However its based at gate 7 which is at the far end of the airport and not air conditioned. Drinks biscuits and wifi were good. Overall a good airline but should certainly bring their London operations more into line with their competitors.
The British Airways outbound flight from London to Hong Kong was on a 3 year old A380. We sat near the back on the upper deck and were very pleased with how comfortable and smooth it was. On the upper deck there is a cupboard by the window seat which gives more space to put your coats and also doubles up as a shelf to put your drinks. The 5 year old Boeing 777 on the return leg was far more cramped. Also the video screen was faulty and it was difficult to click on the screen. The crew on all flights were fine but nothing special. Just performed their job but never really seemed to go out of their way.
Cancelled my original flight 12h booked me on a flight that I could not take due to connecting flight and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting.
Dubai to Stockholm. Excellent check in at DXB separated from Economy class passengers. Business lounge in DXB has really poor offers for breakfast. Disappointed. Boarding not great. Business class passengers have to give priority to economy class. Strongly recommend Emirates to change policy. I felt the seat is narrow 2x3x2 seating in business class. No such experiences with CX SQ LH BA or SK. Extensive film and CD selection but the info and guidance for choosing films in the paper Magazine were irrelevant. Hence ended up listening to Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Strongly recommend Emirates to present the films in a better way. For lunch there was a selection and obviously made I the wrong choice. Cannot blame Emirates but other passengers are recommended to make safer bets.
Zagreb to London and during the checkin 24 hours before I checked in via app I was offered no choice of seating. During the flight I was asked by stewardess if I would like any food I find that approach not pleasant at all. I was not personally invited to use the Lounge. I find that lacking for a business class fare.
We booked the AswanAbu Simbel excursion thinking wed fly on an Egyptair aircraft but what we found at Aswan airport was an old DC9 of this previously unknown company called Air Memphis. The flight was ok but I wouldnt recommend the same experience to anybody. The airplane was old and smelly seats were broken no safety demonstration and fantasy names on our boarding cards. Im an experienced flier but this was one of the worst experiences in my life dont do the same mistake and if you want to visit Abu Simbel which is beautiful by the way book an Egyptair flight or just forget about it.
I flew to Las Vegas in March 2016. From Manila I had a layover in Seoul and then flew to Los Angeles. That was a 19 hour flight in total I think. I especially like their spacious legroom. They have excellent food quality. Korean Airs staff are all friendly and attentive to passengers needs. The only thing I didnt like was the clogged sink in the toilet. Overall I would not hesitate to fly again with them.
Heho to Yangon. The aircraft was pretty new and very clean. We have been greeted with a smile and the personnel was kind and professional. We have been served some basic breakfast that for such a short flight was appreciated. Flight on time and overall very comfortable and enjoyable experience.
This airline is a clear disappointment. Had I known I wouldnt be on a Norwegian plane where I at least know what to expect I would have changed my flight immediately. On the way to Dublin I was asked to give up my seat that I paid for by the flight attendants because the airline hadnt set room for them to sit together in the back I told them they could move me to first class where theres a window so I can sleep I had been up for 36 hours at this point and bought this seat for a specific reason which they laughed off and then denied me. Apparently that didnt sit well with them because I was ignored the rest of the flight by not being offered food or drink off of the cart blatantly raising my hand and waving at the nearest attendants who facing me happened to not see me acting as if something was on fire. I had to call over two attendants when I saw them since they also didnt want to answer my call button. One attendant told me nothing was available except a brownie gummy snacks and drinks. About 15 minutes later I grabbed another attendant who politely checked again and got me noodles so I could take my medication. Now Im returning home and this plane is disgusting. We were to board at 1.30pm and fly at 2.30pm. We boarded just after 2. I purchased priority seating because I was not going to deal with the mess of waiting and I still had to wait an extra 20 minutes in the corridor. Apparently the plane was on base last night or early morning but was stuck in a queue and couldnt move to be cleaned and sorted Im not sure but while we were in the corridor an attendant asked a maintenance man for extra toiletries for the flight as there werent any. Now I get to my seat and theres crumbs all over on the floor and I get it. Flights back to back but when the plane has been on base for this many hours its unacceptable. I look to my right and theres nothing but trash napkins what looks like a McFlurry lid food etc. just in this one area. I have never ever flown on a plane so gross and useless. I wish I were able to give 010 for everything except entertainment which works surprisingly and sodaswatertea thats average everywhere.
There are no actual live people to take care of any issue. We went in person to the airport to claim our property and no one available. They have a third party company for their check in and even they dont know any Iberia managers or employees. We apparently have to come to the airport and hunt them down maybe around 3 to 4 to get back our luggage. Unheard of to actually be able to contact someone on the phone. Please stay clear of Iberia.
Pleasant journey with Akasa. Their cabin service is good and travel was on time. They crew did a decent job of keeping everyone comfortable. Will recommend others to try.
Tbilisi to Kuala Lumpur via Baku Doha. The staff both onboard and ground staff were very helpful and nice. I had very short connection in Doha just 45 minutes and the staff was very helpful. Despite this short connection everything went really smoothly we didnt even have to run in Doha airport and when we arrived at the gate the ground staff even thanked us for making to the gate on time. I never enjoy the food during flights but Qatar served unexpectedly high quality food. I felt like I was having dinner in the high quality restaurant. The meal was very tasty.
London Heathrow New York JFK BA115 First seat 1K. It was very strange to be bussed to the aircraft rather than using an airbridge but this was due to capacity issues. I was greeted at the steps of the aircraft taken to my seat handed pyjamas and a wash bag and a glass of champagne. The seat was the new First with upgraded Panasonic entertainment system I was addressed by name throughout the flight given extra food to try as it was a half full cabin regular top ups for drinks and received a stellar service from a dedicated and professional crew. The new entertainment system was great and the buy for you fly service worked as my items were delivered to my seat. One of the best flights Ive had for a long time but I always believe its down to the service.
I am writing to thank Qatar Airways for exceptional service during my flight from Washington to Kathmanda via Doha. All flight attendants were welcoming warm and professional during both of my flights and provided firstclass service. I have to say that Qatar Airways are simply the best airline in the world. Thank you very much.
Excellent service and so kind and nice and polite staff Two person in specific Mr. Mannan and Ms. Shirin on flight QR 1380 on 1st February were excellent and were very polite and very supportive. Excellent service provided.
Sydney to London via Hong Kong. We found the check in staff and cabin crew nowhere near as friendly as other airlines we flew in Business Class. Business Class meals are very poor quality and selection they seem to cater for more Asian people in the meals so in future we will use other airlines. Even their inflight entertainment selection is inferior to others only good thing is the aircraft comfort. I will add a photo of the meal choices for the London to Hong Kong section. We flew from Sydney to London return and all the Business Class meals were below standard many times only on plastic trays compared to other airlines who serve from a trolley. We wont fly with Cathay again other airlines for Business Class are far superior.
This is the worst airline I have ever flown. We booked roundtrip direct flights to Mauritius to and from Nairobi for our honeymoon. We planned to spend 7 days in Mauritius. The night before our flight from Nairobi to Mauritius I was emailed yes emailed at 11.19pm while I was sleeping to inform me that our flight time was to be changed from 1.00pm to 7.30am. As I was understandably sleeping at the time I did not review this message until I woke up at 5.30am that morning. I was staying in Naivasha Kenya at the time and so did not have time to make it to the airport. We immediately called due to the fact that we were going to miss our flight and no one was able to explain to us why this change was made so last minute to the flight schedule and why we were not informed ahead of time. I would think it would be common sense that an email in the middle of the night 8 hours prior to the new proposed flight time for a now 7.30am flight is insufficient notice. Even after speaking to multiple different Kenya Airways employees I was never given a reason for the flight time change just operations. Ultimately we were rebooked for a flight late that day but this was an indirect flight through Dubai which didnt leave until 5.10pm and involved 16 hours of travel instead of what was supposed to be a 4 hour and 20 minute flight. Because of this we were unable to check in for our hotel that we had paid for the night of our arrival and instead arrived the next morning exhausted having been traveling all night and transferring in Dubai in the middle of the night. To boot the behaviour of the passengers on the plane from Nairobi to Dubai was absurd. People were constantly standing up on the plane and blocking the aisle even after being asked to sit down by flight attendants. Kids were running around unrestrained and flight attendants had to ask over the intercom for parents to restrain their children multiple times. In the row in front of me someone was watching a movie on a tablet with nonstop gunfire with the volume on max and he was not using headphones. To top it all off in addition to missing our first night of the trip Kenya Airways also changed our return flight time moving it up from 7.10pm to 1.40pm. This effectively compromised two different days of our trip as we were unable to do much the morning of our departure and were unable to take advantage of the late checkout that we were qualified for at our hotel. On top of it all our return flight was ultimately delayed by 40 minutes and the process to check in our bags took an absurdly long time longer than it has ever taken for any other flight I have been on. We had all of our documents and it still took us 10 minutes to complete the check in process and this was after standing in line for one hour waiting for the check in desk. Bottom line if you can avoid it do not fly on Kenya Airways. You will absolutely regret it. We contacted customer service multiple times and they have absolutely refused to make amends or compensate us in any way for destroying our honeymoon.
Cusco to Lima. They canceled the flight without any notice. We found out when we arrived to the airport by 2 uninformed employees who couldnt tell us when and if we would have had an alternative flight. We had to go to Lima because the day after we would have come back to Europe thus we bought 2 more tickets by own with LATAM at the cost of 450 us in addition to the 180us already spent with Sky airline. The companyemployees told us we could only ask for a refund in Lima. When we arrived in Lima the clerk dumped us and left us the call center number. A Peruvian number that if you dont have a local mobile is difficult to contact. The centralist told me that I had the right to a refund and that it would be arrived within 15 days. I really want to see whatll happen. For now we just felt cheated.
Liverpool to Bucharest. Dont use Blue Air as you cant get a refund. We have been trying since June. Emails are not replied to and there is no way to contact any one by phone. The voucher given is unusable.
Recent plane friendly staff convenient departure from Paris T3. Low cost company but fair price. Baggage allowance 20 kg is a bit short when travelling to Iceland in winter with mountain shoes ice grips.
We booked as a family our annual leave to our home country on 1st July and they provided A380 where it was fully booked the boarding process took them long time leaving passengers in the middle of nowhere even families with small kids like our family we were suffering without any help from anyone of the airline. During airport procedures I was injured with a small finger cut so once we are in the air after switching off seat belts sign I pinched the attendant button and for 40 min no one came to the limit I went to attendants place to request band aid. I have a boy and a girl where one got served with kids food and the other not for 30 min till I stood up again and requested for the food and the answer I was provided that sorry the oven is broke. I had to take the same airline traveling back to Dubai for some work and I hoped to have a different experience once I approached the check in counter I was informed that the flight is delayed with 105 min and the flight took off Delayed more with 150 min. I wrote to customer service to compensate such loss who took them 2 days to reply my complain explaining how they are aiming for best customer service and trying to be number 1 and by the end they told me nothing and no compensation. I still have 2 flights already booked with them and really this will be the last time I will think flying with such bad attitude and service.
First off its not that cheap really our flight departure and return destination was changed to a different inconvenient airport at a different inconvenient time. EU regulations imply that a refund or a free change should be offered but that wont appear anywhere in the email they send you which essentially reads it is what it is suck it up. Thirdly and the true cherry on top some of the reserved seats we bought in order to travel together had to be bought again as the child in our party was moved far from her parents for no good reason at all once the departure airport was changed. There is no customer support. Two requests to at least reimburse the same seats we had to needlessly buy for a second time and not cheaply were systematically ignored. Ludicrous they shouldnt be allowed to operate. Basically TAROM flies to all BlueAir destinations and these days their fares are comparable and when you add up all the inconveniences not only will you be happier with TAROM but also quite likely with more cash in your wallet. Avoid like the plague.
Barcelona to Bangkok via Tehran. Cabin attendant spills by accident a cup of coffee over my legs causing me minor burns and stains on my trousers and shirt. Purser writes a report and apologized. This caused great inconvenience because It happened on the first leg of the flight and could not change until arrival in Bangkok where I had a business meeting. I made a formal complain to Mahan Air customer services and do not even answer. They should compensate this inconvenience. Terrible customer service that do not answer any complains.
Mauritius to Dublin via Istanbul. I have flown Turkish Airlines a few times now in business. The business seats are side by side lie flats and not the more modern individual spaces found on most longhaul airlines. So privacy is an issue. The chef in my opinion not a professionally trained chef but more a steward. The idea is a not a bad one as it gives the impression of a more dedicated service. However the food is quite poor and the drinks offered not a large selection. The staff were all very pleasant to me. Arriving at IST the business lounge supposedly the best in the world was closing. I arrived at 12.10 and the girl told me they were closed. I wrote to Turkish and after a large exchange of emails I gave up. They insisted it was open. I was there it was closed Their website is a mess their mobile site a disaster and their customer service appalling. They destroyed my new bag. I got the replacement quote and they offered me half. Why should they ask me to pay half towards a bag they wrecked This has changed my attitude towards Turkish and they are not my chosen airline any longer.
PragueCologne May 1 on brand new A319. Flight departed and arrived on time very clean cabin spacious legroom and comfortable seat. I paid smart price which include a sandwichsmall bottle waterone time juice or soft drink service cabin crew friendly and efficient. Will fly with 4U again definitely.
Guadalajara to Chicago . Do not fly with them just cause its cheaper. They make up for it by getting you with every little thing while you are about to board. Worse experience ever. Will never be using them again.
Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City. It seems a shame that Vietnam Airlines continues to shoot itself in the foot instead of improving. My trip from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City was afflicted by the same problems as in past 6 years. The safety announcement prior to take off was almost inaudible and beyond comprehension. I brought this to the attention of the senior cabin attendant in economy who didnt seem concerned. Even the video presentation had errors with the actor in the lifevest demonstration blowing across the inflation tubes not into them. The food served about an hour after departure was okay not special. Soon after the trays were cleared away we entered an area of quite strong turbulence. The seat belt sign was illuminated and an almost inaudible message alerted passengers but then the sign stayed on for almost 3 hours after the turbulence had ceased. Naturally passengers ignored the sign and went about the cabin and to the toilets with no concern from the cabin attendants. As has been the case for years the inflight entertainment leaves a lot to be desired especially when compared to similar carriers. Choices are extremely limited while the secondary control on the top of the seat armrest repeatedly changes the volume turns your reading light on or calls the cabin attendant if your rest your arm on it. A serious design error approved by Vietnam Airlines. The prelanding snack was a beef pie. Mine was cold and I asked the senior attendant for a hot one. She said nothing took the tray and disappeared. Soon after the food server in the other aisle saw that I had no meal and gave me a hot pie. After another 5 minutes the senior came back with my original pie. Is this the best VNA can do with cabin service Oh and like every VNA flight Ive taken in the past 6 years the unsmiling cabin crew seem to regard their job as boring and a grudging effort. VNA has the potential to be among the top international carriers in the world but it will take a total attitude turnaround of senior management to achieve this.
Open Skies makes the waiting and boarding process very relaxed. In Newark we were treated to the British Airways Lounge as we were flying BizBed to Paris. Security was even easier with all the little perks you get by flying this boutique airline. The bed was okay but the configuration of the BizBed cabin was atrocious. Once everyone reclines their bed you can not get out if you in the window seat. Each bed unfolds to the edge of the seat in front and in back of them. Coming home we were in the BizSeat cabin. Orly Airport was excellent. Security was set up so you bypass the masses and enter through a private line. The lounge was quite comfortable and extremely relaxing. For the comparative price to business classfirst class on other airlines this is a great bargain.
Cathay Pacific premium economy is it worth it The answer is only if the airplane is new. We flew from Hong Kong to Vancouver and aside from service and food the seats were just a tad bigger than economy seats. On the return it was really like flying economy with the seat configuration being 242. Seat pitch was narrow and cramped. The only time we felt we were on premium economy was the Manila to Hong Kong leg of the trip because we had flown with a new plane and seats was noticeably wider. However meal was like economy a boxed juice and a boxed sandwich. Its a good thing we paid the promo price. Unless you are assured of flying the new planes I do not see any difference flying premium Eco as compared to economy except for a better service than economy.
I book a ticket for another person when I reviewed the ticket 15 min after it was issued I realized that the 1st name was missspelled. 2 extra keyboard keys were pushed inadvertently. I contacted Turkish airlines customer service they will not talk to me until i filled out their feedback form and got a case number which I did. including attaching a copy of the passport to correct the name. Then I called back the agent gave her the case number she transferred it to ticketing department. Instead if the name being corrected i got the following email Dear D G The travel date and passenger details on our web sites are being chosen by our passengers through calendars and those dates are being shown again on the availability screen the flight information and payment screens time of flight route airport and date of travel. On the other hand the section I Agree to be bound by the rules of Terms Conditions General Conditions of Carriage on Turkish Airlines web site and fare notes of the ticket reserved and I confirm the accuracy of the information I entered. is being shown to passengers on the paymentconfirmation page prior to completing the ticketing transaction. A confirmation email is being sent to passengers upon completing the transaction. After the ticket is purchased the general rules of the related ticket apply and all transactions such as changes or refunds are being performed according to those rules.

Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
They deserve to be called Asias favourite boutique airline. Everything about flying Bangkok Airways was a pleasure. From efficient checkin to friendly staff on the ground and in the air. But most importantly the comfort of the business class seats. They are from an era in aviation when comfort was king. Okay so there was no inseat entertainment screen but who still needs those anyway
London to St Petersburgh flight left on time aircraft was clean. The flight was not full and we were given aisle and window seat with a vacant seat in the middle. This was similar to the business class section. Hot breakfast was served. Overall a comfortable short flight. My only gripe was slow check in at Heathrow T5 as all pax to Russia have to have their Visa checked by supervisor. British Airways Ranking
Cost cutting to the max. The inflight service has now reached the bottom. No more choice of meals just a mini portion of salad cheese pasta without salt or pepper. A mini sandwich as a second meal during a 9h flight.
No problems at the airport in Vienna it was easy to find the British Airways check in desk. The flight was on time. The cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasant. I also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread and it was very delicious. The only problem was at Heathrow because the gate bridge had a malfunction so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraft. But it is not an airliner mistake. After all I enjoyed the flight with British Airways.
London Heathrow to Toronto with British Airways. After experiencing the modern T5 we boarded our flight on time and got sat down. We were in an older 777200 so the seats werent very comfortable due to the material and the entertainment screen was small. We departed late as they had to unload bags they also had to reset the entertainment system. In the air we were offered beverages. Later in the flight the meal service. There was chicken curry I had it it was nice but the rice was a bit dry and a pinklooking coleslaw as a side salad. The dessert was a butterscotchchocolate mousse which was good. The other alternative was a pasta. I watched some films there was a good range and I like how the BBC News is up to date so I could catch up with the current affairs. The crew were not overly friendly but kept servicing us with extra drinks. I had a nap and then we were served a small landing snack. The much rumoured Mars Bar is actually true as well as some Belgian chocolate cookies and other small snacks. We landed on time but had to stay on the plane until the immigration hallway became a bit clearer.
First time on Nok Air as normally take Airasia for domestic travel in Thailand. Checkin was nightmare as they did not have my prereserved seat in the emergency exit and tried to charge me 300THB despite the fact I already paid this. Boarding from a remote stand through buses unlike other airline using an airbridge. Aircraft was tired an ex Ryanair Boeing 737. Seat was uncomfortable and not a patch on AirAsia. You do get a complimentary cup cake as a snack. I will be using AirAsia for future domestic travel in Thailand.
Paris to Berlin. Surprisingly decent for what you pay for. I was pleased with the service onboard and the comfort of the seat. A nice touch to receive complementary tea and coffee after waking up midday.
Bangkok to Toronto via Hong Kong. Catering was better from my previous trips with the airline. However on the Hong Kong to Toronto sector the second meal service was served midflight instead of prior to arrival. Cabin crew were pleasant on both flights with a positive attitude. Drinks came about every hour or so on the Hong Kong to Toronto sector and the galley was stocked with drinks and snacks. Both flights departed on time and arrived their respective destinations ahead of schedule. Although my recent experiences with the airline have been relatively inconsistent see my previous reviews I would choose Cathay over competitors at the same price point.
Jetstar is perhaps my least favorite among other low cost airlines operating in Singapore but they offered a good option to fly from Osaka to Singapore via Manila so we make the booking. Fast and efficient checkin Japanese style in Osaka airport 4 hours of flight to Manila and then another 3 or so to Singapore. Nothing special typical budget airline flight no entertainment system foodtobuy drinkstobuy. But compared to the low fare it was just good enough. Basically its better to book them on shorter flights.
Sharm El Sheikh to Birmingham. Myself and my partner were caught up in the security situation in Egypt following the bombing of the Russian Aircraft. Monarch had my mobile number but unfortunately my mobile decided that it would stop working in Egypt. My daughter in the UK had to contact them and give them an alternative number so that they could contact me regarding our flight home. I received a call on Saturday 14th November informing me that our flight home would be leaving the following day and that it would be to Birmingham and not Manchester. We were met at Sharm airport by a number of polite and helpful Monarch Airways staff and were airborne almost on time. The Captain and crew were marvellous and the complimentary meal we were given on board was greatly appreciated. On arrival at Birmingham we were met once again by a number of very understanding Monarch Airways staff who surprised us all by giving us a free bag containing a loaf milk and a packet of biscuits. Whoever thought of this little gift should be complimented as at almost midnight on a Sunday night this was a very welcome gift. I can only give them the highest praise for the way that they looked after us.
A 50minute flight from Riga to Tallinn on a Dash 8 bombardier plane in excellent condition as well as the comfort of the seats. The staff during the flight was a bit absent moreover I recommend this company for its efficiency and punctuality.
Munich to Manila via Kuwait. Worst airline ever Once arriving in Kuwait from Germany we found out that the flight was delayed by three hours. We asked what our rights are since we will miss our connection flight in Manila. They said no rights since its not booked all on one ticket under their name. They said sorry but moved on. We than booked a new ticket for 100 each. Unbelievable this service. After a longer discussion we were offered a hotel since our normally 5 hours stopover would have been 8. we were picked up at the hotel 1.5 hours before the new departure time. At the Airport we were waiting again until the newly scheduled time passed again. No announcement nothing. Hundreds of people waiting without news. Than they suddenly announced again a delay of 2 hours. Our newly bought connection ticket expired again. They said we are sorry but thats the rules and regulations. Unbelievable really they said to book again on our costs and than again they delayed it and we had to book a second time on our costs. We got offered nothing. When we complained they were so rude to us. And we should be quiet if we dont want trouble with airport security. This was definitely my last flight with them. Shame on you Kuwait Airways.
After searching flights across different airlines I found the price for air travel with Lynx not to be of much more of a value to fly with them vs WestJet. For 30 more I know we would be getting better on plane entertainment comfort seating and a more reputable airlines. I found the charges for seating to be competitive but for 1st bags checked is where they make up . Cant really see the advantage of flying Lynx although they seem to be owned by WestJet.
The standard of Qatar Airways has dropped. On this trip I enjoyed the older 777 layout and entertainment system over the so called state of the art 7878 which had hard seats that hurt my shoulder with very little privacy. The entertainment system on the outbound flight was ok but on the 787 was very difficult to operate. Food on both flights was less than average the encrusted chicken tasted awful and even worse was my choice of appetizer on the return flight the Arabic Mezze which I missed was dropped by the cabin attendant and it was the last one. I had to miss that and even the ice cream was out I just did not know what I had paid for.
Allegiant is the absolute worst airline. My boarding pass said to to board at 7.20 am and to be there 2 hours prior. Showed up on time waited for over an hour and no Allegiant employee ever showed up to check myself and my bags in. This is unacceptable This was supposed to be a surprise birthday trip for my elderly grandmother and this companies lack of compassion for its clientele has ruined it This is a weekend I will never get back
Los Angeles to Rome via London with British Airways. Our flight from LAX to Rome was on time and generally good. We upgraded from Economy to Premium Economy at the airport for 382 each. We had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer points but could not because we booked through Costco Costco said we needed to go thru BA and BA said we had to go thru Costco. Boarding was not well organized. Our flight from London was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing. One BA associate told us it would probably leave from gate 18 which proved to be incorrect information. We finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her iPad. We had to sprint back to gate 1 with 15 minutes until departure. When we arrived at that gate we were told we would be bussed to our gate. We waited another 25 minutes for buses. Seats were fairly comfortable. Food was just okay the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rock. We arrived in Rome almost 2 hours late. Coming home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good value. Our flight from Rome to London was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from Rome. Boarding was chaotic and you couldnt understand the announcements being made about who was to board and when. Other people were turned back rather rudely by BA staff. Everyone seemed confused. Snack on board was small but tasty. We had to be express serviced through security in London in order to catch our connecting flight. No time to catch a snack or use the toilet. Boarding was inprocess when we arrived at the gate. Then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off. Seats were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat the back of the seat was very close to your face. You had to go horizontalin order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room. Arm rests between seats and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rests. Food was pretty good. On board entertainment was good. Service was slow forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you. Our luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in London. We arrived 25 minutes late to LAX. I also take exception to the 90 luggage charge per leg of the trip for our 2nd bag. 1st bag is no charge but 380 round trip charge for the 2nd bag is very steep.
Hong Kong to Bangkok. My original flight was delayed due to terrible weather. The ground staff was very efficient and arrangement to an earlier flight very quickly though I have no time to enjoy the business class lounge. The food was quite okay not good not bad. IFE was awesome and the new long haul business class seats was a flat bed and it had so much leg room.
Frankfurt to Ljubljana. Flight was very comfortable professional crew. The monitors above passengers provide informations about flight speed altitude temperature time to landing etc.
SOFCDG. Spotless E190 aircraft. I find its 2x2 layout very comfortable with leather seats. Departure slightly late but arrival on time. A sandwich for breakfast and a drink which is pretty standard nowadays. I would say it is 3star standard.
LHRMAD with BA462 on a Boeing 767300ER. Very full flight but it didnt stop the crew from delivering superb customer service Drinks and sandwich offered 30 minutes after take off. Second round of drinks offered. Very cheerful crew helpful and friendly. Pilot personally came out to greet passengers on our way out. Very smooth take off. Landing could be better. Would definitely fly with British Airways again
The airline canceled my flight five minutes after I was asked to check in. 24 hours prior to supposed departure. They were unreachable via email or phone after waiting online for over an hour. Anyone who rates this airline over terrible has to be related to someone that owns the company because they are the worst.
Our flight from Kabul to Dubai on the weekend was delayed because Safi Airways hadnt paid its fuel bill.
Los Angeles to Bangkok via Beijing. The worst business class flight of any airline hands down just cheap. Just attempt to reach them by phone. Well the phrase rings true You get what you pay for. At any cost of savings absolutely not worth it save yourself the trouble.
Dalaman to Manchester on A320. The seats were cramped with very little legroom. The sandwiches which were offered at an astronomic price ran out half way though service so the remaining passengers had to make do with crisps and sweets at teatime. If you didnt pay by euro the exchange rate was extortionate. Never again.
My husband and I were on our honeymoon returning from Santorini to Athens with the same luggage we carried when we flew into Santorini. When we booked our flights we paid for extra baggage and weight just to get to the boarding gate and be told that my carryon suitcase was too big. I have a universal standard size carryon. Although these fees were paid upfront when booking we had to pay an additional 50 euros to check in a carryon at the boarding gate. The gate agent was very rude and had no sympathy or tried looking at our reservation to see everything we initially paid for. This company does not abide by its own bag policy and some people were let on the plane with the same size carryon that I had. Its very contradicting that I was able to fly into Santorini without being charged for my carryon but returning hit with a baggage fee. Literally almost everyone boarding the flight ended up paying the extra fees. There has to be some type of commission these gate agents are getting because Ive never experienced anything like this from all airlines Ive flown on.
Boarding in a slaughterhouse queue in terminal 2 chaotic boarding almost at a standstill at the front door of the plane impassable corridor no agility. In my seat was a lady who took the liberty of sitting there and pretended not to know her seat so that she could sit next to what I assume was her companion. When the flight attendant was called she soon revealed her seat but now the aisle was jammed and it was impossible to go to the front so I sat in the seat that was possible next to an individual who spent the whole flight bothering me and despite having a vacant seat by the window.
Great fares. Excellent ground staff who calls you to let you know gate is closing. Awesome polite cabin crew. Comfortable seats. Excellent service. Good food.
Buenos Aires to Miami with LAN Airlines. On time departure and arrival. Excellent cabin staff very good service and very good food and drink. No complaints. Will fly LAN whenver I can. Cabin clean good individual screens and movies music. Airport checkin was smooth.
Prague to Moscow. One month ago I had the worst flying experience. It all became during the flight organization and checkin and continued onboard. Even though it was not the first time I used this carrier but that time they exceeded all expectations. The personnel on board was rude and ignorant. When people were inquiring on either coffee they were serving was ground coffee or instant one one of those stewardesses just answered in a way just leave me alone and the coffee is not for free. My previous trip I had with the company I had been sat by the emergency exit that is usually could be considered as an advantage that time caused me lots of trouble and the chairs were even less comfortable than I could imagine. Just after that flight I carried over to Aeroflot and it was totally remarkable difference. Also it took a while to get our luggage from a plane. I do not recommend anybody to use that company.
Good experience done web checkin and traveling without checking baggage so no check in experience boarding was smooth. In flight service was good and so was food. Aircraft looks clean and hygienic.
London to Malaga. A terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude. At the checking at Gatwick airport I was told the flight might well be delayed of 2h as not departed yet from Malaga. SMS confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status. At Gatwick there are no arrivaldeparture boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online. When asked the BA guy at the lounge kiosk he said I could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are. Surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update. At the gate we were told the aircraft was replaced. No apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight. We boarded at 5 pm and took off at 1815. Stiff and no recliner seats. Cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes. 6 additional seats are replacing the 2 toilets located at the back of the 320 and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is. Horrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price.
Flew Porter for the first time on their inaugural flight from YYZ to YUL. The plane was a brand new delivered in Dec 2022 Embraer E195E2 CCKQL and I was given seat 26C. Boarding started around 10 minutes late as the crew was relocating some of the passengers for balancing issues. We boarded the plane which was half empty. We took off around 45 minutes late due to a small technical issue. There was free WiFi available throughout the flight including takeoff and landing as well as one power outlet per passenger. Takeoff was smooth beverages and a snack were served and we landed with a 30 minute delay. Landing was among the smoothest I have ever experienced. The crew was really nice.
Connecting from Dubai to Chiang Mai. Domestic connections very seamless at that hour 7.30pm as there werent many domestic flights left. Lounge at Bangkok was very quiet and pleasant with a decent selection of snacks and drinks good wifi too. Boarding was done on time and very quickly as the flight wasnt too full. Cabin crew were professional and friendly. Left Bangkok 10 minutes ahead of schedule. Full meal was served although it was cold and rather underwhelming unexpected of Bangkok Air. Landed in Chiang Mai 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Only issue was that the plane was rather old and the legroom was very tight but overall a good flight.
I had purchased my air ticket on Jet Airways flight 9W610 from Kolkata to Mumbai for 15122018 more than six months ago so that I can catch an international flight from Mumbai at 1145PM on the same day. The Jet Airways flight was originally scheduled to depart Kolkata at 6PM and arrive Mumbai at 9PM. On 12 December morning I received a text message from Jet Airways that the flight 9W610 has been rescheduled due to operational reasons to leave Kolkata at 745PM and arrive Mumbai at 1040PM. As with the rescheduling it was impossible to catch the international flight at 1145PM I approached Jet Airways to change my booking to an earlier flight. They made me to pay not only the fare difference but also the cancellation charge. They told ne it is Jet Airways policy to make the customer responsible if the flight is delayed by less than two hours even if the reason of the delay is on their part in this case it was Operational Reasons. Later on I came to know recently Jet Airways is in financial trouble. So it may be an innovative business model on their part to generate extra money by rescheduling flights by just less than two hours so that they can squeeze extra money from some passengers. If couple of passengers per flight change their bookings Jet Airways can pay their staff. Think twice before you book your next Jet Airways flight.
We flew from Gatwick to Dalaman Turkey on September 19th 2014. We had prebooked our seats on the plane but found someone else in these seats and the staff were either unable to help or simply didnt want to. The staff on the trip to Dalaman were rude unhelpful and spoke almost no English. I tried to explain to one of the staff that there was no toilet roll left in the toilet but was waved away by the member of staff sitting at the front of the plane. The staff then had difficulty finding more toilet rolls for the rest of the flight. The cost of the drinks etc was extortionate and staff had almost no change to give to people who didnt have the exact amount of money to pay for their goods. On the return journey on Sept 26th the staff couldnt have been nicer and more helpful they all also spoke very good English. On the return journey we were able to sit in the seats we had purchased.
Chicago to London Heathrow on British Airways much vaunted Sleeper Service in Business Class. Be advised this service is a joke. Never mind the terrible dated seats facing one another but the BA Sleeper Service mandates you eat in their awful Biz Class lounge at ORD and then suffer no dinner service on the plane. This is a monumental con. Also imagine your worst school meal in a school cafeteria and that is what you get in the BA lounge at ORD. The food was some kind of dreadful steamed slop that you literally would not feed your dog. I used to imagine that long haul business and first class passengers were valued by transAtlantic airlines. The British Airways business class product is the worst by far. Old aircraft old seats disillusioned crew and simply the most terrible food imaginable. British Airways hold their premium class passengers in contempt. What happened to English class and manners
MAYAir is the worst airline when it comes to customer service. My flight was delayed from Fort Lauderdale to Cancun and was in constant contact with MAYAir to ensure them that I would be on time for the flight. I landed and rushed to the terminal where they fly from. Their shuttle bus took over 10 mins to arrive and therefore missed the flight to Cozumel. I arrived exactly at the time of departure and was assured by multiple MAYAir employees at the terminal that MAYAir had been told I was on my way and assured me i was able to get on the plane. When I arrived they all pretended not to know what I was talking about and therefore charged me a fee to get on the next flight. No apologies were given no tolerance no customer service and because its sunday no one to officially complain to. Aparently the supervisor had gone home. This is the second time this has happened to me. Another disturbing fact is that they charge a very high exchange rate for people paying excess luggage at 10 mexican pesos for every 1usd.
Manila to Puerto Gallera. Avoid at all costs. Ive booked three times with these jokers and every time they have cancelled the day before the flight. They claim maintenance as the reason for the cancellation but after three incidents I decided to look into it and it appears as though they are selling already sold tickets at higher lastminute rates and then cancelling passengers that booked in advance at better rates. The last time I wanted a refund they refused unless I signed a bunch of legal documents that would waive all my rights. I refused to sign and Im still waiting for a refund.
DohaBangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha appears to be the flagship among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver gold and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining champagne showers tarmac view sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year flight was full likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seatblock or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 23 weeks prior to flight what an impressive effort Preview Onboard Menu they provided 3 options all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard beers industrial and watery only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline lacks life colours and innovation though quite predictable and faultless. FAs wellrested groomed but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors quality headsets were provided to all likewise blankets pillows and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent it was easy to handle and detail on airlines homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines QR and WB frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SEAsia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who together with the airport in Bangkok saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR maybe in 2 flights of 100 and in these rare cases they have done their best to assist me.
Copenhagen to Keflavik. I recently had a very disappointing incident concerning luggage with WOW. At the gate I together with quite a number of other passengers was charged round US100 extra because my carry on case was marginally larger the the extremely small dimensions specified by WOW. As an international traveller I cant possibly have a specially small case just to suit WOW. My case is on the small side if anything and to my knowledge acceptable to all reputable airlines. Having paid the excess I was directed to go on board where of course my bag fitted perfectly into the overhead locker. No need to put it in the hold apparently. As someone who has run a business for over 40 years I know that firms that pull cheap stunts like this are well down the highway to insolvency. Customer satisfaction and their recomendations are the backbone of a successful business. What else is going on Think carefully before choosing your airline
I used Safi Airways twice over the last 2 weeks from Dubai to Kabul and back again. I used Safi Airways because it appears to be the only airline that has international safety standards certification. The aircraft were clean but I was shocked at the state of the aircraft generally. The seats were bent out of alignment in some rows. The lights above were cracked and flickered when used and the windows were badly scratched and the plastic slides and surrounds damaged. It has made me think twice about using them again. The aircraft they are using must be some 30 years old and badly need replacing.
Los Angeles to Siem Reap via Shanghai. Worst airline ever. Customer service is the worst. On July 25 we were scheduled to fly out of Los Angeles at 1230pm on China Eastern Airline flight 586 to Shanghai however the flight was delayed by two hours and we departed at 230pm. When we arrived in Shanghai on July 26 our connection flight to Siem Reap Cambodia flight number 513 had already left. The China Eastern Airline agent changed our flight and said he would give us two connection flights the first connection was to Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam then to Siem Reap. But when we arrived to Ho Chi Minh city the flight to Siem Reap was not booked by the China Eastern Agent therefore we had to buty 2 new tickets to Siem Reap. The flight delay from Los Angels to Shanghai was not our fault but the airlines and were greatly inconvenienced. This was a horrible experience. I called and went to the office. Heard nothing yet.
Absolutely terrible airline. Almost non functional website rude staff flight time was changed 20 minutes before supposed start. Avoid at any cost just fly with Philippine Airlines.
Recently flew with British Airways on Europe trip. One of our flights was delayed due to fog in London so we missed our connecting flight to Paris. Had to stand in a queue for over three hours waiting to be reallocated another flight. Only 3 staff serving 200 people. Not even water was offered to people waiting in this long queue. Awful customer service would not recommend to anyone.
Worst airline ever and I have never had such a horrific travel experience. My flight was delayed 7 hr at the start of my itinerary. I was never updated on the new departure time. I kept calling the global center 7x and they would not verify the new departure time My flight eventually left at 4am instead of 9pm but I missed all my connections and the start of my safari vacation. All my vacation plans had to be changed at last minute and this was extremely stressful. Then Ethiopian airlines lost my luggage for 7 days. No one from the airlines would help me. They kept saying they had no idea where the bag was even though I knew it was in Addis The Ethiopian website is not helpful as it is not ever updated No one contacted me so I had to spend my safari time following up. Finally after 5 days the airline said they would compensate me 100 for the lost bag...but no one at Ethiopian Global office nor in DC would assist me. I am not able to get the compensation The airlines said they can not help me and I needed to speak with their offices in South Africa This has been a nightmare experience Especially on a business class ticket. For my safari I was without clothes for half the vacation. Now I Can not get compensation. Everyone I speak to at Ethiopian airlines is extremely rude. No one will let me speak to a manager or assist me or say they are sorry. On my way home I had to fight to sit in the Ethiopian lounge. They said I could not sit in the lounge for more than 3 hr and my layover was longer. When I checked on my luggage in Johannesburg they told the lounge staff I did not have any bags checked in although I had bag tags to prove I had checked luggage my bag was missing again. I had not yet left Johannesburg. Ethiopian airlines ruined my very expensive vacation and still wont let me speak to any management about this trip I can not get anyone to respond to my compensation
I was pleased to see that British Airways now uses proper gates at Terminal 3 Heathrow compared to the previous bus boarding scrum. The boarding was organised the crew friendly and the onboard service good. We were served a tasty ham and cheese croissant with drinks the flight departed and arrived on time and bags arrived quickly. The seat wasnt very comfortable but all in all very good
Abu Dhabi to Berlin. The cabin crew in our section was unfriendly. When asked for milk for my coffee she just waved it never said a word no smiles no response in English. I had the person next to me translate. Nobody looked at passengers when we entered the plane the crew talked to each other and we were just not greeted with a smile like all other companies I have flown with. I had to make this review as it was not a good atmosphere I felt really uncomfortable and it was quite a long flight.
Frankfurt to Seattle. We rushed as fast as we could to catch our flight but security and custom lines took so much time. We arrived at our gate five minutes after checked and were told by a very rude Condor agent that we missed our flight. We asked what she could do to help us and she said nothing you will have to figure it out for yourself and then she added you might have to spend two more days in Frankfurt We texted our friends who barely got on that flight telling them that we missed our flight and they texted us back that Condor had just made an announcement that they would be 3540 minutes delayed. We cold see the plane and we knew our luggage was on the plane already because we checked it into premier checking as we had bought premier seats. Then we heard from our friends on the flight six of them that people were in our seats. That is when we figured out that Condor had already sold our seats making double money from our original flight purchase. We found another agent from Lufthansa who was opposite the Condor agent we dealt with. She was very helpful. When she called the agent we first dealt with she couldnt get a response so she called another number for Condor and was able to get us tickets from Frankfurt to Las Vegas leaving a couple hours later. The problem is we live in Seattle so we not only had to buy new Condor tickets to Las Vegas for 659.99 but we had to buy tickets from Las Vegas to Seattle on Alaska for 436.60 a total of 1096.59. Condor made a huge profit from our initial return ticket purchase of 1309.98 by not only taking our money but then selling our first return ticket to someone else. They refused to help us get home so we had to buy another ticket from Condor 659.99 and that only took us to Las Vegas. We had to spend an additional 436.60 for Alaska tickets to fly from Las Vegas to Seattle. The irony of this whole story is the plane that we missed was delayed an entire hour at Frankfurt. It would have been so easy to have let us on board since we were just five minutes late. They had to take our luggage off the plane and transfer to our new flight. What a waste of time and energy.
On December 1st my flight from Istanbul to Miami was delayed nearly 3hours which resulted in me missing a flight from Ft Lauderdale to Bozeman. I arrived at the airport Istanbul close to 3 hours early and after standing in a 45 minute line was redirected to another checkin line. Both were marked International At checkin in the second line I was informed my PCR test from November 30th was not valid same day testing was now required. Off I went to a rapid test a couple thousand feet way. 45 minutes later returned with another test and was cleared. I was told to hurry for the flight was close to boarding. Istanbul airport is beautiful but very big so I had to go through 2 security checkpoints and run for 30 minutes to get to the gate. I arrived gate D17 to find a very long line. It was now about 0110hrs. I was a little confused since we had just went through 2 pretty intense security checks to now see we were going through another one. Security was wand scanning and intensely going through carry on bags etc. Many people were agitated. Shorty after 0200 we began boarding the aircraft. We waited onboard for just over an hour with the pilot apologizing for the delays. Initially he said wed be 20min late. At about 0315 a passenger became angry over the delay and eventually was removed from the plane. Our flight started taxing at 0400. We did not arrive Miami until about 0900hrs. The inflight wifi would not work so I was delayed in calledcontacted my connecting airline until landing. They were very nice about it all but had no flights going to my destination until the following day. I cleared passport by about 10am and after spending 2 hours found one flight to Bozeman via Delta for 700 which was 2 times more than my missed flight. It also put me in 5 hours later. I contacted Turkish asking for a partial future flight credit and was told to contact customer feedback via online. After 4 messages back and forth Turkish Airlines said they would not give me any future flight credit because my ticket did not have the connecting flight attached.
A quarter of an hour before departure we got the message that the Insel Air flight was cancelled. No additional information was available. All we got is a coupon for 8 dollar and at Curacao Hato airport not a single meal could be bought. Finally after a delay of 3.5 hours we arrived at Bonaire for a flight of 25 minutes.
Yangon to Nyaung. My wife and me flew three routes with Air KBZ over our holiday in Myanmar and we got outstanding service every time. The cabin crew all have excellent presentation and are very courteous and attentive. We had a cold snack tea and coffee all of which were very tasty on all flights. Its unusual to be given cream cakes at 8.30 am but they were very nice. All aircraft used were very clean and in good condition and all flights departed and arrived exactly on time. Air KBZ is way better than we expected.
Compared to many lowcost airlines in Europe the service is much better both ground service and onboard reasonably fast boarding and none of the usual struggles with luggage that one sees with other lowcost carriers. The A220 really makes most of the difference the cabin feels more spacious and bright than A320 and B737 there is plenty of room in the overhead compartment and the seats are surprisingly comfortable at least in shorthaul flights with ample legroom and the possibility to recline the backrest. There was a decent selection of food for purchase onboard but nothing special. There is WiFI onboard but no internet so you can only access the same sort of information that you have on the onboard magazine it seems like a lost opportunity.
London to Budapest on Club Worldnow I dont even mention the fact that my luggage hasnt arrived but the price for club world is a huge rip off You can sit in the new slimline type of seatwhich is thinner than the previous ones and some genius obviously thought that if they put in thinner seats why not squeeze in another 2 extra rows which means that the leg space is less than half as it was in the old days so exactly like in economy class. So you pay 300 dollars more for 3 stale finger sandwich and a scone what a bargain Shame on you BA for the lousy service. Will never fly with them again.
The flight from Cebu to Manila started on time no proper food narrow seating. Upon arrival in Manila with only small time to spare to catch the connecting codeshareflight TK departs from Terminal 3 while PAL arrives in Terminal 2. In Manila the 4 terminals are far apart and not internally connected. Usually there is a shuttle bus by the airline to provide interterminalconnectivity. The last time I flew this route on same booking details the shuttle even circled inside the airport between terminals making security checks easy and the whole experience a breeze. Not this time. They had discontinued the shuttle and saw no responsibility in making sure that I will catch the flight. They told me to walk or pay for taxi and they would not allow me to ride on their staff bus. This was a codeshare of PAL with TK.
Really the worst experience of my life. Both of the flights in delay for almost 1 hour on board no amenities as such water. Everything must be paid. On the second flight 9 hours not one time the hostess pass with water or something. You must book the food before depart otherwise is never included in the ticket also for the long flights. Seats are poor standard uncomfortable and no recline. No any entertainment system on board it looks like came back to 1970s. I will never flight anymore with this company.
In the last two rows of the plane and four of us were trying to sleep. Two flight attendants couldnt stop talking the whole flight about skateboarding and scooters. None of us could sleep and the attendants didnt seem to care at all. Very unsatisfactory service. WestJet I should have taken your later flight.
Avoid this airline. I had 4 separate flights with Aeromexico. Each flight was delayed for hours without an explanation or something for the inconvenience. I will never fly this airline again. Horrible.
After being forced to purchase tickets via this airline for the third time I was again disappointed. 3 strikes and you get a bad review AA. First flight I had no assigned seating and flight delayed 2nd time I had my luggage missing for 24hours. Now this this 3rd time I have a delayed flight For a weekend trip that sets me back on my job and plans for my wife and I. I wish this airline would just go away so something else could take its place. You get what you pay for here but it is not always the cheapest so 210 value Ground service non existent in my case. Seat comfort is average for an average sized male. Cabin staff considering how much they hate their job not bad.
Terrible and rude staff many of the staff were untrained and the trained staff were trained only to be rude and cut throat. Dont believe the Emirates hype this airline sucks.
Seattle to Prague via London Heathrow with British Airways. Checkin took about an hour online checkin was not available. The catering onboard is the worst from all European legacy airlines. The breakfast on the long haul flight was a bad joke bread with cheese and a muesli bar. On the 2 hour flight only little chips or biscuits. I talked to the cabin crew on most of the 4 flights they encouraged me to write reviews because they do not agree with the company catering policy too. Also the performance of the crew is of a very low quality. The aircrafts were new that is of course more important that food.
I would like to thank the Pegasus team in Istanbul for the service and hard work they provide in this difficult time after Turkey suffered from the earthquake. The flight was delayed 2 hours and I missed my connecting flight. Considering the whole situation on the country and bad weather conditions I suppose that delays may happen. Pegasus provided me with another ticket free hotel stay till my next flight and food. Thank you.
I booked my flight tickets with this airline and that decision to choose SpiceJet turned out to be the nightmare First and foremost the airline added a stop Jabalpur at the last moment without seeking any consent from the traveller. I booked my flight for 8th June 2022 nonstop from Mumbai to Chennai. Had to postpone my journey as my wife is pregnant and she couldnt take a 5 hours since SpiceJet added a stop thereby routing my journey from Mumbai to Jabalpur to Chennai and making a 2 hours direct journey to a 5 hours journey. Left with no other option I had to shift my journey date to 9th June. Reached airport and there started another another round of drama. Ill mannered rude and arrogant ground staff at the counter made me stand for 30 mins and then she finally came up with a form which stated that if any things goes wrong with my pregnant wifes health the airline will not be responsible for anything including any expense incurred in health. Me my wife and my 3 year old son we all were allotted a different seat numbers. Even after requesting multiple time that lady refused to give us sequential seating arrangement. At last I had to request my fellow passengers to change the seats they were kind enough to accept my request. Highly unprofessional rude and arrogant cabin crew. I am a frequent traveler but I havent faced such incident in my past.
ANCFAIANC Economy Open Seating. Check in was difficult. The checkin agent did not understand how to read my ticket and almost seemed to blame me for the error. Once on board however the flight attendants both on the outbound and return were very nice especially on the return flight a definite sense of humor. Era offers low fares between Anchorage and Fairbanks and I will be flying with them again. Its also nice not to have to go to security when flying on the smaller planes.
Just flew from Copenhagen to Paris to Montreal on June 17th. We were behind schedule when we landed at CDG with only a small chance of making our connecting flight that day. My wife made it to the correct gate and was able to board while I ended up at the wrong gate. I would like to offer a huge thank you to Captain Emmanuel Rollier who insisted the plane would not leave until I arrived at the plane. The rest of the crew were equally supportive and helped create a positive ending to what had been a very stressful day. Thanks again to Captain and crew.
Doha to London. I have flown in Qatar business class cabin before but this is the first time I flew with the latest business class cabin in the Boeing 787. The seat is excellent with ample storage. I managed to take a nap in relatively short long haul flight. The lighting and temperature were good enough to let me taking my nap. There were a lot of options for the IFE and the quality of screen was excellent. The food was also great as always. The service from the crews from the start of journey until the end of the trip was above average. I think they deserve to be the best airline.
This should have been one review as I purchased a ticket from Georgetown through to Toronto. However on arrival in Trinidad we were told we would have to deplane and change aircraft. In any other airport it would be simple. Not in Trinidad Zero ground staff and we waited in a queue for 30 minutes and only after I asked were we advised that the boarding pass printer was down. Finally had to issue new boarding passes. Why Then go through security again and head to the gate. I had found out my seat was changed to a window from an aisle and Trinidad gate agent said no other aisles available but on boarding I saw the emergency exit was free. He lied. Flight left 20 minutes late and Captain said it was a mechanical issue but a pax boarded at departure so was it mechanical Seat cushion was nonexistent and cabin was tired and dirty. Also greeted in Y by a nasty flight attendant who started to harangue me for putting duty free in the overhead bin as it could fall out. A simple move of the bags already there fixed that potential issue. Flight attendant watched and scowled as I sorted out the bags and solved her stacking issue. So much better to give crap to customers than fix the problem 75 minutes after take off lunch arrives. I have never seen anything so gross in my life. Just serve nothing if this is the best you can do. No pre meal beverage service only done at the same time as the so called meal. After meal waited over an hour for pick up of the tray and no after dinner beverages offered. This was a nearly 6 hour flight No service for 2 hours and no warning that feature movie was going to start. Of course no request to lower blinds so couldnt see tiny overhead screens anyway. They say free entertainment but no headsets provided. Bar service 90 minutes from Toronto and later the ridiculous and old fashioned warning to turn off phones and Ipads as landing soon. Hello It doesnt matter on US or Canadian aircraft why on Caribbean Airlines To top it off took 60 minutes for bags to arrive in Toronto. I love Caribbean Airlines ad campaign in Georgetown with slogan Demand Value. Really As a customer how about demanding a smile or two Maybe crew was so miserable as they were missing Carnival
This is my first time travelling with RJ and for sure my last i called the flight attendee to help me with the chair because the head moved out totally and i couldnt fix it. He said Im coming and ignored me all the flight. And my booking was with a snack brunch and no one served any one anything. Royal Jordanian is the worst airline anyone can book. I dont recommend it at all.
New York JFK to Istanbul. Their planes are old and not comfortable and everything is very expensive in the airport plus their international fares are expensive. Basically they rip you off because they try to cover the new airport expenses. l would not recommend to anyone.
Vancouver to Cebu via Seoul. Weve flown with Korean air before and received services for their 12 hour layover in Incheon without issue. We paid more to book with them this time and now theyre refusing to honour the layover service due to a block out period. We wouldve never booked a flight that has a 12hr layover knowing that there wouldnt be a layover service. When I tried to call they half listened and kept repeating no. I would never recommend flying with Korean Air anymore. Its really not worth it to pay more to have such a long layover when other airlines have cheaper flights with much shorter layovers. Initially they told us that they offered the services to offset the long layover in comparison to other airlines but now theyve reneged on that theres no benefit to flying with them anymore. If they wouldve been even a bit more polite and accommodating to our concerns I wouldnt be writing this review but when I asked them what they would recommend us to do on our 12 hour layover they said I dont know.
Perth to Kuala Lumpur. Malindo cancelled our return flight KL to Perth at short notice causing us 4 days additional hotel food and extra leave from unhappy employers who served verbal notice. Malindos response they dont care no compensation for our losses. Recommend using another airline
Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Plane was clean cool and half empty. I could stretch out on a whole line of empty seats. Polite crew. No meals served or sold on board as usual with Lion Air.
Auckland to St Petersburg via Doha. Fantastic experience. I have a severe peanut allergy which can make flying very stressful. In the past I was refused from boarding another airlines flight despite the proper paperwork and my own desire and I feared similar results with Qatar Airways but had the opposite experience. Qatar Airways had my paperwork on file had requested proper meals for me despite saying they had no nut free options and even went so far as to move my seat to an emptier row away from passengers who might consume peanuts. They were incredibly professional and made an 18hour flight more stress free than I could ever have imagined. Forever grateful.
London to Belfast. British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at checkin one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at checkin started quoting the Geneva convention that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update In summary dont trust BA with your loved ones care.
British Airways flight from London Heathrow to Glasgow. Shabby cabin lacklustre cabin crew flight deck crew whose announcements were mainly less than informative. A crew which appeared to be going through the motions with little enthusiasm and as little engagement with passengers as possible. Some time after the cabin crew had closed all of them the overhead locker above my seat fell open before the plane even moved off stand at LHR. On descent into GLA it opened again and hung open for several minutes and I was tempted to unclip and close it. I made the passenger across the aisle aware in case the bags fell out on top of him. Eventually the cabin crew member whose jump seat faced up that aisle got up and closed it. We should have been sitting upfront given our ticket class part of a longer trip but after service issues with BA and a long journey prior to this flight we couldnt be bothered pointing that out. Just another shabby experience to add to the other disappointments with regard to service and lounge provided by BA on a long return trip involving two other airlines who were streets ahead in all ways.
Los Angeles to Chiang Mai via Taipei. Excellent service from EVA Air counter and gate crew to their onboard staff. EVA Air planes are always clean and this long haul flight across the Pacific provided me with EVA Airs great onboard service. IFE meals and smiling crew members are difficult to beat. Once again they met and exceeded my expectations.
Bangkok to Rome via Kuwait. I have already flown with Kuwait Airways and I think Ill book even for this winter. New Aircraft on time friendly and competent staff both onboard and on the ground. And the Dasman Lounge in Kuwait airport is a real pleasure to spend time on coincidence. Restaurantbar fornitissimo smokingroom inside where they offer you Arabian coffee efficient wifi clean bathrooms as not seen at other airports. There are no alcoholic beverages but on long trips you have to hydrate yourself with water.
HELOSL. Checkin was rude and dismissive but otherwise the flight had very nice crew and the plane was spotless clean as well. BOB meal is cheaper on Blue1 than on SAS due to the currency and I found the quality to be rather reasonable as well. Ontime departure and arrival in Oslo. Ticket price was great as usual.
Terrible service overall. Staff were bad aircraft is old and uncomfortable one poor meal option. Flight delayed by 3 hrs on the way back. I have never seen anything worse than that in my life.
LHRCPHLHR. Business class on the way out and economy on the return trip. Flight on time on both trips staff as usual excellent both within the airport and on the planes. No inflight entertainment at all both operated by A320s whose seats were looking just a little tired. The biggest gripe I have is the food on the business flight we had some sandwiches which were bordering on being stale and on the return trip was a cold chicken wrap which was very short on imagination. Quite disappointed that the food appears to have gone downhill badly since our last flights. Come on BA these are the sorts of things which gave you a clear lead over most of your rivals.
Beirut to Colombo via Dubai. The flights were comfortable both ways and Emirates staff on board were helpful and friendly but on our way back from Colombo to Dubai we had a short layover and our first flight was delayed and then parked miles from the terminal necessitating a long bus ride and meaning that we rushed to make our connection. When we arrived at our gate we enquired if our bags would make the connection and were told that they were in the process of being transferred. Our flights was then delayed by the gate for 30 minutes leaving plenty of time for the bags to be loaded. Despite this when we arrived in Beirut we received a message to say our luggage wasnt on the plane and would arrive on the next flight eight hours later. We were told by ground staff that it could not be delivered and we would have to return to the airport to collect it. It took us almost an hour to find the Emirates office and someone who would help us. He promised that if we returned that evening to collect the bags the office would be open and Emirates staff would help us and would reimburse our taxi costs. When we got back the office was closed and locked and no one answered the phone. We tried going back three times over the course of an hour. No one was there. Eventually we got our bags but the process meant we lost almost four hours of our day and over 30 in additional taxi costs. Finally as we were leaving the airport Emirates staff called us to say that they were at baggage claim though we had already been there to get our bags and seen no sign of them. When we explained that we had already left the airport they told us to come back despite the fact that we had already lost all the money on the extra taxis not to mention our one free day back at home to prepare before going back to work. Terrible customer service from the Emirates staff in Beirut and no offer to reimburse our expenses or compensate for their mismanagement of the situation.
Sydney to Hong Kong. I spent just 20 more for premium economy compare to a basic economy ticket. Compare to economy the airline offered better seats food and service. There was a dedicated check in counter for premium passengers. Seats can recline more and the meal was more better than the economy product. Also a small amenity kit was also available. However I dont like the lighting in the 777 which makes the cabin look a bit worn out.
The last time I flew with them my return flight was canceled 1 week prior to my trip and the year before it was cancelled during my trip. The proposed option was to rebook us myself and my husband onto a Eurowings Discover flight This is outrageous as an offer as that is a lowcost flight and we booked Lufthansa. Instead of resorting to this option I decided to call and get rebooked to a United flight from a different city Newark. I called the number provided in the cancellation of my flight email from Lufthansa but the person I spoke with was a thirdparty agent and unfamiliar with their job. I had to give them step by step instructions on how to proceed and their incompetence totally screwed us up on our return. The night before my flight I could not check in as our return tickets were not being recognized. I spent hours of time with a United customer service agent. The agent eventually booked our seats assignments but when I reached the airport we could not check in We then had to go to the counter and the agent there had to fix our tickets as my husband wasnt even listed as a passenger. She told us that this was Lufthansas fault for not entering proper code data. If we hadnt had seat assignments we would have missed our flight. After flying both Lufthansa and United I can say United is better. This is shocking to me as previously Lufthansa was far superior but their standards have drastically changed. The food is bad the entertainment selection is mediocre and worse the seats are horrible The only positive is the staff was friendly. It was so uncomfortable and I am used to the trek across the ocean but this past time was unbearable. I will now do my best to avoid Lufthansa for all future flights its not worth it
Kuala Lumpur to Lahore. This is the worst airline I have ever encountered. They cancelled my flight without any notice and its been more than 1 month they still wont refund my money. Contacting customer care is useless because they never give a reply other than your issue has been forwarded to the relevant departments more than MYR 1000 and they have eaten all my money. I have no idea why such a fraudulent airline is still allowed to operate. I searched on Google for a feedback number since they are extremely efficient on email and I found more customers whose flights had been cancelled by Malindo and the airline has not reimbursed them and some flights had been cancelled 3 months ago and efficient and concerned Malindo wont give the money back.
Its always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Qsuites. Lots of privacy.
Riga to New York. Uzbekistan Airways is the worst airline ever. They are all rude starting from the customer service via mail to staff on board They dont care about customer at all and dosay whatever they like. Do not recommend. The food is okay enterteinment on board is okay but English is terrible..
At boarding we were told that our face masks could not be used to board Transavia as it had a valve design. Whilst it was only a design it was still not allowed and we had to get new facemasks. Upon boarding we were given a disinfectant tissue in a packet. I noted crumbs on the seat which indicated that the plane was not cleaned prior to us boarding. We were lucky enough to be seated at row 1 where we had good leg room. The other standard seats had very narrow leg room. We had to pay for food and drinks and the menu was similar to Transavia flights prepandemic. Only card payments are accepted no cash. Overall the short flight was OK. The flight was not that full and there was good social distance between passenger groups. A face mask without a valve or valve design is required for flights on Transavia
Worst airline ever I was returning home arrived to airport three hours early. Volaris changed the gate on us less than 20 minutes before with no text no email and the website was no showing that under flight status. The new gate was 10 minutes walking distance away from original gate. We missed our flight to talk to a clerk it was two hour wait because it was half the flight that this happened to. Their response was that they dont notify other than on the airport screens which are limited and are 32 inches. How would we know that every airline sends flights changes via text email or updates on the flight status via website. The staff is so rude they treat people horrible.
First the Direct Flight from Hyderabad on which i had booked two seats by paying extra charges to Patna was cancelled. Then the airline rebooked the flight on an indirect sector Hyd to Delhi and increasing the travel time to 6 hours from 2 hours. Then on rebooking they allotted me one seat on sector Hyd to Delhi and second on Del to Pat flight. I called then to rectify this and they booked two seats each on each flight. Then i realised that the two seats on Delhi Hyderabad route were allotted on two different rows. I called them and this time i was told that if i wand seat in same row i will be pushed to later rows. With two infants travelling with me it was to be very difficult if i got seat farther away from entrance. The Goair customer care staff went on making mistake for 4 times before i got get a aisle and middle seat in the same row although much farther way from exit Each time their call takes 20 minutes to connect the understanding of their staff is horrible and the phone connectivity is worst. Their service gives you headache stress and blood pressure rather than even the slightest convenience.
I am writing to express my profound disappointment with Aviancas handling of two of my trips. The sole purpose of booking the second trip was to utilize the credits provided as compensation for the previous disastrous experience. Avianca canceled our reservation without any prior notification or approval after we submitted a refund request to modify the final leg of our flight. They refunded a mere 387 disregarding the 1132 we had originally paid and cancelled the entire flight without approval. Furthermore the refund request email actually said rejected so we showed up to the airport thinking nothing changed from our original plans. The lack of communication regarding this refund and the cancellation of our trip is completely unacceptable. Aviancas incompetence and failure to communicate are deeply concerning. The airlines subpar customer support and inefficient processes are costing both customers and the company unnecessary time and money. This issue should have been resolved within a reasonable timeframe not after spending over five hours discussing it without resolution. In total Ive spent over 15 hrs with their support team including my first initial experience. I would advice all customers employees and investors to stay away from this terrible company.
Bad experience with special meals on board it was not possible to change them on website or app and we had normal meal but we were not able to eat anything because we are allergic to dairies. Fortunately the cabin crew tried to help with some bread and side dishes. Contacting their help 24 hours before the flight was not useful at all.
The customer service is ugly. Tried calling two weeks ago but still had problems with flight. All I get is someone in India. I thought i was flying Iberia once I looked close at ticket it was British Airways. Will never fly British Airway ever again.
I made my reservation ahead of time for my birthday trip and they canceled my flight without any form of communication I didnt get an email a call or a text message When i contacted customer service all the agent could tell me was that my flight reservation was cancelled and I dont have tickets. he couldnt tell me when it was canceled. but he tells me it was cancelled to protect our customers. Its a great thing i checked before we actually left because we would have been so embarrassed at the airport thinking we have a paid ticket reservations but clearly it was imaginary. I didnt get a chance to fly with them but i am so glad because this was horrible customer service to a first time flyer.
Shanghai to Barcelona via Hong Kong. The 1st flight was late so we barely caught the 2nd flight. I made it but my luggage didnt. They told me that they will only be able to deliver the suitcase 2 days later. I was instructed to call the airlines for the compensation. The service is terrible. They never pick up their phone calls and never respond to the emails. No one cares. It is so frustrating. My suitcase was supposed to be delivered 2 days later at 1.30 PM then in the evening then the following day in the morning. Seems like Im never going to get it back. I would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy.
I could not believe the unprofessionalism of the cabin crew on this flight. I am frequent flyer and often do 1 or 2 round trips between North and South America per year usually through Air Canada. This was my first Air Canada rouge experience and I hope to never have another like this again. I found it a little strange that the flight attendants stood at the door as passengers were boarding but they were not greeting anyone just standing and watching people board. The flight was 4.5 hours from Kelowna to Toronto and it left at midnight so passengers wanted to sleep. I was shocked when I woke up partway through to the sound of loud laughing and womens voices talking and swearing. I thought it must be passengers in a nearby row. However I glanced toward the back of the plane and saw all of the flight attendants standing together chatting with no regard for the passengers trying to sleep. Im sure the whole back half of the aircraft could hear them. Again as passengers exited the aircraft the attendants stood at the door but their attention was on each other as they continued chatting to one another and ignoring the departing guests. Ive never seen a cabin crew act this unprofessional before. I would recommend avoid booking with Air Canada rouge.
Lost our bags on the second leg of our trip from Cairo to JFK. we got 2 that found their way home but 3 are still missing and we are going on a week now with no assistance from EgyptAir. We filed a missing bag report with them on the 29th at the JFK airport and the gentleman there gave me a number to call 7183608927 that number goes to VM and the mailbox is full been that way for over 3 days now. I have spent 8 hours a day for the past 3 days trying to get someone at Egypt air to even acknowledge that they lost our bags. At one point they blamed it on another airline and denied our claim literally the only response we got was them telling us that it wasnt their responsibility. I have never in my life seem such a poorly run company in my life. When you have the bag tag info and everything is scanned and tracked how do not help find my bags
MadridMurcia return. Ive had a few flights with Air Nostrum now and find their flights reasonably enjoyable. Service pleasant and friendly from the FA coffee served and flights seem to leave on time. I was very impressed with my checkin at Murcias small terminal and which involved ticketing right through to Tokyo using Iberia and Japan Airlines connections and the whole process was seamless and efficient. Im not sure if I like travelling in CRJ 200s that Air Nostrum uses but that may be because on Air Nostrum at least I never seem to be able to get clean windows and am unable to see outside much at all. Do these aircraft ever get cleaned
The accuracy of scheduling is catastrophic out of four flights Ive taken with this airline in the past month all four of them were delayed with delays ranging from one to five hours. Only once have I been notified in advance if the previous day counts as in advance the other three times I learned about the delay while being at the airport already. It feels like theyre doing this on purpose yet they dont allow delays of more than six hours so they can avoid providing accommodation etc. Id say it is safe to fly with this company only if you dont have a connecting flight dont care too much about the time of arrival and have something to entertain yourself with at the airport otherwise its just stress and uncertainty.
Flew Doha to Kolkata. A superb inflight experience. Smooth night flight that was on schedule. Inflight staff exceedingly attentive. Excellent selection of movies from all over the world. Food and wine offerings were varied and ample. A full course dinner was served at a time of my choosing. The seat layout 121 provided not only space but privacy too. The seat had several configuration angles and were easy to use to get into a comfortable sitting position or sleep which I was able to for a couple of hours. A nice amenities bag was provided. A small disappointment was that none of the four items I selected from the inflight duty free catalog was available. I would also have liked the Indian government landing card provided on board as it would avoid some hassle before the immigration counter on arrival. On this route I would unhesitatingly fly Qatar Airways again. From aircraft ambience and sitting arrangements to quality of inflight service to punctuality and smoothness of flight they have set the standard to emulate.
TK is my preferred airline. As living on the Asian side of Istanbul I booked last flights to CDG BRU fromto SAW Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen airport. It seems that TK offering fromto SAW not the same product as fromto IST and that the SAW TK fleet are old compared to the fleet based in IST shortly not the same product. OK we had during my last flights SAWCDGSAW SAWBRUSAW a Flying Chef on board but no choice on food only Y configuration and no inflight entertainment IFE personalised screens available. The ground TGS staffs at business checkin counter at SAW airport has poor or no English knowledge and not communicating speaking at all. TK should standardize the product and service and should offer and have in all airplanes same business andor economy seats. You or your partner TGS have also a huge space of improvement by delivering as priority marked luggage. For inbound flights I had to wait 4560 minutes and luggage didnt been delivered with the first ones.
Flew Amsterdam to Dubai. Emirates has some of the laziest cabin crew in the industry. The quality of their service has been tanking for years now and whereas small details used to set a new standard most of these details are no longer offered. I have flown Emirates many times and somehow they never manage to leave on time and rarely do they make up for lost time. This flight for example landed 40 minutes past schedule. When you leave later and spend more time on board details start to matter. Like for example how long it takes before meals are served. But even as important as when the meal trays are collected. The first they try to stall for obvious reasons they used to serve 2 meals on these flights and now 1 and some crackers. The later they serve it the less obvious the difference. The second causes unnecessary annoyance. When youre in a window seat and have to wait for 1 hour and 40 minutes for them to clear the trays and you have to use the toilet youre going to start having doubts about their service. Their crew are more occupied getting to know each other and sharing party stories than being involved in the service they should offer. In the absence of alternatives like Qatar Airways youre almost forced to fly Emirates to most of the Middle East which is another annoyance. I am starting to give up hope the Emirates of the 20082013 era will ever return. They have become a very ordinary airline with nothing special to offer except a large screen which I dont even use because I prefer to sleep.
LA800 to Santiago was cancelled and passengers waiting in Auckland were requested to return to the airport on Sunday. At the hotel received at least five different notices on departure time that ranged from early morning on Sunday to late evening in random order. After more than five hours given boarding passes to Santiago despite the fact that tickets were to La Paz and told them that that was all they could do and that someone in Santiago was taking care of the following flights a lie. At Santiago regrettably things were not any better. Given boarding passes to Lima still not La Paz on a plane departing from Santiago at 10pm which meant another eight hours wait however it would not have been the main problem which was arriving into Lima too late to catch the flight to La Paz and needing to wait at the airport for the next flight in the morning this was not explained and no guidanc on sleeping or hotels. Eventually they managed to find space on the earlier flight at 8.00pm which made possible for them to connect to La Paz the same day landed on Monday at 5.30 am suitcases of course didnt. In the last six trips a member of my family flew LAN four times and the flight was either cancelled or delayed. The lack of competition means that no matter how badly passengers are treated LAN feels customers will not walk away.
Denpasar to Yogyakarta. I chose NAM Air because no other airline flew from Denpasar to Jogjakarta that evening and that would be a new experience for me. Thinking that the price of over baggage will be affordable as I read through several website in Google that the range is between 15.000 81.000 depending on the distance so I decided to check all of my suitcases. I went to the check in counter the CS was friendly enough. After showing my ID and mentioning my destination the staff weighed my bags it turned out that they are over baggage the maximum weight is 15 kg and the total weight of my bags is 30 kg. Then the customer said that the price for over baggage is 100.000 per kilogram. Therefore I needed to pay 1.5 million for those bags. Well my ticket was 1 million so I thought that the price for my over baggage didnt make any sense. Eventually I decided to check only one bag and brought the small baggage into cabin. Still I had to pay 700.000 for my baggage. Thats very expensive compared to another airlines. At that time the staff didnt accept card payment so that I had to withdraw some money from ATM machine. The check in process went smoothly except for those weird baggage policy. The flight schedule was ontime not many passengers on the plane that evening maybe only 13 of airplane were filled. No bus so the staff took us to the plane by minibus better than walking though but the other passengers must wait for the minibus since they only operated one. The plane was old the interior atmosphere was not that fresh however the flight quality as good. As soon as the passengers arrived on the place the FA distributed some candies. We also had bread and small mineral water. Its under my expectation noticing the amount of money that Ive paid for the flight. Since I was so tired after having a long flight then I just let it go and slept during the flight. The flight went smoothly though despite the plane age. I arrived ontime I also got my baggage faster less than 10 minutes after arrival. However the problem appeared the tag code in my bag was different to what I have in my ticket although they share the same name so that the staff stopped me for a while for further investigation. Another staff came and checked my bag and let me go. Still lot of people staring at me thinking that I might take somebodys suitcase. For security reasonI know that it is good to check the baggage codes but the staffs must be trained of what to do in case the same situation happens not just keep questioning or blaming the customer because of having different codes.
Myself and my daughter were flying home from 13 days overseas. While still on the first 6 hour flight. My next flight was delayed. We landed at JFK and then they completely canceled the flight. Saying we would have to wait basically 24 hours for the next flight. So I asked to be put on standby. Went an told the woman Myself and my daughter are here at the gate waiting for stand by. She told me she would call me if I could get on. She never did. I went and asked her again if we were able to get on and she said no. They are so completely rude and not friendly. I would NEVER recommend them
Qatar Airways had amazing customer service from start to finish. Ive never experienced anything like it. Qatar Airways took care of me extremely efficiently thoroughly and respectfully. Not to mention they will give you a full refund if you cancel your flight 3 hrs before no matter what I never buy the insurance so I assume I would never get back but they were just like yeah full refund no questions asked. This has been a breath of fresh air thank you.
San Diego to London. From the moment that I boarded this flight due to take off at 19.25 the crew had one interest and one only to get the cabin lights off which they duly achieved two hours later. As a consequence the service was negligent in the extreme. This was a Club World ticket so expensive and I looked forward to a decent level of service. However I wasnt offered champagne on boarding wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. I complained to BA when I got home but they werent interested and I was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes. This flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the US Mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline.
This was our first experience with Austrian Airlines and it was memorable for all of the wrong reasons. Delays missed connecting flights lost luggage rude service agents. Finally made it to our destination over 24 hours later than scheduled. Luggage is still lost and the website tracking system is absolutely no help. Quite simply we will never fly with Austrian Airlines again even if it means paying more money to a different airline or taking a longer route to get there. This was my worst experience with an airline in more than 30 years of international travel.
Horrible from the time I booked the returning flight had been delayed rerouted Im sitting in the airport right now its been over 7 hours I have 4 young children who dont understand whats going on amp. I also have a job I need to attend or Ill be forced to call off there had been a total of 4 delays just sitting here waiting to get back home. This is beyond ridiculous. I will never book with them nor recommend. I guess you get what you pay for
Osaka to Hong Kong. We bought two tickets together but we could not get two seats together when we tried several times at the autocheckin machine. We were early enough so it wasnt possible that there were no more pair seats remaining. We asked a young Peach staff he said you have to pay extra to guarantee seats together. We were amazed by this. We spoke to the duty manager a nice lady and she confirmed that autocheckin assigns seats randomly. We told her we had bought tickets together and were now checking in together and we had never come across this situation before. She of course apologised but confirmed that unfortunately we would have to pay extra for guaranteeing sitting together. Inside the aircraft was very tight and cramped.
Istanbul to Doha. The seating for a narrow body aircraft was really good and the entertainment system was barely okay. The food was awful and juice selection was terrible just apple and orange.
My flight from Kuala Lumpur to Doha was very peaceful and pleasant. The cabin crew Anushka was very polite she provided excellent and exceptional service to me and the fellow passenger throughout the flight with smile and finesse. I would like to appreciate her kindness and positivity.
Flying Garuda Indonesia on a shorthaul flight along with my wife and 8months old son in Economy Class. It was a busy Sunday afternoon in Adi Sucipto airport but the ground staff processed our check in with genuine hospitality. On board the crew welcomed us warmly engaged with my son and consistently demonstrated helpfulness and friendliness despite the flight being full both in Business and Economy Class. The snack served in Economy Class was two breads a pack of nuts and a bottle of mineral water. Garuda has added to capacity in some of its Economy Class planes making the seat pitch and leg room less narrower and for me personally less comfortable. The flight could also have been more enjoyable if Garuda added more movie selection in its inflight entertainment system. The flight departed and landed on time. We appreciated Garuda for bringing us back to Jakarta safely.
On the last 20.07.2022 I receive an email saying that my flight LH1497 on 20.07.2022 from Lisbon LIS to FrankfurtMain FRA at 0505 hours have been delayed and the new departure time is 20.07.2022 at 1150 hours. More than 6 hours delay. Because of this delay I lost a connecting flight to India and spent the night in Frankfurt at my own expense. Since then I trying to contact Lufthansa Services and upon a myriad of email exchanges I m yet to obtain my compensation.
Melbourne to Amritsar via Kuala Lumpur. This is one of the worst airlines out there in terms of getting into contact with. They have no telephone service in countries outside India so it is impossible to get into contact with them when you need help. Their AVA service on their website is completely useless. For the low price which is technically not because with all the add ons such as seat prices and bag prices all add up to be normal prices of flights with other airlines.
I have been bought to fly to Dar es Salaam via Dubai but the connection flight was cancelled. Emirates contacted me and was very apologetic offering a change to the subsequent day. Unfortunately I had to be in Tanzania on that day and so it is not convenient. Emirates then offered either to keep the ticket open for me to book again over the next two years or receive a full refund. I opted for the refund and within two days the full amount had been credited back to my credit card. Over the past few months I have had to cancel a number of flights and have battled with airlines to get refunds. It is often been difficult even to speak to the airlines and on one occasion I have obtained a refund through my credit card company. Emirates response has been exemplary they were proactive pleasant and acted immediately and it is one which other airlines should follow if they are going to stand any chance of restoring their fortunes. I have frequently used Emirates in the past and would not hesitate to do so again in the future.
As a foreign American passenger it doesnt get any worst flying with Cebu Pacific and in my honest opinion is probably the worst airline experience I have ever had in my 54 years of life. There were numerous delays unclear update status and EXTREMELY poor cabin climate control. I was literally sweating in my seat whiles waiting for the pilot to perform his preflight checks and waiting an unusually long time for the pilot to taxi onto the runway. There were no snacks unless it was paid for and from what I remember even when flying with Philippines Airline it was provided to passengers free of charge even during my previous short flight. If things dont change with Cebu Pacific they will follow the path of other bankrupt airlines.
Thoroughly workmanlike return flights Johannesburg to Cape Town. Cabin crew were efficient and personable. Seats 1AC had adequate leg room. Food was adequate and it was helpful to see the three main courses before choosing one. Both flights arrived ahead of schedule.
Manchester to Varadero Cuba. Never used this airline before but had no reason to think it would be any different to the many long haul flights we have taken over the years. Wrong We had no idea we were flying with a long haul version of Ryanair. Nice clean plane decent amount of leg room with rather uncomfortable seats. We had had to pay 25 each way to choose our seats or risk the real possibility of having to sit separately on a 10 hour flight which had already added 100 to the cost of holiday. The overhead lockers are quite small and the baggage allowance is a measly 20kg hold and 6kg hand luggage which is strictly adhered to. On the return journey we were 1.2kg overweight and were charged 20 by the completely inflexible ground staff no receipt given and cash only payment. Have been overweight by this trivial amount several times on other airlines but have never ever been charged Disgusting daylight robbery. On board we got settled in and once in the air the drinks trolley came. We were charged 2.80 for a cup of tea I thought it was a joke but everything was to pay for at 10 times the cost of the supermarket 1.30 for a kit kat The only free drinks were a bottle of water on the outbound flight none on the return and the tea with the two meals which was half the size of the one you had to buy. We also got a complimentary cornetto on the outbound flight which was so small it was gone in two bites. The out meals were quite nice coming back the breakfast consisted of a yoghurt and a cake Who eats cake for breakfast Turns out we do because we are starving The headsets were free but poor quality the entertainment was rubbish uless you wanted to pay an extra 5 for a better choice of films etc. The cabin crew were pleasant enough if a little disinterested. Overall not a pleasant flight and not only will we never use this airline again we would not recommend it either.
Was looking forward to the privacy and comfort of my flight from Bangkok to Doha on the A380. But what a disappointment upon checking in at BKK airport. Qatar has three flights to Doha in the evening. One flight was cancelled one delayed by 3 hours and my flight downsized from A380 to 777. Needless to say that my prebooked seat was gone and I had to endure with a leftover seat for the next 7 hours. Flight was 100 full due to the other cancelled flight. 777 not nearly as comfortable as the A380 in terms of space comfort noise and dryness of the air. Service was average and rushed. Lounge at Doha airport very crowded as always during peak hours. I left after a while because lines even for the toilets were building up. They should really consider getting another lounge. Flight from Doha to Helsinki was much better on the smaller and reasonably comfortable B788. Overall one flight below average and the other good.
It has been a terrible experience starting from the moment we started boarding in Amsterdam airport to the moment we reach Beirut airport. Where we knew that none of our 8 luggage were in the airplane. Our vacation is about to reach its end and the airlines still trying to locate our luggage. We had no satisfactory answer from them for where are our stuff and when we can receive them if we are going to.
Beijing to Sydney via Hong Kong. Late aircraft uncertain which gate to go to. Staff were useless at best not willing to do anything to help the lateness or provide any extras on board despite them causing me massive inconvenience. Terrible airline and lacks total empathy and customer service.
My son is flying to his dads today and I couldnt find his flight. I called Sun Country Airlines on a holiday weekend hoping for help and boy did I get it. Katie was absolutely phenomenal dont ever lose her. Not only was she efficient and informative but she helped calm my nervous mom brain down. Katie thank you so much for making this a seamless and easy process you are amazing.
It was the first and last time I fly with this disgusting company. The seats were completely uncomfortable and there was not enough space for legs. The tablet was only working with limited functions. If you want to see a movie or to listen to music you would had to pay extra. There was nothing included in the price of the ticket I asked for 1 glass of still water and they told me they did not have it and asked me to pay extra. The staff was unprofessional and ineffective. There was a small delay about 1520 minutes but this was the most insignificant issue. The crew did not apologize for the delay. Very expensive for this poor quality
I recently had a flight from Sydney to New Delhi with a 1 hour 15 minute layover in Kuala Lumpur. Apprehensive about the layover I called Air Asia customer care to check what happens if I miss my flight and I was assured that if the first flight is delayed the connecting will also be delayed and I will not miss my flight to New Delhi. But I did miss my flight thanks to an hour long delay in Sydney. I was then asked to either stay at the airport for 5 days I didnt have a Malaysian visa since it was transit only or fly to another city in India and of course I picked the latter. But then I had to book another flight for myself early in the morning at for 2am to get to my home city with exorbitant charges. They refused to compensate in any way.
This was my first experience flying Finnair and it was great. The flight was originally booked on Lufthansa however the aircraft was from Finnair and the crew from Eurowings. I paid to upgrade to Premium Economy however the aircraft did not have a Premium Economy designated area so they moved me to a Business Class seat the meal and service was of Premium Economy however I was thrilled to receive the seat upgrade. The crew was pleasant and very efficient and this 8 hour flight was indeed perfect.
Gatwick to Riga. Comfortable plane and excellent take off and landing. But cabin service was extremely poor attendants simply failed to offer any food or beverage. Could not understand announcements in English. And airbaltic is the first airline Ive ever known not to offer free water to customers. Absolutely shocking.
Great thing about British Airways A380 is the economy section upstairs. Get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very old the A380 looked tired inside. Broken side stowage a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFE. The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same. Asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box. Staff were ok. Couple decent but mostly just ok. Overall BA just seems a tad cheap these days. Great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended. Just seemed a bit dull and like BA are just an average airline.
Denpasar to Jakarta. Garuda seem to always impress from the ground crew to the air crew. Was great to fly a widebody aircraft on a regional flight thus giving lots of legroom and space in between seats. Food service was fast and prompt serving chicken rice coconut jelly and a bottle of tea and water. Entertainment was fine for a short flight. The only down side was waiting for my bag in Jakarta but seems to be normal with any airline flying to Jakarta
Outward journey BA245 London to Buenos Aires Club World 10 January 2023. Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged. One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related. My soup was cold I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a selection of rollspastries but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry where he would have chosen a bread roll. Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast from the warm welcome on boarding to crews professionalism throughout. Its a poor reflection on Club World service that our experience in World Traveller Plus was so much better and kinder. Weighed against the advantages of a flat bed the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above.
Moscow to Los Angeles. The airline did not allow me to select seats for my upcoming flight but offers an option to reserve 24 hours in advance. I was flying with a family member who was able to select their seat without a problem. When it was my turn to do the same we did it at the same time from the same computer the system would not allow me to do it. After checking the info we decided to call their customer service. The associate did not offer help. After admitting that all of our info is entered correctly they told us that we need to use a different version of their software. No resolution was offered myself and my family member flew in different ends of the plane.
I booked tickets online with Qantas in February 2022. It was for myself my husband and 4 children under the age of 10. For some reason whilst booking there was no option to select a childs airfare. It was basically impossible to contact Qantas. I called and was on hold for over an hour and then got hung up on and another time was told by a recorded message to call back later and was disconnected. We needed to book our tickets so I booked them and continued to try contacting Qantas. Eventually after being on hold for almost 2 hours I got through to someone. I explained the situation to them and they changed the booking to show that this was for 4 children. There was a difference in price so they said I would be refunded the difference. It could take up to 6 weeks for the money to go into my account so just wait. All seemed well. Our trip took place about 4 weeks later. I wasnt all that impressed with Qantas when we flew but thats another complaint. The 6 weeks came and went and I did not receive my refund. Once again I went through the process of calling Qantas and eventually got through to them. They said that because we had already flown we were not entitled to a refund. However I had already been told we would get the refund before our trip so I didnt understand how this was a problem. I was told to register a written complaint which I did. Months later I still did not have an answer so contacted them through email complaints department again. A few month later I received an email saying they were working on my claim. This went back and forth for a while. 2 weeks ago well over a year since the original claim I was told they regret my experience but they will not refund my money. They gave me some frequent flyer points which I dont want because I will never fly with Qantas again. I truly believe they are in the wrong here. I was told I would get a refund and then the story changed after it was impossible for me to get the refund. This comes to like 400 which is a lot of money to me. Also just as a general thing. We have flown with a few other airlines since then we are doing humanitarian aidtype work in Thailand which is why we were flying when Covid was still an issue and every other airline has been just as good if not better than Qantas including the cheaper ones. This goes for domestic and international so I would advise anyone to not fly with Qantas even if they have a good deal. They are not any better than anyone else and if you have an issue its near impossible to work out. We dont get paid for the work we do so any money we have is very needed. Im pretty disappointed with Qantas and I dont want anyone else to experience what we have so please be warned.
Muscat to Kochi via Doha. I had a very pleasant flight throughout. Cabin Crews were there with a smile and attention to serve.The amenity kit only has socks eye shade and a lip balm tooth brush and paste were stocked in the impecably cleaned toilet. I enjoyed the quality of service without any glitch or gripe Looking forward to take my return flight to Muscat at the end of December this year and will post my review.
West Palm Beach to Marsh Harbour with Bahamasair. 3.5 hour delay getting out of Marsh Harbor on Saturday. Had to rebook and pay up charge on connecting flights. Staff kept telling us flight had left Nassau to come to MH but flight aware showed it had not left. They left our luggage in the rain and were slow to respond to our pleas to get them out of the rain. Staff appeared totally unconcerned about our comfort our luggage or communicating truthfully with us.
OSLLHR June 8th. Two days after arriving I departed still less my checkin bag from June 6th. Flight delayed this is more often than not on most BA flights I have been on. Food offered in economy same Chicken Tikka sandwich or bean salad as seen on last 3 flights in a week on different routes. I would rather have the option to buy something I might want to eat. Cabin crew Brilliant nearly always are but its not just about the crew service but its the only reason they have any customers.
I just wanted to share my terrible experience and it is the same for a lot of people with Aegean Airlines In my case after booking a flight to Athens they first cancelled my flight and instead of reimbursing the ticket they offered me a voucher. Ive reluctantly accepted considering that my girlfriend and I go very often to Greece because we love it and we have dear friends there. The voucher due to the Covid emergency still not allowing us to use it expired. When I asked a reimbursement as per point 9 of their Terms Conditions policy they have deliberately ignored all the emails I have sent. They have lost 2 very good clients considering that we had always flown with Aegean and that we keep going to Greece as often as we can. Now I will rather swim to Greece than using Aegean again Worst airline ever
Oslo to Berlin. Some people were made to pay 75 EUR for exceeding the baggage allowance which includes duty free items. Incredibly rude and aggressive to me told to either pay leave the bag or be denied boarding. You lost me as a customer.
Flew from Paris to Cayenne on October 2013 in business class. Overall good experience nice lounge in Paris Orly South fast track to go quickly from customs and police. Good seating on board with a 2x2x2 configuration. Not a full flat but a 160 degrees recline seat but very comfortable. Very good food and excellent champagne. But the most interesting is the price 1600 euros Air France is much more expensive comparing with Air Caraibes.
Toronto to Bogota. Do you like waiting on a stationary plane for hours and hours Are you allergic to water food and other simple luxuries Do you hate getting to a hotel that youve already paid for the day after you were supposed to If you answered yes to these questions then boy do I have an airline for you
Not a single time it has been on time even international flight get delayed by an 1 hour. Flown recently 3 times with it but every time same issue. I thought previously that it could be genuine reason and booked next time but no there management is worst
The worst experience I have ever had The app is horrible and faulty I could never get my miles and smiles rewards number to work and no one to help me they lost my luggage and the phone number given to me did not work. After many calls the rep on the phone said they couldnt help me and the system was not updated. They rerouted my flight and never gave me a ticket to my destination and I had to pay for an additional ticket from a different airline. Again the customer service agent in Istanbul told me he did not know what to do and told me to call a number in the USA that didnt work. The seating arrangements were messed up with multiple people having the same seats. Not one person who works for this airline could ever give me any information. All the answers were answered with I dont know. I still dont have my bag after they said they found it and would send me a tracking number.
Air France has been ok for sometime but on this trip their system would not let me enterselect special meals. They had the entire flight delayed by 45 minutes since their business class passenger was delayed. As if the regular passengers time is not worthy.
We traveled in Premium Economy on the Rome to Singapore route our judgment is very good more space and the recline higher than the classic Economy I managed to sleep which I usually can never do in flight. Wine given for the flight and a small Amenity kit containing a toothbrush and socks with a clutch. The flight attendants were very kind during the flight snacks drinks and food are constantly served. The onboard entertainment is complete with films in Italian and many TV series documentaries and music to choose from in the Premium class you have a Priority service from the baggage to the boarding.
Cape Town to Luanda and back on slightly older 777300 but still in good condition. Luanda Lisbon and back on 6 month old 777300 very good condition. It had larger screens than the older one but less movie options which did not quite match those listed in the inflight magazine either way selection is limited. Flight map system much improved in the newer plane. Seats the same slimline style on all planes comfortable enough with good recline and leg space. Pillows are provided but no blankets by default. Catering is decidedly low cost flimsy plastic tray and so on and cheap plastic cutlery however the food was not bad at all. Service was mixed some friendly others less so English definitely not spoken well. Luanda stopover thankfully short as airport is primitive with multiple flights leaving from the same gate at the same time which causes a bit of chaos nothing too serious though you will be checked to make sure you wont get on the wrong plane. Airport has no air bridges so you get a good impression of the sheer size of the 777300s as you walk up the stairs. This is the most direct route from Cape Town to Portugal hence the quickest way to get there as the feeder flights fromto Cape TownJohannesburg are welltimed. Arrival time in Lisbon early morning and departure time late at night also very convenient. All in all the combination of new planes nice good price with acceptable levels of service and catering make this a really good option for getting to Europe from South Africa.
The booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book. The cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare. Checkin was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in. Departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. My gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty. Some of the to buy MS food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirty. The staff were very professional and pleasant and the dropdown route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy. Hardworking crew.
Singapore Airlines lived up to its incredible reputation. The flight attendants especially the purser were fun to interact with throughout the flight. The beef rendang choice I had was delicious and the wine and champagne served was truly inflight dining at its best. The inflight entertainment had quite a selection of current movies so we had plenty of options to keep ourselves entertained. We were staying overnight at the Aerotel and the purser gave us some water and slippers for us to have on our journey. Although the cabin was pretty full the cabin crew made us feel like we were on our own private jet. Id highly recommend Singapore Airlines based on this experience.
Sofia to Barcelona. I strongly recommend that you do not buy tickets from this airline. I was supposed to fly from Sofia to Barcelona today June 27 2017 leaving Sofia at 10 am arriving 12 pm. As of now 420 pm there is no information at all when the flight would leave where is the plane currently and whether it will leave at all. The electronic board simply says the flight is delayed the person at the gate says there is no information available to him and the web cite of Bulgaria air does not mention the flight at all under flight status. The personel at the gate is supposed to at least provide water and snacks to the passengers waiting all day but every time we tried to approach them they said that we should wait to be called for food not go and ask for it... We ended up visiting the airport restaurant for breakfast lunch and we are headed there for dinner as well since no one knows when or if the flight will leave. We asked if we can be rebooked to RyanAir which also had a direct flight to Barcelona one hour later at 355 pm we had no checked in luggage and the flight was already delayed 5 hours but the customer service representative was very rude and told me that the airline does not do that we just have to keep waiting. In the meanwhile significant delayed were announced over the loud speaker for several other Bulgaria Air flights. All Ryanair flights on the other hand were on time.
Buenos Aires to Ushuaia. Aerolineas Argentinas workforce went on strike on 19DEC and suspended activities in the morning until midday this was not the airlines fault but the airline did not do anything at all to assist the passengers manage the situation before within or after the event. Just the night before this strike the airline sent an email confirming flight departure datetime knowing that the flight would be cancelled due to the strike. At the airport the airline did not provide any support at all to the thousands of passengers affected. All the information provided was that we needed to wait until 1pm to find out what was going to happen with our flights. The airport was a mess of people everywhere. At 1pm when the staff returned to work all passengers were told to call a tollfree number to get support no staff at the airport offered to help passengers at all the tollfree number was congested with calls and there was an automated message asking people to call again the next day how is that possible when people had flights to take to get back home or to reach a destination where hotels or other items had already been paid. The only reason why we were helped was that we complain so much and remained at the checkin window requesting somebody to help us with our flights we had to ignore the negative treatment by some of the staff and their management and just held our position until someone decided to help us and put us on a flight we arrived to our destinations after losing 1 day on our holiday and upon our return discovered that after that whole situation Aerolineas Argentinas cancelled our return flights which had nothing to do with the original flights impacted by the strike. Once again we found ourselves at the Ushuaia airport being told we had no flights having to deal with very poor attitude from the airline staff at the checkin counters but repeated our behaviour as on the first flight and told the staff we would not move until somebody helped us as we had nothing to do with the cancellation of our flights. Finally a manager agreed to put us an a waitlist and we were lucky to fly back to Buenos Aires. I would not fly Aerolineas Argentinas ever again if I can avoid it and I have recommended all my relatives and friends to do the same.
Heathrow to Auckland via Dubai. We were looking forward to flying with Emirates as they are rated very highly on some websites. We were left very disappointed on the first leg of the flight. The crew were miserable and unfriendly. One in particular was sarcastic rude and extremely unhelpful. Another couple next to us also mentioned how rude shed been. I complained to Emirates and they said it will take 30 days for a response. In my book thats not good enough. Will stay clear of Emirates from now in.
The Tehran lounge was really good free highspeed WiFi plenty of comfortable seating and endless snacks and food options which is really impressive considering that Mehrabad is a small 90 yearold airport mainly used for domestic flights despite being international. The A310 aircraft was really old but well maintained seats were very comfortable and featured a whopping 1.5m of legroom. The interior was definitely upgraded from the original aircraft as things like touchscreens were nonexistent at the time the aircraft was built. Bathroom was also clean and spacious. A small amenity kit was provided along with some masks and a hand sanitizing gel. A non alcoholic predeparture drink was served along with warm nuts. The cabin crew were super warm and friendly a warm breakfast was served which was magnificent. The service and amenities were unbelievable for such a short flight. Though no WiFi was available on board and the IFE needed some serious improvement. Also some snacks and refreshments were served before landing but I was too full to eat or drink so I just went for some water. We departed on time but arrived 20 minutes early and like all flights with Iranian pilots the landing was butter smooth. It costed 120 for a round trip in business class. Overall really good flight and I would definitely fly Mahan Air again.
Los Angeles to Denpasar via Taipei. Checkin at LAX was smooth. They gave us a transfer sleeve to store boarding passes for later segment which was a nice touch. We had a remote gate far away and had to be shuttled by bus. That experience wasnt very pleasant as we had to wait inside the bus for a very long time. Despite having reservation for four seats traveling as a family there was no available overhead storage. All four of us had requested special meals but the flight attendants started serving us regular meal. It was only after we showed them our boarding passes that they served our special meals. The overall ambiance seating comfort and IFE were excellent. Both B777300ER and A330300 were tastefully decorated. The service between Taipei and Bali segment was far superior to what we experience between LA and Taipei. The service on our final segment from TPE to LAX fell below the mark. The flight attendants serving us in economy didnt smile and were quite rude while interacting with us. So while friendly service was absent in TPELAX segment the WiFi worked well on B777300ER. Overall China Airlines offered an inconsistent experience where the positives outweighed the negatives so we will still fly with them again.
Flew Brisbane to Hervey Bay return. Aircraft departed Brisbane slightly earlier than scheduled departure time. However on return from Hervey Bay aircraft departed 40 minutes late. Both planes were grubby inside. While floor was clean the sticky dust up along the side walls behind the luggage storage bins was off putting. Flight attendants very accommodating. This flight is only 25 minutes so no sooner we reach cruise level of 14000 feet its time to descend. I like this flight as the scenery along Great Sandy Straits is quite stunning. Good flights overall. Recommend QantasLink.
London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon with British Airways. Good service from FAs and a high quality screen for IFE. But what a shame that otherwise British Airways business class seats badly need updating. Once a trail blazer British Airways is now an alsoran. Why didnt they ensure that the company took advantage of its new aircraft to bring its facilities up to date to make up at least some of the ground on the Gulf and leading Asian carriers
Southampton to Jersey. The baggage system at Southampton was faulty and my bag did not make the flight. The staff at Jersey were excellent Jersey airport Blue Islands and Servisair. They kept me informed and my suitcase arrived at my house at 8.30pm. A big thank you to all concerned.
Full plane the stewardesses were efficient professional. They serve passengers a complimentary meal on a 330 flight which is commendable. Spacious on emergency exit. Also bought a bigger chicken sandwich for 4.5 think it was worthwile on European flight.
Los Angeles to Melbourne via Xiamen. This was a long journey for me from LAX to Melbourne via Xiamen. This airline has great food. The portion sizes were big enough and they came through fairly frequently with drinks as well. The meals themselves were good. I loved the Chinese food selections and the highlights for me were the breakfast rice porridge with egg and vegetables and a fish and rice dish with raw salmon on the side and a stirfried noodle dish. The staff were generally friendly and nice. Inflight entertainment was good. Seats were comfy Im pretty small so maybe thats why. The journey from LAX to Xiamen was actually via Qingdao and the journey from Xiamen to Melbourne was via Hangzhou and this was stated in my ticket. The wifi didnt connect on my phone.
This used to be my go to airline but the past 3 or 4 times have been horrendous. Delays no communication rude staff and staff not knowing the answers to any questions. I wont be using them anymore.
On the flight to Tokyo I was separated from my wife even though it was our honeymoon. Thanks. The return felt like a 12 hour easyJet flight. One meal and one half meal. Limited drinks. Very small seats. Im 5 foot 9 and my knees touched the seat in front. Very very mediocre.
I have heard about the horrible customer service of Air India Express before but have never experienced it until recently. I was flying on Air India Express from Doha to Cochin on Feb 24 2022. At the check in counter at Hamad International Airport I encountered the most rude staff ever. On showing my full vaccination certificate Covishield from India with QR code they claimed this is not the right certificate since it only showed the date of second dose not the first dose. Isnt it obvious I have taken the first dose if second dose is valid Also in my certificate printout our PM Modis picture was not printed clearly and they raised an issue stating where is Modis picture This is not authentic. Does the airline really validate vaccination certificates based on Modis photo rather than the valid QR code right next to it When I tried to explain that I travelled to Doha 2 months earlier with the same certificate and had no issue the staff told me not to argue and would not even bother listening to me. He demanded I show him the date of first dose or I cannot board the flight. Luckily I had my laptop with me and I could access the first dose certificate in a couple of minutes. But the basis on how Air India Express staff check vaccination certificates and the way they speak to their customers is absolutely pathetic and inhumane. The staff need to be taught how to speak to humans with basic decency
LGWCUN Club World seat 4A. To be honest I wasnt looking forward to this flight as it was one of BAs so called Leisure Flights. However I was pleasantly surprised at the high level of service quality of food and wine and friendliness of the crew. Seat 4A is recommended as you dont have to step over anyone to access the aisle. I was first on the plane and first off it just a pity my bags were not the first to arrive.
Very short hop with flight time at 30 mins. Departed on time and despite full plane cabin crew completed a service with a decent cup of tea and a very acceptable bacon sandwich with no additional charge. Very friendly and efficient service. New plane comfortable seating. Exactly the same for the return trip a few days later. British Airways flight from LHR to MAN was impressive all round.
Colombo to Kathmandu via Kuala Lumpur. Our flight was 4 hours late so we miss our transfer at Kuala Lumpur. The company never apologize they lied to us they said they inform Kuala Lumpur airport and promise the plane will wait but nobody never called.
My husband and I were flying from Moscow to Bali via Doha. The first segment was okay but during Doha to Denpasar after 20 minutes of flying we found it is really cold in the cabin. We told the cabin crew about this but it wasnt ok even after two hours. We and the rest of the passengers put on all winter clothing we had and asked the cabin crew to make it warmer at least a little bit. It took five hours of asking to make it warmer in the cabin. I think the cabin crew just did not understand what we were talking about as the galley areas were warmer. They give you a brunch menu but our choice was finished by the time they get to us. I think catering professionals should know how to make all the items in the menu last for all clients. On the positive side the cabin crew were very nice and polite.
Paris CDG to Atlanta in first row of Economy on aisle. This seat is a little narrower with the tray table and entertainment console stowed in armrest area. The flight crew were friendly and attentive which always makes the flight more enjoyable. The seat cushion was firm which for a longer flight requires the addition of a few layers of blankets to make bearable. Im 62 and enjoyed the extra couple inches of space this seat offered. Took advantage of the Air France Press app on phone to download some magazines and newspapers to read. The Entertainment system offered a wide selection of movies to enjoy. Champagne and Wine is included for economy customers also. I had the included meal on the way to CDG and it was good overall. Decided to try the A La Carte Traditional Meal on the CDG to ATL flight which was slightly better than regular meal served. But the chocolate souffle was outstanding in the A la carte meal. Any advice would be for the other economy seats on this long haul flight have a seat pitch too small for most average sized passengers these days. The airlines need to understand their passengers are human and effected by psychological factors such as Proxemics when crammed in area where we feel others are invading our personal space but just reclining.
I have visited my husband 5 times I the last 2 years and have flown Qatar twice in those trips. Both times the flights are comfortable even though one of the flights is 14 hours. The food is good and the service awesome and they bring beverages often without having to call for service. There is plenty of leg room and seats are comfortable.
The flight was canceled without any notice. They offer no replacement solution and no refund at all. They are the only airline to link Bolivia to Peru so there was no other way to go to Cusco other than a 12 hours bus ride. I missed my connection and had to pay a thousand dollars ticket to go back home and miss a day at work. This is scandalous never book Peruvian Airlines.
Flight delayed by 1.5h Passengers were informed 2h before departure which was useless as anyone was on their way to airport already. Service was ok but food and beverages were very poor. No alcohol and food was bad quality economy class served on China. No menus. The purser told me You want chicken or pasta we also have beef but it looks just so so . At lease he was honest. Overall not good flight not recommended
My son and I have flown twice on XL mainly because we are on a budget to get to Paris. The seats are tiny and often the crew forget to translate what is being said into English. The crew in the cabin are good considering the long flights. The meals are horrible I recommend eating in the airport prior to boarding. If you dont mind getting up and going to find the crew yes there is enough water I recommend you bring a big bottle. The first time we flew the toilets backed up the second time no problems. Movies were in French only on 1st flight that was fixed on the second flight. Overall you get what you pay for so I will fly them again.
London GatwickTallinn return in Economy class in a Boeing 737. The queue for check inbag drop at London Gatwick was lengthy and slow moving for what turned out to be a full flight. However the flight boarded on time and departure was only slightly late due to a busy afternoon at the airport. We had selected the exit row in economy which had two instead of 3 seats on each side and more legroom. These were sufficiently roomy and comfortable for the flight. We had also preordered a hot meal and wine and these were brought to us before the cabin crew started the sandwich and drink service to other passengers. Both the food and drinks were good value good quality and helped pass the time on the flight. The cabin crew were professional polite and friendly. The return flight was much the same on time and trouble free. Tallinn airport had a much quicker check in than Gatwick and no security queue. All in all a decent service and pleasant experience.
Terrible customer service. Terms of flight clearly say if passenger cannot travel due to Covid they are entitled to a full refund. First their system charges 25 per seat to select and then changes it without any prior warning before your flight. Second when you try to get in touch with their sales office nobody answers. Their call centre In Istanbul keeps you on hold and transfers you from department after department following which they tell you to contact the local office. Local office says refund requests are only possible from the call centre. They dont know what they are doing. After clearly explaining passenger was hospitalised with Covid they refused to give a refund. Its been 4 weeks and they have harassed frustrated and caused anxiety to an elderly couple who is hospitalised in a foreign country and no compassion or help. Horrifying dreadful joke of an airline. Has traumatised us to never fly Turkish airlines or even want to ever consider Turkey for travel.
London to Istanbul. I am a frequent flyer who always travels with excess baggage up to 10 times a year internationally. As a result of the ultra punitive charges for excess baggage on the low cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet I prefer to travel with the normal carriers and was very keen to try Turkish Airlines as they have a good reputation and being a gold Emirates flyer I wanted to check the experience. How sad that they have such a horrific extra baggage policy. After battling to find anything on there site after booking my ticket I presumed that I would pay per piece and saw that there looked to be an 80 price on some flights. As I had already paid and unable to navigate there confusing baggage policy on line and unable to pay on line either I made my way to the airport. My ticket cost me approx 120 I went with 1 extra bag weighing exactly 23kg. I know how strict airlines are about this. I was horrified to be charged approx 230 for my extra bag. 110 more than my ticket and resulted in an increase in my costs by over 200. I could have bought 2 extra tickets. How can this be justified I immediately realized why there extra luggage policy on there website is difficult to navigate. Extra profits. Ryanair and Easyjet get such a bad rap for these sort of charges and they are open and upfront about them. To get stung with these at the airport and have them being double the cost of a ticket is truly blackmailing your customers. I learnt my lesson and will never travel this airline. Companies that force unjustified charges on unsuspecting customers should be held to account. Why is it so much How can one bag cost double a ticket price Shame on them.
Flight on 18 August 2022 was cancelled as a result of technical problems. Various challenges to find a new flight. Flew on 19 August 2022 to Cape town. Luggage was reported as lost on 19 August 2022. All procedures followed. Various communicate used to contact KLM WhatsApp messenger emails and telephonic calls. It is more than 4 months no compensation received not even for emergency purchases all receipts were scanned and mailed. Promises of customer care call back not met. This is really unacceptable and KLM will not be used in future or recommended.
Im a Platinum Exec with AA and Silver Medallion with Delta and while they both do a fair job they could learn a thing or two from Breeze The first class experience is equally good if not better than AA or Delta for half the price. Sure they dont have all the routes as the majors but if you find yourself lucky enough to in Breeze territory do it Ive had 2 small delays so far and get this without even asking both times by the time I landed they had added money to my breeze points. And not an insignificant amount either. I sat on a tarmac for 6 hours and didnt even get an apology from AA FAs are all young kids learning the business but eager to help and bright eyed and bushy tailed. They have all are so polite and charismatic . Ive loved several of their pre flight speeches. Very funny. Keep it up Breeze You have a loyal customer in me.
Airline has a bad customer service. Clerk was not able to provide any solution to the delay on their behalf since they where not prepare to swap a plane due to pilot grounding a plane due to mechanical issue. Where waiting for over 4 hrs with no solution the airline did not even provide any snack to customers due to their delay.
Kathmandu to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. One of the worst airlines to fly with which has zero customer service. The passenger next to me who had a very limited English was asking for water and the lady denied to provide water. I offer her to pay by my card and she told me she doesnt have authority to take the card. My friend and I made a formal complaint to the authority of Malindo in Perth with the hope that we will get some feedback but they didnt feel any importance to reply us.
This was my third trip with Emirates from London to Bangkok via Dubai and first in Business having been fortunate to fly in first on the previous two trips. Emirates is still one of the few airlines to offer a courtesy chauffeur service at selected airports this is a huge cost saving and always appreciated. The moment you board the plane you get the feeling that your custom is valued that every effort will be made to make your journey as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. The seats are spacious and luxurious. The choice of beverages superb the bar at the back of the cabin an excellent escape and great opportunity to socialise with other passengers and cabin crew. The dining option was a decent choice and as good as youd expect if you were dining out. Travelling on an airline like Emirates is always the perfect way to bookend a trip and I look forward to future travels with them.
I flew KLM from Delhi to Amsterdam and have to say the experience was disappointing. I have no idea how it is rated a four star airline. We departed on time at 3am. The staff in India were not friendly. The seats are rather uncomfortable. My audio wasnt working properly. No pillows are provided despite it being a 10 hour night flight. The service starts with only a hot pocket and drink. No alcohol on board the flight for economy class. The cups are extremely small as well. Portion isnt good. About 2 hrs prior to landing we got the breakfast meal. It consisted of a watery paneer with paratha. The yogurt tasted sour and they didnt have proper chai. There is no Hindi speaker on board the flight either. Staff are okay but they really need to improve the quality and quantity of food on board for india. This was worst than flying United from Delhi to Newark.
I was on a 3month trip with most of my favorite clothes. Air Transat lost my checked bag. There has been no way to reach a human phone numbers refer to the online system. I took each step recommended online. It has been 3 months and I have received nothing but an autoreply to my substantial claim of loss. I highly recommend avoiding this airline at all costs.
Zurich to Adelaide via Doha. The business class cabin of A350 is airy the seats are comfortable to sit on but uncomfortable in bed position. The food choices were very limited although nicely presented. I had four meals two mains were good one was cold and one was overcooked. The entertainment system was disappointing a very small number of new western movies not a lot of choice in classical music and headphones of very poor quality. The cabin crew was mostly friendly sometimes efficient but often unknowledgeable. All in all a disappointing experience.
Chiang Mai to Bangkok in the afternoon it was a very comfortable flight. Departed on time. Air Asia has the quality of its own though it is a budget airline.
Dubai to Seoul via Singapore on a Boeing 777300ER from Dubai to Singapore. The seat was massive and in great condition. The onboard entertainment was fantastic with a great selection of movies. The food was sensational with a good selection of drinks. My flight to Seoul was on an A330300 which was slightly older and the seats were smaller. I was provided with the meal I had prebooked and the flight was excellent. I flew back from Seoul and the service was exceptional. I had 8 hours in Changi airport and the silver Kris lounge provide a peaceful environment with great food and drinks available. My final flight to Dubai was the best flight. Amazing crew meals and onboard entertainment. The crew very kind and asking to top up drinks. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience on Singapore Airlines.
London to Kuala Lumpur on British Airways Boeing 777. Outbound in First return in Club World business class. Flights on time both ways. Comfortable seatsbeds and very helpful and friendly staff. The quality of food and drink served particularly the food was very poor.
Singapore to Amsterdam. I felt so welcomed by the crew. The flight attendants were helping and greeting passengers and bringing them to their seat and helped them putting away their hand luggage. The meal service was very quick and efficient. Overall they flight was very pleasant and comfortable The flight attendants did Singapore Airlines proud and showed why this airlines has one of the best crew service I would recommend everybody to fly Singapore Airlines.
I flew Zurich to New York JFK full price business class and the entertainment was not working the entire flight. All Delta offered me was 10000 miles or the equivalent of less than 100 and sent me form email letters back. I recommend you never fly this airline. The Zurich airport business class lounge had very little food and was not properly attended raining as well.
Los Angeles to New York JFK. Having flown Virgin about 6 times in the last 2 months Ive been very pleased. The purple light in the plane is relaxing and the hostesses are always great. I love the Loft lounge before flights it makes traveling much more enjoyable. It is 30 extra but definitely worth it. Either purchase it online or get there early to be able to join it. Tonight I was flying from LAX to JFK at 1105. Virgin has a policy that you must get to check in 40 mins before if you are checking a bag. I knew this policy which is why when I was in the LAX car pool I tried calling them multiple times because I was at gate 1 and the traffic was moving slowly. I decided to go check in myself and pay my uber driver to meet me there with my bags. I make it to the counter 23 mins after the cut off. The agent said curtly that she could not help me because I was late. I said how I tried to call multiple times but no one answered. I asked what my options were take off is still 35 mins away and she said she coult try to put me on Standby for 7am. I asked what I was supposed to do for the next 8 hours and she said to sit on the bench or to get a hotel. I said I would be fine hanging in the Loft till then and I would gladly pay the upcharge because I did not book it for my late flight. She said the lounge was not open when I wanted since Alaska Airlines bought Virgin. I did not know anything about this. Virgin is more expensive to fly to the East coast and I never had a problem paying extra because it was better. But since Alaska took over it just isnt worth it anymore because it really is not better than any airline.
Taipei to Hong Kong in March 2018. I was originally booked on CX468 which departed 2155 but due to the late arrival of Cathay Dragon incoming flight and subsequently delay in KA749 in departure the airline re arrange this last flight to Taipei for me. Being a Marco Polo green member I took advantage of the fast track lane to board. Anold B777300 with hard shell seating for this flight. Flight crew are not as friendly as other flight I had flown with CX. I was surprise when I took a photo of the cabin the flight purser approached me that photo is not allowed in the cabin. Hot meal is not available on this flight. The cabin crew were seen rushing with the distribution of paper pack which contains savoury pastry cookies and a pack of ice lemon tea. Very little interaction in between the flight attendant and passengers. Cathay Pacifics product seemingly lack of consistency recently.
Cape Town to Johannesburg Lanseria on 03 Jan 2013. Flight was supposed to leave at 15.50. Received an SMS that the flight had been delayed to 18.00 then further delayed to 20.00. When I arrived at the airport to check in told that the flight was delayed until 00.45. No information coming out of the Kulula desk other than mixed reports. The only compensation we received was a meal voucher. Flight further delayed until 01.30 in the morning. The Kulula desk took our details and assured us there would be a taxi at the other end. When we arrived at Lanseria airport no taxis in sight. When the shuttle arrived it was a lone taxi driver. At no point did we receive any apology or plausible explanation. On top of that the quirky inflight announcements were not funny not at 01.30 in the morning. I will never recommend this airline again.
Cape Town to London Heathrow in an old but well kept Boeing 747. Full flight. Flight left and arrived on time. What made this flight so outstanding was the crew. Very attentive and enthusiastic. My broken headphone was replaced within seconds of me telling one of the crew when my wifes breakfast selection was apparently not available it was rapidly located at a different section and served to her pleasant surprise.
My 83 year old father was traveling Kunming to Kolkata in July 2018. Before boarding on his flight the airport agent told him he could not use the current ticket because his middle name was spelled wrong by one letter. He explained that he just flew on two previous airlines and no one gave any trouble. They made him buy a new ticket and had him pay 1100 US dollars. They said he could not use a credit card. I wrote to China Eastern after returning from my trip to complain. They replied by saying they would look into the matter ASAP. Three months later I am still waiting for their reply.
Durban to Lanseria. My wife was at checkin 40 mins before flight and only found out then that Kulula changed the checkin times from 30 mins to 45 mins before departure. No Kulula employee was willing to help even thought she had a small bag which could be taken in as hand luggage. This happened on the 13th Nov 2017 and I emailed Kulula on that day and to date I have not received any response. Pathetic customer service from Kulula.
Rome to London Gatwick. Delayed takeoff from Rome largely because the plane was held on the runway for nearly 30 mins. Cabin clean and in good condition. Staff attentive and professional. Seats adequate for short journey but legroom is not generous. Food ans drink welcome but the food poor and unnecessary on relatively short journey. BA could save money by limiting to beverages.
Overall the flight was modest. The checkin was done using web checkin was smooth. Dropped the luggage at the checkin desk with proper checking on my luggage weight including cabin baggage. immigration security checking was smooth. Boarding was smooth with proper arrangementlineup via zone as stated in the ticket. The seat was modest with good cleanliness. The meal rice with fish was good but can be improved. The flight stewardess shows her best performance throughout this flight. Overall I enjoy the flight.
Denpasar to Singapore. This was the best flight ever Singapore Airlines staff are warm helpful and very hospitable. I had changed to my flight two times because of a cyclone in my country and the airline was very hospitable and they changed my flights without picking up a fuss about it and they did it for free. Check in at Denpasar was very friendly the staff happily gave me a window seat and once on board I was amazed the plane was new and was extremely comfortable. I cant wait to fly with them again in future.
The really good thing about Hong Kong Airlines is that their prices are fairly reasonable and it remains that way even till a day or two before departure which makes last minute flying with them great. Also they do not charge a premium on oneway tickets i.e. The cost of a one way ticket is roughly half the cost of a return ticket so it really helps when flying multiple destinations. It was a disappointment that amenity kits werent provided in Business Class and the entire IFE system throughout the aircraft was malfunctioning on the flight. This certainly isnt my first time flying with them and theyre a justmeetingexpectations airline on the whole. Nevertheless after taking into account their general punctuality record I appreciate and would still recommend them for their flexibility especially for a lastminute traveler around Asia.
London Heathrow to Accra. Flight left nearly two hours late bit of an explanation but was really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure. This is always a busy flight with passengers taking on loads of cabin bags. Ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with 20 mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage. Chaos in economy class. On this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than 1 hr to departure. When will BA realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board it is the most delayed flight out of Heathrow because of this poor management. Fact. The ground staff did nothing to control the crowds simple and polite requests would have helped. The grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers. Once on board the crew were friendly and professional. Very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment poor food and very poor quality seats. The coldsalad options are far better than the hot offering in BAs club class. Still no wifi on BA Even discount carriers like Norwegian have this now let along the flag carriers like Emirates and Qatar Airways.
Not dependable airline at all booked my flight back home a month in advance and when I get to the airport the flight has been canceled with out any warning they state they sent out a. Email and I never received it. I was left stranded in a foreign country with. No help they refuse to offer any other options at the kiosk at the airport other than give me credit for their next available flight which was over a month later so I called the 1800 number and they were just as useless I had to pay 400usd with a different airline for the following day leaving me in the streets over night all because the airline could do nothing or offer any other options the supervisors were just as rude as the workers if not worst. How stressful it was to sleep in the airport floor over night and they could not give a care in the world
Flew Hong Kong to Dubai. In general the service of Emirates has been bad on my recent experience that included checkin and inflight. But what makes its service appalling is not just the no desire to help and no smile its the cabin crews attitude of too proud to serve the customers. Honestly I can withstand bad service from an airline but an inappropriate attitude is something that prevents me from choosing Emirates again as I dont think any customer deserves that.
OG605 10.02.2023 Flight on time off gate ALC ahead of schedule in KEF. Payed for extra leg space turned out excellent seating. Onboard service normal. At baggage claim in KEF no passengers from other flights waiting in baggage area not a single piece of luggage on belt for over one hour. Waiting for luggage is one thing but receiving no information or explanation can become extremely irritating. The unexplained waiting time in baggage claim definitely affected the value of the excellent experience during flight.
Tel Aviv to Tbilisi. I had an issue that I have not experienced in the hundreds of times that I have flown which Georgian has failed to resolve. I booked a ticket and when I arrived at the ticket counter they were unable to find my reservation. I dug further and found they cancelled it and made me buy a new ticket at the desk at a higher price. I find this suspect as I bought a ticket on another airline that same day and had no such issue with payment or ticketing. As a result I was overcharged 80 having to buy a new ticket at the gate because they failed to properly issue my original. To make matters worse all documentation and forms I have submitted to the airline to receive a refund for the difference between my original reservation and my gate ticket price have gone unanswered. I think both to be very unprofessional for an airline with international presence.
Check in at Bangkok airport friendly and efficient. Even Qatars Platinum members are not allowed to use their own lounge in BKK. Their contract Miracle lounge was very average to say the least and does not deserve the name. Boarding was well organized. Cabin crew was friendly and efficient throughout the flight. Food was a big letdown with no more butter for breakfast no pepper and salt or a small spoon for the dessert or stirring the coffee. The main meal was disappointing in appearance and taste. Internet worked for just 20 min after reaching cruising altitude. Al Maha transfer service worked well this time after the hostess did not show up twice at the aircraft earlier this year. Platinum lounge was great. The short second leg of the trip was uneventful the virtual entertainment system their new 738 do not have private screens did not work throughout the flight. Overall very average flights.
Leeds Bradford to Heathrow. Service is equal to Ryanair and EasyJet. Ive been flying with BA regularly for last 4 years and I cant get my head around what is going on. Complimentary drinks replaced with a Buy on Board menu and the flight is so short not all passengers even get served now Really just appalling. There is no competition on the LBA route but I certainly wont pay anything extra to travel with BA from now on if there are alternatives available Ryanair it is at around a fifth of the price usually
Bangkok to Pakse return via Savannakhet. Very nice little airline friendly crew standard seats decent snack for such short flights. All flights were on time boarding was fast and efficient. Particularly good magazine with uptodate and relevant information for such a small airline. Good prices as well.
I had booked my ticket online through the Wizz Air website in the month of April to go from Dammam to Abu Dhabi and return as below flights Dammam to Abu Dhabi for 2362023 Abu Dhabi to Dammam for 3062023. Experience for Dammam to Abu Dhabi for 2362023 Checkin was over the counter at the airport. Flight got delayed by almost 2 hrs and nobody knew what was the reason. No complimentary refreshment was given even after this huge time delay. I missed my connecting bus and reached my hotel very late at midnight due to this delay. Experience for Abu Dhabi to Dammam for 3062023 Now this is the real deal. When we reached the airport for checkin we were informed that we have online checkin option during booking. So they will charge to do checkin at the airport. That charge is almost 2 times of the cost of ticket. Wow By the way they will put every details like food choice weight limits along with all useless info in ticket but they will never mention compulsory web checkin option in ticket and charges for not complying it. Also they are so caring to send you useless mail before departure to remind you to check about destination visa but never remind you to do web checkin which is only option as per their understanding and its penalty. This strategy was used to loot almost 10 more passengers who were there on the same flight. They were also cheated in the same manner and they seemed really upset which spoiled their vacation. In short highly unreliable and really cheap tactics to take your money.
The best airline Ive flown. The windows shades are automatic dark automatic colors. The aircraft is big with many lavatories. Wifi is working for Krisflyer members and its free. The IFE is also working with great choices of movies and tv shows and a usb port provided. The breakfast was also great.
London to Bangkok. I was a bit apprehensive about flying BA Club World due to the bad reviews the airline has received recently. Boarding at Heathrow was well organised due to their group boarding policy. On board I offered a pre Champagne or water. Once airborne choose gin and tonic and cashew nuts. Meal pre ordered online. I found all three courses exceptional and very well cooked. The staff worked tireless right through the twelve hour flight. I know BA Club Seats are not ideal but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any Middle East airline I have flown with. Entertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp cannot see when lights are on in the cabin. Very nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at BA. I also must commend BA for their quick medical response to a passenger who had collapsed on the aircraft in club. There rapid response and actions probably saved his life I flew on 12 January. Well done BA you are pulling in the right direction again.
This airline should be cancelled. Ive flown Boutique several times to get to and from school. Every single time the flight has either been cancelled or delayed and the employees are unaccommodating and rude. Never flying again.
CURAMS comfort class on B767. Seat very narrow and no support. Legroom ok. Food one free meal was really bad and a small portion no salad or desert or bread roll. Seat was not working would not recline Nothing could be done staff did not seem to care. All other food and drink for sale during the flight quality of food again pretty low. Staff friendly but goes thru the motions.
Received an email at 3pm on day of travel to let us know that the ZurichCape Town leg of our flight had been moved from 10pm that evening to 8am the following morning. Annoying but compounded by fact that the Amsterdam to Zurich leg of our flight had also been cancelled and it was therefore impossible to get to Zurich in time to catch the delayed flight to Cape Town. Edelweiss offered no explanation apology or assistance so had to rebook flights for my family and I cancel and rebook hire car at extra cost and rebook accommodation as would now be arriving after midnight meaning that we lost a day of our holiday as well. On our return I wrote to Edelweiss to request compensation only to be told that as they are a Swiss airline they do not need to do so and therefore would not their reply as follows Edelweiss adheres to the legal texts of the prescribed ordinances and we therefore stick to our previous statement. The legal text of Regulation EC 2612004 does not provide for compensation in the case of delayed flights. For final clarification we refer to the judgment of the district court Bulach 02.02.2016 which has become legally valid and published No compensation payments are due for late flights to and from Switzerland. Allinall a terrible experience with a terrible airline customer service zero. Avoid
Rome to London with British Airways. Very uptight woman checking myself and husband in made me check my carryon bag that was substantially smaller than other bags taken onboard the plane. When I arrive to London I find I have no bag for my vacation No pajamas no toothpaste no change of clothes no toothbrush and its pouring down rain and cold here.
I have just returned from Zante and I found that both flights were what Id expect from any other company. Seats were comfortable however there was not much leg room. Flights were on time both inbound and outbound although there was a flight to Manchester with Olympic at the same time as ours to Gatwick which was delayed overnight.
Manchester to Brisbane via Dubai. I flew economy and does not do hot towel services or give out mini amenity kits. I was disappointed that Emirates only had black or green tea as their tea options. These minor elements arent that much of an issue but the big deal breaker was the inflight service. On my route from Manchester to Brisbane I had 3 flights all with separate crews and the service I received on the first two flights was awful. The staff were at best indifferent and at worst extremely rude and act like they are above you and the feeling of How dare you ask for assistance came across quite strongly with the most of the staff. Maybe I just had bad luck but I will be flying with Emirates again soon longhaul economy so I guess we will see if it was just a once off.
Lima to Cuzco. This is the worst airline Ive ever flown. Its almost like they try to be the worst. They charged us 130 Soles just to check infor the flight which was the cost of the flight itself. The customer service is abysmal the guy at the counter walked away with our change another clerk had to call him to get him to come back. Im pretty sure he was just hoping wed leave and hed keep the change. Their business model is offer cheap flights then scam you for all youre worth.
Washington to Bamako via Paris CDG. Our flight from Paris to Bamako was delayed for at least 2 hours but the worst thing was Air France listed that the flight would leave at 1300 but by 1300 they hadnt started boarding. By the time we boarded our plane was in the cargo strip and thats where we boarded. The plane did not leave until around 1430. No explanation no updates of departure time. A similar thing happened on my way back flight from Paris to DC was delayed for about 2 hours we were notified early that new departure was 1500. But boarding started around 1500 we did not depart until 1600 again no updates. The delays are too frequent with Air France and the lack of accurate updates does not help. I will think twice next time I am flying to West Africa which is unfortunate because Air France has the more direct routes to this region.
Checked our family in a non existing row in the plane. Row 32 on a 31 row plane. Once at the airport had to check in again with seats all over the plane. One person to assist hundreds of people lets say as if no one at all. Once at the gate plane overbooked rude staff probably fed up on handling the same situation on most flights since there was two other family in the same situation.
Zakynthos to Newcastle. Outbound to Zakynthos couldnt be faulted however on the route back we were delayed by 23 hours and not given any information for the majority of the 23 hours we slept on an airport floor for 10 hours with little money and food and the airport didnt offer a lot of food. We arrived at the airport at 3am and werent put in accommodation or food until 4pm. We then didnt get into an accommodation to sleep in till 8pm after being told we would be leaving at 6pm. Due to the delay we were told we would be given 400 compensation within 28 days it is now 56 days later and none of my party have received this compensation even after multiple phone calls to Thomas Cook extremely disappointed with this service.
An experience that was neither good or bad until we tried to order water for our 2 year old. We ordered it was asked to wait while the cabin crew was giving out hot food. After 20min we asked again and we were asked to wait. After another 20min she started to cry uncontrollably and we walked up to the crew who was still busy giving out hot meal that we really needed to give our child some water. When we finally got it it was impossible to stop our girl from crying even when she got the water well most parents would understand that it was too late and the damage has already been done. So after calming her down which took another 1015min she started to drink and became happy again. It was a bad experience for everyone our 2 year old us as her parents and all other passengers. A situation that could easily have been avoided which would have been nice as flying with kids often means stress. Why couldnt a person in the crew just stop for 1minute and help out They didnt even seemed bothered or at least a bit guilty when we explained that we couldnt continue waiting because a 2 year old doesnt understand that.
Manchester to Mauritius return via Dubai. Outbound flight to Dubai was good. Shame the aircraft was on a remote stand on arrival in Dubai but transit to airport was ok. Flight to Mauritius was satisfactory though at times chaotic with cabin crew not very attentive at times though understandable given full flight. Return flights were much better. Made use of the Business Class Lounge whilst on a 10 hour transit in Dubai which was excellent with great facilities had to pay GBP 80 for the privilege but it was worth it. Wifi was ok but very unpredictable at times dependent on how many passengers accessed it. Good to see more allowance available for no charge. No complaints. Emirates are my first choice. Good airline Meals were ok and service was good.
I would definitely recommend it. The staff are very polite and speak excellent Hindi and English. Some innovative ways to introduce safety announcements before the flight. The food is delicious and authentic. There is plenty of entertainment from both Hollywood and Bollywood as well. The only thing I would improve is that for tall people like myself there isnt a lot of leg room. Otherwise everything is excellent.
I didnt succeed to take this plane. I reserved two tickets 3 months ago and just 5 days before the flight I found that the reservation was cancelled automatically because my bank refused the payment at the time of buying. So during these 3 months I didnt receive any email or message that notify me about this. The only email that I got it says Reservation confirmed. I was really shocked when they told me that I cant find my reservation because it was already cancelled by the system automatically without any notification. After all they kept blaming me why I didnt check my bank account every day. I have to pay extra 400 euros to book another flight in order to get home in time. Really sad angry and helpless.
LIS to LAD. The flight was delayed seven hours first because of a mechanical problem and then because of the airport curfew in LIS. This left only 30 minutes to make our connection in LAD for our flight to WDH. TAAG put us in a hotel for the night free of charge. The staff in LIS were helpful and friendly. We ended up making our 30 minute connection because a TAAG agent in Luanda had checked us in for our connecting flight and escorted us to our Air Namibia flight to WDH. The flight was operated by a Boeing 777200ER which was comfortable. There is AVOD mood lighting footrests and winged headrests on this aircraft. The food was tasty and cabin crew friendly.
Jakarta to Amsterdam. Great flight Scored an entire row of 3 seats so could lie down to sleep too. Food was the only disappointment with limited selection and poor quality. Selection of movies offered featured too many Indonesian ones but enough Western ones to fill one flights time. Crew lovely ready to give extra drinks at any time upon request.
LHR to CPT in first 777 aircraft. Concorde room as always quiet and private with excellent bar service we did not try the restaurant and wonderful views from the terrace plenty of natural light. Boarding by separate bridge. A warm welcome greeted by name and escorted to my seat by a smiling member of staff. Offered a glass of champagne wash bag and night suit. Departure and arrival on time. Food and beverages very good excellent bloody Mary. Bed was made by staff with extra mattress provided. Very good level of comfort. Entertainment of good standard in generally I prefer to sleep. Staff brilliant always smiling and discretely present to serve. Small hiccup no hot breakfast in the morning no explanation given. Overall an excellent trip of very high standard with an impressive cabin crew.
Auckland to Hong Kong ground service at AKL was ok. Check in no hassle. The service was not as warm as what it used to be but efficient. It was disappointing to see that their meal service was on the downhill drastically due to so many corner cutting to reduce the cost. Portion size was reduced but they did provide snacks between the meals. Inflight entertainment was very good. Seat was generally ok for me 61.
It took Copa almost an hour for no less than six people to figure out how to charge my bag and issue the receipt for it. When I mentioned that an apology would have made the situation easier they said I would probably be angry even if they had apologized I guess you cant expect much from an airline that only serves a tiny bag of platain chips as a meal in an international flight.
Lost my case and took 6 weeks to locate it and still have not replied to me after 8 weeks. I had a business class flight scheduled on Dec 12 2022 ... Manchester Copenhagen Bangkok and return flight Dec 27 2022 ... Bangkok Stockholm Manchester. SAS Airlines left Manchester over an hour late due to the weather and air traffic control. When I arrived in Copenhagen to get the connecting flight for Bangkok we were 10 minutes too late and the flight had gone half of the plane missed it.. SAS Airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being ... Copenhagen SAS London BA Dubai Emirates Bangkok. I returned from Copenhagen to London and the collected my boarding pass at BA. We were over 2 hours late leaving London due the weather and a passenger being asked to leave the flight. We arrived in Dubai late and was informed the flight had gone. Emirates then informed me that I had to speak with Thai Air to get another flight issued. I spent over an hour phoning Thai Air with nobody picking up the phone. I then spoke with Thai Air Dubai who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that I buy a new ticket and then claim the funds back later. I paid 1279.43 for a Kuwait Airways flight out of Dubai Kuwaiti Bangkok. Whilst in Dubai I checked with Kuwait Airlines regards my baggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from London and they would locate it and forward to my Bangkok address the following day. My baggage never arrived despite me completing lost baggage forms. I arrived back home yesterday and was informed by BA that they have found my bag in London.
ATHCHQ return. Nice new aircraft in both directions ATR72 and A320 with leather seats and good seat pitch. Checkin fast in Athens onboard service was great and surprised to get a meal on short flight. The only annoying thing we checked in an hour and 45 minutes ahead in Chania a bit early I know and the staff were present but made all of us wait another 20 minutes until they opened the counter. Other than that we had a good experience with Olympic.
Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. Qatar Airways is by far the best business class product I have seen. It beats emirates and etihad hands down. The food is outstanding cabin comfort is great and all food is on demand. The lounge though very crowded at times in morning serves much better food than emirates. Biggest down side compared to emirates is no chauffeur drive. The lounge they use in Atlanta is club atl which is ludicrous. It would be an insult to call it a lounge.
Could not fly in March 2020 because Covid. Spent over 1400 for the ticket now they are telling me that I can only get 131 refund. Cant get voucher or miles too. So Turkish Airlines is stealing passengers money or they want people to risk their life flying last year One thing for sure I will never book a ticket with Turkish Airlines again.
Madrid to Punta Cana. First time to travel with Air Europa overall a very bad experience. Family with a toddler in emergency row seat. Horrified to find no entertainment system for travellers a 9 hour flight with no entertainment in this day and age is simply antiquated. The plane was very old and shabby. The main meal was actually OK and free of charge. One drink was provided and a small plastic cup of water too if requested. If you wanted another drink it had to be paid for yet this service was not always available and only when the cabin crew had finished their duties could we even begin to pay for another drink. The 2nd meal was paid for. During the flight I was so thirsty and with a baby sleeping on my arm I had to get up and try to get a drink of water. The cabin crew were sleeping or reading a book it was a big ask to have some water they were rude and sullen and begrudgingly relinquished a small cup of water. Never have I had this experience normally cabin crew happily walk up and down the aisle with drinks on a tray. The service was absolutely diabolical. On the outbound flight our baby was refused a meal despite the fact that he eats too. We were told that we should have specifically requested it yet nowhere was this information available. Imagine refusing to feed a baby On the way back I made sure to request a baby meal in advance. Unfortunately no water was provided when I asked for water the cabin crew refused until their current duties were complete. Unfortunately even after this no water was forthcoming. Imagine refusing water to a baby This is a basic human right. What type of people are they Simply the worst long haul flight I have ever experienced. The withholding of basic human rights for a baby is simply beyond belief. I would not recommend travelling with this airline and will never fly with them again.
Could British Airways get any worse Flew Chicago London Heathrow in Upper Deck Club World of ancient B747400 British Airways business class is the worst in the entire global airline industry. The seats are the crazy odd facing each other with a rude screen and are terribly uncomfortable narrow. They must be at least a decade out of date. The food wine was simply awful and they didnt have the lamb on the menu but replaced it with some kind of beef mush. The crew were young uneducated and unprofessional. They were waiters and waitresses at best and didnt seem to have the social skills requisite to serving business people. Club Class on this route was also full of screaming children one of whom threw up on the flight. WHY do BA hold their premium customers in such contempt I can give you the answer They have a monopoly from the UK to the USA and back and no legitimate competition.
London Heathrow to Malta. Probably one of my worst flight experiences. Very unfriendly staff poor food and ordinary old seats in business class. My luggage arrived at the day of my return flight and when I requested a compensation of 65 EUR for new clothing with the receipt included they started to make a big issue over this by email as I did not keep a document which they told me I wouldnt need. Furthermore this document is printed from their own system.
My daughter flew from Phoenix to Idaho Falls flight 636 Jan 3rd. Here is the sequence of comical unbelievable errors by Allegiant but most disturbing was the nonchalant attitude with no communication and mitigation to the errors. Flight was late not usually that big of a deal. After arriving she waited over two hours for a paid check baggage with no communication at all on eta or reason from Allegiant staff. She had been picked up by a mother with a baby so they had to call it a night after 2.5 hrs. A passenger wandered out to the Tarmac to see if he could get info about what was going on .The passenger came back and reported that there may have been an accident with the ground crew that Allegiant was short staffed and they had no ETA. At no time did Allegiant send a message to my daughter through Text or the App even though you have her information and knew she checked a bag With no information and with noone at Allegiant Airport picking up the phone or calling us back we left messages the communication was completely irresponsible and nonsympathetic to the passenger schedules like college classes. I called twice myself and no one returned calls. She went back paid for transportation there on the next day Jan 4th but no one from Allegiant was there couldnt you pay for 1 staff to be there to hand out luggage She found airport staff who said they couldnt help but to come back on Friday the 5th at 9am or 2pm when Allegiant had a flight and therefore staff. Turns out there was no flight in the afternoon but we were lucky and we stumbled onto that fact no thanks to Allegiant so she went in the morning. Why couldnt Allegiant take action to at least communicate To deliver the baggage would have been even more helpful even it was for a fee. Why not use the system which knows she checked a bag Why didnt someone the night of the Arrival come tell the passengers we had an accident we are short staffed Allegiant doesnt offer services or care so come back when we have a flight so that you can stand in line and have an agent help you get your luggage that we will hang on to for 2 days and have you at our convenience come get it taking a chance on when you arrive because we dont communicate because walking to the waiting customers or sending an email or text is too expensive. Please let me know what happened and why. I tried contacting Allegiant but they wont answer via phone nor email.
I travelled with my wife and two daughters. They were in seats row 20 while my wife and I were in row 19 which were in different zones for boarding. My older daughter carried one violin with her with the case Jakob Winter size 805mm x 208mm x 138mm weight 1.5kg. My two daughters boarded first with boarding zone 2. When I and my wife boarded with zone 3 we found our older daughter was denied boarding by a cabin crew and stood by the front door of the plane for the reason that the violin case was over the length limit and she demanded us to buy another seat for the instrument or else check it in. We informed that the violin was over 100 years old wood and could not be checked in as it will be destroyed. My daughter also told the cabin crew that she had flown in many airlines and many flights including the outbound flight on Thai AirAsia DMKHDY without any problem with this violin and the case before. Staff said the flight was full so there would be no space in the overhead compartment to fit in the violin. We had asked her why the outbound flight DMKHDY was also full but there was no problem. She then called in the ground staff to come talk to us. We had informed him the same and showed him the violin case. He let us into the seats and we put the case on the overhead compartment without any problem as there was plenty of space. I understand that the length of the case was not under 560mm as required by the airline however the overall size and weight were much less than a regular cabin luggage and the fact that many people on that flight were carrying many large luggage and shopping bags onto that flight. I do not feel that we were treated the right way.
My flight was from Chennai to Miami on Jan 6 2019 ChennaiDelhiAmsterdam on Jet Airways 831234 . Amsterdam Miami on KLM 627. Ticketing done by Delta but operated by Jet Airways and KLM. On Jan 6th during check in at the airport counter at 5 pm the agent said the Jet Airways connection flight 234 from Delhi to Amsterdam was cancelled. There was no email or phone message regarding cancellation. It took them almost 2 hrs to reroute via ChennaiParis on Jet Airways 128 and ParisMiami on Air France 090. Jet air ways 128 is at 1.45 am on Jan 7th. Service attitude of the Jet Airways staff was horrible. They did not seem to care. one would say some thing and walk away saying some one else would help find the rerouting. They were going away on breaks. No one seemed sincere or interested in doing their job. Rerouted as Chennai Paris on JA 128 ParisMiami on AF 090.Connection time 2 hrs Later on when i check on line it shows the flight 234 flew as scheduled. Its obvious the ticketing staff at the counter lied. I cant figure out why they had to lie and made me stand anxiously for 2 hrs. Another problem is even though the bags are checked to the final destination Jet Airways would not issue the boarding pass for the ParisMiami segment asking me to see a help desk at Paris airport. This flight 128 from Chennai to Paris went in late and there was no help desk on arrival. I had to run to International transfer area security and wait in line to get on a shuttle bus to get to the Air France Terminal. Business class boarding door was closed by the time I got there. I was probably the last person to board. Ticketing done on code sharing problem Delta gives a confirmation number which does not work on Jet Airways KLM or Air France. It took me a while calling Delta and my travel agent to figure out the PNR number of my reservation on Jet Airways. Both said that I have to get the reservation confirmation numbers from the other party Delta says to get the PNR for JA from the travel agent. Travel agent says to get it from Delta. Finally Delta gave me a PNR number which did not work. So I had to call Delta again wait listening to music for over 30 mins and was given a different PNR number which worked to open my trip on Jet Airways. Despite entering the correct PNR number Jet Airways does not let you select your seat.
I used to regard Qatar Airways as one of the very best airlines in the world. This was based mostly on my journey taken in 2014 from Warsaw to Hanoi via Doha. I was impressed by the quality and standards QA presented then. This is why this year after traveling with Emirates in 2015 I decided to fly with Qatar Airways to Sri Lanka from Warsaw. Unfortunately this time I was left disappointed. 1 Changing an aircraft choosing QA I was tempted with advertisements of a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. I chose the connection offering this very plane but a few months later it was changed for one of the oldest machines used by QA Airbus 340. 2 On board service in 2014 every passenger was given a travel set earplugs toothbrush etc during my last flight which was overnight no such thing was available. 3 Meals in 2014 there were two meals served main dish and a snack now its only one. 4 No snacks were available during my QR664 flight unlike in 2014 5 Drinks QR boast about being the one air company offering champagne in economy class. No such thing was available neither on my first flight from Warsaw to Doha this year nor during flight from Doha to Colombo. These are not very big problems but they have left me thinking it was only two years so many changes and all of them for the worse.
Kingston to Santo Domingo via Curacao with Insel Air. A long and disturbing story our scheduled flight was for around 10.00 yesterday morning but the flight was delayed until 10.30pm We asked if we could go on the Copa Airlines flight at 3.30 pm via Panama but we were told that Insel had no arrangements with Copa and so the answer was no. We were then left stranded for more than 12 hours. When we returned to the airport at 8.00 the flight did not leave until almost midnight delivering us in Curacao 2 hours 45 mins later. Exhausted we left the plane and were directed by one of the ground staff to a lady who asked a couple of questions but continued to go about her business after a while I asked her what was going on and could I please have the vouchers her colleague told us that she would give to us Reluctantly she started to write out a set of vouchers out of which she gave us I also asked her if I could have the third which was a taxi voucher to tke us to our hotel this she refused to give us as she said she couldnt as she had to wait for other passengers. I told her that my wife was recovering from surgery and it was imperative that we got to our beds as soon as possible but she basically said it was her way or the highway After about an hour we decided to take the cab ourselves and armed with our hotel voucher and our return taxi voucher we went looking for a cab we found one but the problem was that for this 10 mins ride they wanted 50USD and didnt tke a credit card. We had no choice but to return to this lady clearly we couldnt go back through customs and so a customs officer called her she didnt come immediately but when she did she verbally abused my wife and I suggesting she was doing us some sort of favor This abuse took the form of speaking Flemish and continued all the way up to the cab stand sounding off to anyone who would listen. We entered the cab and for a full 5 minutes she continued this abuse with our cab driver as she reluctantly wrote out our voucher. We left that airport in the cab nearly an hour and a half after landing at 3.00 in the morning only to be taken to a hotel that was closed This story goes on and on but we didnt get to a bed until after 5am. This member of staff was a disgrace and a complete opposite to another lady who eventually arranged our hotel room. To sum up if Insel Air is employing staff such as the one we encountered this sends a clear message that the airline does not care for its stranded passengers
Good experience check in was smooth so as boarding at Srinagar additional security check required and was done smoothly by airline. Seat was comfortable was a short route so only snacks was provided that can be improved. Inflight entertainment is provided through wifi connect to flight wifi which can be used to open Vistara on flight entertainment website on individual devices. Overall good experience.
Always loved Singapore Airlines and flew them in all classes many many times. On this occasion flew them on a night flight from Frankfurt to Singapore. Aircraft got switched from an A350 onto A380 on the day and generally that is a great thing as always love an A380. However my bulk head seat was not the samegood option as it was on the A350. A380 Business Class bed is rather hard so not the most comfortable to sleep in. In that regard prefer the A350777 and the older A380s much more I ordered a Gluten free meal and unfortunately the dinner main was pretty much inedible. Which is a shame. Breakfast was fine however. Service and crew were excellent as usual.
The worst experience ever. Departure was fine and return was a nightmare. United canceled my flight at 330am in the mourning while in route to airport. Couldnt make contact with an agent to help us tried to rebook a flight for next day on their app and flights were at 1500 or per person. I was traveling with my wife daughter and 2 dogs. Ive been trying to get a refund because I had to spend over double the amount for tickets through JET BLUE. Flew into JFK instead of Newark taxi was almost 200 to get home. Reached out to United customer service as instructed by their associate after a hour Waite on the phone and no one has responded. I dont think I will ever fly united ever again. Still waiting for a refund and a response till to date.
I was very disappointed with the flight and staff who overcharged me for luggage. I paid for extra luggage through the app but I was told the 40 kg that I paid extra for was free and included within my ticket price and my son had no allowance dispite paying full adult rates. In had the police called on me at the airport when I tried to stand my ground but fortunately the policeman was very good and took my side. The staff wasted over 2 and a half hour of our time and the only way we could get on the plane was to pay extra. After writing to Pegasus they now say they have investigated but have all the facts wrong and have refused to refund the extra charges. They have unfortunately ruined our holiday at the last and left us so disheartened that we will definitely not be travelling with them again.
My Kiev to Nantes via Amsterdam flight for the end of July was partially cancelled. No option to get cashback for the whole flight. No alternative proposed by the airline. Reservation was done directly through the site airfrance.fr. Flight is served by Air France and KLM. Search in Internet and on Air France site for solution no solution. Search in Internet and on Air France site for email or other digital communication service no solution. Call Air France French support after 40 minutes I got a person answered in English which redirected me on other phone line. After 40 minutes on the other hone line the call is ended with no answer. Next day after 1 hour I got an answer that I should contact KLM service support for my problem. After 1 hour on phone I finally got in contact with KLM. They told that I should call another country KLM customer support.
Garuda Indonesia GA89. Second time flying their B777 route AMSCGK and vise versa. Flying during pandemic doesnt stop the cabin crew to provide their best service as always. Helpful sincere friendly and attentive this is how I describe GA cabin crew. Meals served as always course by course as if you are experiencing an Ala Carte dining. Unlike other airlines that decided to serve their meals in a box and cut services from usual but not in GA. Covid19 measurement is nicely done all crews wearing mask and hand gloves. There is no unnecessary attributes. Business class lavatories are huge in comparison with KLMs I flew weeks ago. Seats comes in 121 configurations while many airlines are still on 222 or even 232. Social distance is well practiced on board which is the most important case nowadays. Same goes to some of their domestic route such as CGKDPS will fly only wide body aircrafts to ensure the social distancing. Cant wait to experience this route in a few days after 5 days compulsory quarantine in Jakarta for all international arrivals to Indonesia.
A woman named Shawna at Alaska Airlines LAX helped me out and let me tell you I travel every other week so ALOT and Ive never met a more kind and helpful employee at an airport before. She had the most positive attitude Ive ever seen and thats why I wanted to write this review. I offered her a tip and she denied. Protect this woman at all costs.
Flight suddenly got delayed hour after hour when they knew the weather forecast was going to be bad all day. They should have let us all know if advance. They also started offering dinner vouchers in secret I did not get notified about any of this until I excited the boarding area and went back to the checkin booths and demanded compensation. They agreed to pay for my dinner but the dinner voucher was 15 CAD in what airport do you think dinner is 15 dollars Do you guys think Im buying lays and Pepsi for dinner Such disrespect.
I had not heard of Air KBZ before I made the booking for my Myanmar trip. However all of the three domestic flights Mandalay to Thandwe Thandwe to Sittwe and Sittwe to Yangon went very well ontime arrivals food and beverages free of charge although the flights were short friendly staff modern and clean aircraft. I would fly Air KBZ again in case I return to Myanmar.
Round trip for a weekend getaway flying from Seoul to Tokyo. As always an extremely efficient boarding of 100 full plane in just 20 minutes at both Gimpo and Haneda airports. Cabin spotless and excellent condition. Crew professional and polite as always. I normally enjoy the food on ANA except for HNDGMP steamed seafood dish. I appreciate the effort of multiple seafood types on an airplane but literally zero taste on this one. At HND I didnt check my bag with duty free alcohol and was sent to check it in with just 25 minutes before take off. The staff politely hurried me back to the counter and again through security and the bag still made it. Impressive
Santa Marta to Bogota. Really do not fly with this airline as a regular flyer I can tell you they are so bad and rude from ground staff to cabin and as others have said charge for everything as extras even tried to charge for my partners hand bag. I end up paying extra to sit with my partner as the computer put us in different seats and told if we changed on the plane we would be charged. As it was once on the plane everyone moved around to different seats without paying if you work out the extras its better to fly with Avianca.
I was fortunate to check in for my flight back to the USA the night before the flight. The challenge for me though was being able to check in my bag right at an hour before departure from Seoul as I was afraid that I wouldnt be able to make it to the airport in time via public transport in the early morning. Happily that wasnt a problem. I was able to make it to the checkin gate right on time the staff were friendly and checked my bags with no issues. Gate staff in Seoul and Taipei were pleasant. The flights to Taipei and then to Los Angeles were dramafree. I found the cabin and lavatories clean and staff courteous. I did find the seats slightly more cramped maybe just my perception and inflight entertainment and meals to be a little boring though compared to previous experiences using JAL and Singapore these still fare better than most North American carriers in my opinion. All in all a positive experience returning to the USA. Ill value professionalism and cleanliness with friendliness as a bonus any day before watching the coolest new Hollywood flick.
As I am a tall person it was a bit uncomfortable for me and hence there was no option for legroom but compared to other flights I have seen my experience was also quite good. I hope you will increase the flights from Delhi to Raipur. It was helpful to me after thanks for the good service.
Flew MCT to LHR on 1 Nov 14. Staff at Muscat were excellent and could not have been more helpful to my wife who is a wheelchair user. Catering on the flight was awful. Food was inedible and we were only served two drinks over an 11hr flight. On arrival the staff seemed to not know that she was a wheelchair user despite having assistance booked in advance which meant a stressful wait on the plane while here wheelchair was found and a lift ordered. We flew out on Oman air that was faster cheaper more comfortable had decent food and better informed staff.
Budapest to Bangkok via Doha. Excellent service in both flights smiling and friendly cabin crew. Flights on time comfortable seats turning into flat bed. Very good meal and sweet wine. Big screen with large choice of movies.
Flew in comfort on Boeing 787 and felt more refreshed hydrated after the flight. Not all business class seats had overhead locker so I had to put my bag under the ottoman opposite my seat. The seat leatherottoman isnt that soft but provided good recline. Having seat sideways gave easy view to passengers on the right so privacy isnt maximum. The service may be a bit getitoutoftheway at times but the professionalism courteousness was excellent. Some staff very proactive into going their way to help passenger. The foodbeverage choices were diverse. Flavours sometimes werent strong enough though. Lighting can be improved with more colours. The quietness of cabin was nice but bizarrely despite being at front of airplane turbulences effect was still very clearly felt. Overall a pleasing flight.
Abu Dhabi to London. British Airways is usually a very organised airline. They do have a stuffiness and it irritates that we need to pay for selecting any seats even if we fly Business class. This is something that I and every sensible person would consider as utter madness. I did not pay a penny and managed to get an aisle seat for my AUHLHR leg on my trip. Boarding was chaotic although this is nothing to do with BA but its the airport mess. Staff were polite and efficient and we landed ahead of time. On departure we were given a light snack and before arrival a full English breakfast. Overall a comfortable flight.
The inbound flight arrived with roughly an hour delay and boarding was quite awful as we were told to wait in the jetbridge for around 510 minutes then we left with an hour and a half of delay and the crew wasnt very smiling and welcoming but you get used to it with Air Malta.I ordered a warm sandwich and it was delicious they have some movies in the overhead screens but thats it and the legroom is above average. Overall a great flight. However after arrival in Malta airport our luggage was extremely damaged and the ticket prices are quite high compared to what you get.
Seoul to Istanbul. First time flying with Turkish Airlines and last one. The ticket was very expensive and the flying experience quite bad. Economy class on the exit row and despite the big leg room the seats were so uncomfortable possibly the narrowest I have ever experienced in an 11hour flight. It was not possible to sleep at all. The seat recline was broken and my friends screen right next to me was broken too. Reported it to the crew but they did not pay any attention and they did not even try to help.
Horrible experience. Delay after extended delay and the crew is acting like its just another day with little regard for how much our days have been turned inside out. Their only recourse is to offer points for the next trip with JetBlue. Why on earth would anyone travel with them again. Do not travel with JetBlue. The few dollars saved is not worth spending an entire day in an airport n missing functions because of delayed flights.
Just disgusting. Flight canceled a month after payment. No reason no compensation. I am now forced to look for how to get through other airlines when there are no normal tickets. I will have to fly with an 8 hour layover at 5am I do not advise anyone to purchase tickets from this company if you plan to fly.
San Diego to Zurich. Excellent from start to finish. Punctual professional and passionate. Everything from seat comfort and service to inflight entertainment and meals was well above expectations. I left very impressed to say the least. I would highly recommend this airline.
YVRLHRAMS. An uneventful journey with BA but their Boeing 747 from Vancouver was a flashback to the 1990s. Dated interior with cold colours old seats that recline practically into your face making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable you could also occasionally feel the persons knees pushing into the back of your own seat. The inflight entertainment was equally old with a blurry screen and limited choice of entertainment. The cabin crew were courteous and friendly. Arrival and transfer in BAs Terminal 5 was very smooth and relaxing. The connecting flight to Amsterdam was a modern Airbus A319 with bright and comfortable interiorseating. Unless BA revamp their ageing 747 fleet consider fly with Virgin Air Canada or even Air Transat for the VancouverLondon route.
Superb airline with superb air hostesses Cant do enough and attend to every need with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha
Prague to Podgorica. Flying with SmartWings was a pleasant surprise. I was able to choose seats at the checkin desk as the online checkin wasn t working for me. They were very benevolent with cabin baggage. Plane clean and new on the way to Podgorica bit older on the way back however the seats very pretty tiny but OK for short flights. Buy on Board service is for very reasonable prices and I love their ginger beer 3EUR. Overall I was pretty surprised as I read a lot of negative reviews here before. Also the value for money was pretty good as I had a return ticket for 120 EUR which is pretty good for TGD airport.
My wife and I flew return trips on Druk Air from Kathmandu to Thimpu for a section of our honeymoon. There are very limited options to get in and out of Bhutan so I was a bit concerned about the ability to choose exactly what airline and flights we were going to take. However it all went really smoothly. We were warned beforehand that the flights are often several hours late ours was close to on time. We were told that wed see the Himalayas as we flew past including Mt Everest which we did. The crew were courteous and helpful and the food surprisingly good for such a small airline. The plane was old but appeared to be well looked after. There is no inflight entertainment system so bring a booktablet to keep yourself entertained or read the airline magazine which will mainly feature articles about how much the Bhutanese love their King they are crazy over their monarchy. If we are ever lucky enough to go back to Bhutan Id be very happy to fly Druk Air again.
Very disappointed with the competence of the airline staff. I flew on October 16th from Bend to Portland. After changing planes at PDX a flight attendant came to notify us that they had my girlfriends driving license. After speaking to them we were told to stay on the aircraft and that it would be mailed out to us in the coming days. Now after to speaking to the airline on four different occasions they are failing to take any responsibility and tell us that they cannot locate the ID. All they seem to say is that it might be lost in the mail and that they have no tracking number. Im lost for words to describe how useless they seem to be when they contacted us in the first place to notify us they had the driving license. We are hoping after 11 days and four separate phone calls that we may get a call back from them after they promise they will speak to a member of staff on call that day and get back to us with more information on the situation.
Flights on time. Baggage handling was fine this time around. Snacks were provided. Toilets were clean overall inflight experience was fine if not better than my previous flights with American AirlinesUS Airways. I would fly with this carrier again.
Ive generally been a loyal Gold status flyer with BA if they fly the route Im after but my recent flight to Nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get. We should have departed at 1020 but after continuous delays finally left 4.5 hours late not ideal when youve then got an 8hr flight. Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. They couldnt get it out and away quickly enough. That was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing. I sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service. They were all extremely miserable and clearly didnt want to be on board. Were still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in July for the cancellation of our flight to Miami in March. This was cancelled at 3am for the 230 pm flight
This was my first and hopefully last time flying with Avianca. First off they charge you for any and every snackbeverage inflight even water No matter how long the flight is one leg of our flight was about 6 hours they offer no complimentary refreshments. Secondly if legroom is a concern of yours I would aim for their highest level of seating which they refer to as Premium. These are the only seats besides the exit row seats with the most legroom on the plane. Even their Plus seats dont have any extra legroom than Economy has. My boyfriend is 59 and his knees were uncomfortably touching the seat in front of him. Lastly on our final leg of the journey from Bogota to JFK they made my boyfriend place his duffel bag in the personal item size guide at the gate. When it wouldnt fit because something was slightly and I mean slightly because if he actually pushed down a bit on the bag it would have fit poking out they took us to a separate kiosk to try to make us pay 150. I ended up moving one of his items from his bag to my own and that made it fit. To me it seemed like they wanted yet another way to make money that theyd charge 150 for a simple fix and if I hadnt moved his items they wouldve actually suckered us into paying it. This was the most uncomfortable and unbelievable experience Ive had with an airline so far. Definitely wont be doing it again
I booked my ticket last minute and as it was so cheap I did not expect much with Royal Brunei Airlines. The Boeing 787 is spacious comfortable seating and inflight entertainment system is good. However the selection of movies and tv programmes is limited but only a 6 hour flight. The food was ok but better than some airlines. The staff were very friendly and professional. I kind of expected a snack before landing or at least a cup of coffee or even the opportunity to purchase one. Overall a good experience but basic. Royal Brunei Airlines had a very relaxed and chilled atmosphere in the cabin.
All the hype about their food and chef onboard masked subpar service and performance on my flight from Istanbul to Washington. The FAs decided their work was done about half way through the 11hour flight. Ran out of tonic water served coffee with powered creamer and had a snack served without asking what I wanted from the menu. No checking of passengers being prepared for landing. I had glasses left on my armrest. What is with all the tieins to the new Superman vs Batman movie and media hype it makes the whole experience feel commercial and cheap. The lounge in Istanbul was crowded disaster and a 3hour wait for a shower.
Tokyo to New Chitose. My child is very anxious to wear seat belt during take off so Im asking the staff if I can just hold my child in my lap. They ask first what age is my baby and when I said 2 they say no and just ignore my child crying. She cried during take off and when she finally slept in my arms and its time to land the stewardess wants to wake her up and sit her on her seat So again she cried. I know Rules are Rules try explaining that to a toddler who is 2 years old.
Our international trip started wrong on December 25th 2022 when the pilot and crews of Cathay Pacific got Covid. We received a last minute notice that the flight was delayed for 18 hours later. At the Cathay Pacific airport counter it took 3.5 hours to rebooked us to Singapore Airlines. Upon arrival to the final destination we lost 1 of our suitcase and neither Cathay Pacific nor Singapore Airlines want to be responsible with it. They made it hard for me to file for lost claim and has become unresponsive to my inquiry. This has been a very stressful trip and unprofessionally handled. We had to extend the trip for a full day and we were traveling with little kids. Imagine that.
Horrible experience The fees are unbelievable. DO NOT FLY WITH FRONTIER AIRLINES We have never paid so much for checked bags as well as for carryon bags and of course seats were extra as well. We paid 140 per bag because they weighed 49. We had to pay 65 per carryon which by the were backpacks. Please do not Frontier Airlines. There are too many other options. Even if you save a few dollars on the ticket price you will almost certainly pay more once you add the fees for a seat on the plane and luggage.
My preferred airline for medium to long haul travel. Very competitively priced. Cabin crew very courteous and professional. Full services with onboard entertainment meals and drinks. Modern planes Boeing 787 on many routes pleasant seating. However connections at Doha can be a cardio exercise if connecting gates are located at opposite ends of airport the shuttle train since3 opened in January 2017.
Terceira to Lisboa. The flight departed a bit late thus arriving 15 minutes late. No explanation or apologies offered. Still the service was very good staff were great even when dealing with a medical emergency on board.
On my return flight from Madrid to Miami I experienced one of the worst services I have experienced with an airline. My wife is 9 weeks pregnant and on the return flight the staff was extremely rude and disrespectful. My wife was not feeling well once we entered the plane. I walked back to ask the flight attendant for some water and they rudely explained that they are not to give water in the beginning and if I new that my wife was not feeling well I should have planned accordingly prior entering the plane. After I pleaded to please let me have some water they provided some. The staff took no consideration what so ever. We had entered the flight early because we had priority boarding.
Disgraceful service for an airline that uses a BA codeshare. Arrived in Florence from London 6 hours late after flying to Bologna not Florence and then bus to Florence never found out why. Despite being business class the onboard service was practically nonexistent. I think this is a cheap airline pretending to be better than it is.
When booking a one way flight from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi I went with JetStar Pacific because Ive flown with Jetstar Asia multiple times and had a satisfactory experience and it was slightly cheaper than VietJet. Lets get this straight JetStar Pacific is not JetStar Airlines. Its a partner airline that was given the JetStar name so that they could have domestic flights in Vietnam. In this case JetStar should seriously consider severing ties as this is a determent to their brand. If you check online they have flights from HCM and HAN up to 7 times a day. I thought Wow they must be doing brisk business. I was wrong. One week before I received an email saying that my flight was cancelled and they put us a flight 2 hours before I wanted to depart. I was fine with that even thought wed have to get up earlier for our 2 hour trek to the airport from the village. But on the way to the airport I get another email saying that our flight was delayed 6 hours. When we arrived they told us it was a technical issue. We were told that there were no earlier flights. While waiting at the boarding area they only have 1 dedicated gate we found that they were boarding a flight for HAN. My mom asked why we werent put on that flight and they said those customers had been waiting since 6am that morning 5 hours for their flight. We werent offered any food or drink. My mom had to ask for food vouchers which provided us with a sandwich. As the time got closer to our supposed time of departure there were no agents at the gate no announcement made of further delays and no further emails. When flight attendants for JetStar showed up for different flight they were immediately accosted by several riled passengers. They were perfectly nice and one attendant looked up on his phone and found that we were delayed another 1 hour this is not published on their website so it was an internal source. So by the time we boarded the plane it was past 7pm. Lets check the math. By 7pm they managed to get off the ground 2 of the 7 flights they published. Passengers that day had more than a 70 chance of their flight being delayedcancelled. I have a real suspicion that this was really them trying to get more people on a plane to save costs. If this is their business model its not a good one since theyve lost any future business from me and anyone who flew that day.
After we checked in and dropped the luggage after the passport control we went to the gate where we waited around 90 minutes until a message appeared on the monitors. Canceled flight. Confusion long faces. After 15 minutes a young lady shows up and says to go back to take our luggage to cancel the exit visa and to meet in front of the check in desk. After 4 hours we were taken to a hotel to rest. Next day we asked the receptionist when we will leave. He didnt know. We tried to contact the TA offices. Nobody answered. We emailed the offices in Buenos Aires and Turkey. No reply. We were left without any news for 3 days until we received an email saying that we should be ready in 3 hours to take the shuttle bus to the airport. Other people were looking at us asking if we know when they could go because they didnt have any indication from the airline company. We were ready at the right time. No shuttle bus. After numerous calls from us and hotel reception a shuttle bus arrived after 90 minutes the scheduled time of arrival. It was a nightmare We couldnt go out the hotel because we waited a sign from the airline company and the data download cost is prohibitive so we stayed mainly in the hotel lobby where we had wifi. Avoid at any cost this company. The stress was huge.
Hangzhou to Osaka. ANA is truly a fivestar airline from my experience flying with it for the first time. I took the flight from China to Japan which only took 2 hours and 10 mins. We delayed due to typhoon but I could see the effort that ANA group staff and cabin staff have put in to make their passengers happy and comfortable. One thing I would point out is that I could feel the difference between the tones of speech from those ANA staff and those airport staff. And that tone will initially make the first impression for passengers. On board the flight I was warmly welcomed by the cabin crew. ANAs cabin crew hold a very high standard service requirement and they conduct that to a very detailed and careful level. In general the meal was one of the best I have had for this short flight and the seat was comfortable too. The flight was very smooth as well and the flight crew kept the passengers updated quite well. The most outstanding detail I noticed about ANA crew was their cooperation during the flight. Very tiny details such as a smile a please a twohand delivery a small candy and a poster card gift for children really made their service outstanding. If I would ask one more thing from ANA it would probably be SMS flight status messages as they can be very beneficial for passengers especially for those with unexpected delays. But overall this flight with ANA was 9.510
Porto to London. Third time flying on this route with BA and always boarding with a minimal delay of 1 hour. Poor snacks on board despite comfortable and pleasant flight. BA recently started this route some months ago with low cost flights but the service does not meet the standards that should be expected for a company with its dimensions.
Asiana Airlines is currently operating its latest A350900 from Shanghai Pudong to Seoul Incheon until end of October 2017. I am pleased to be on board this brand new aircraft on this short haul flight. I arrived 2 hours prior to the flight departure. Check in is prompt and smooth. Flight OZ362 departed slightly behind schedule due to delay from the incoming flight and also air traffic control. Boarding call is made half an hour prior to departure. Once I boarded the flight attendant guided me to the assigned seat. Cabin crew were busy distributing blanket and assisting passenger while awaiting for clearance for take off. Since this is a new aircraft the cleanliness of this aircraft is a plus. This brand new aircraft is quiet during taxied off take off and landing. I am truly amazed me with professionalism of the cabin crew despite that this is a 2 hours flight. In flight meal was served as soon as the seat belt sign had been turned off. They were always on the aisle to ensure that passengers were well taken care throughout the journey. Nonetheless the choice of inflight entertainment is rather limited compare to other airlines I had flown. As such I would propose Asiana consider adding more. Similarly Asiana should look into way to improve the cabin crew English proficiency. The overall flying experience is beyond my expectation. I look forward to fly with Asiana Airlines again in the near future.
MKYBNEMLB return. Overall positive experience ontime friendly courteous staff. Clean aircraft with plenty of legroom nice snackfood and bar service on the evening flight back to MKY. Qantas is still my preferred airline.
Bangkok to Los Angeles via Hong Kong. Efficient cabin crew serviced passengers quickly and met all basic expectations. They might not seem friendly but they were not rude. I assumed their focus were on speed and getting the job done. Good inflight entertainment lots of selections catering to local and international passengers. Plenty of snacks and drinks during flight selfservice style. Hot food were ok.
LHRLAX and ORDLHR. Great crew on both flights. The new aircraft are great although I preferred the 777300ER to the A380 as the journey was more comfortable and more legroom at the back off the 777. BA really have upped their game and would happily fly with them again in the future.
Moscow to London via Riga. Worst airline in the world Ive been denied boarding to the connecting flight in Riga without an explanation. After spending 6 hours in the airport with my mother weve been told that are fine to go then they sent us back to Moscow instead of the onward journey. Avoid at all costs
Manila to Toronto via Seoul Incheon. I like the foods on board the service and entertainment. Also the amenities on board.
Hamburg to Dubai. It was an excellent flight. My comfort was helped by the fact that the gentleman in front did not lean back and that the seat left of me I had an aisle in the middle row was empty. So I could spread out my stuff. About 30 min after take off I walked to the galley and asked whether the bar was already open. I received a smile and two glasses of white wine. 15 Min later they distributed food and beverages where the beverage trolley followed close to the food trolley. Crew worked with a smile. Beverages and food were good for an economy meal wines were even good. Throughout the flight crew passed by and served beverages. The IFE was high class and the internet was poor as usual. So overall an excellent Y experience.
Singapore to London Heathrow. Ive flown Singapore Airlines in Economy Class long haul several times and been satisfied. On this occasion I decided to opt for Premium Economy. I was flying from Auckland to London via Singapore but the first leg was on Air New Zealand and I recommend their Premium Economy service. Singapore Airlines seats have a bit more space and legroom than Economy and the inflight entertainment screens are bigger but otherwise everything was identical to Economy class. Im a vegetarian and I had the exact same two meals I had in Economy class three weeks earlier and I didnt enjoy them the first time around. My companion ordered the book the cook and his meals seemed better quality but none of the available options were vegetarian. For the breakfast service they completely forgot to offer us a drink. The service was bored and impersonal throughout the flight attendants were rushing around and didnt smile. The toilets are shared with Economy class. For sleeping I didnt find the seats significantly more comfortable than regular Economy and the fixed central console means you cant stretch out over any adjacent empty seats. That said Im only 53 my 61 companion did appreciate the extra legroom. The entertainment selection is extensive and the noise cancelling headphones good. However we were in the front bulkhead seats and the screens were set on the wall ahead of and were too high for comfortable viewing there are also irritating advertisements ahead of each programme. Allinall extremely disappointed didnt feel I got valueformoney compared to regular Economy class. This experience has really put me off flying Singapore Airlines again.
Hong Kong to Toronto via Taipei. EVA Air has one of the best service They are ready to help for whatever related problem you have. The staff may not have the best knowledge but they will find out whatever it is needed for the passenger. Had a 15hour flight delay from my flight back to HK from NY. There are no extras given to passengers but they make food vouchers available when needed. There is never a need to argue they are already doing the best they can before you even ask.
JMKATH A3 377 7 Aug 2014. Flew Mykonos Athens on a clean Dash 8. Welcomed on board by very polite and smiling cabin crew. Despite the fact the flight time was only 20 minutes a full drink service was offered with napkins ice and peanuts. The 2 Flight Attendants never looked stressed or hassled and full marks to the Purser for her excellent PA announcements made in Greek and very good English. Upon landing again the goodbye and thank you greeting was given with sincere smiles and professionalism. Shall definitely fly Olympic again.
London Heathrow to Budapest with British Airways. I did not choose BA for this flight. It was arranged by my cruise tour operator. Online check in ok. Bag drop agent surly and unhelpful. Terminal 3 lounge chaotic. Tables grubby and cluttered with dirty plates and glasses. At 10.00am in the morning the only food available was stale croissants. Servers in the lounge unhelpful and reluctant to produce champagne when requested. Boarding process was the BA chaos I have come to expect. Why do BA gate staff show so much resentment towards premium passagers. New club seating is atrocious. No better than economy with centre seat empty. No drink offered on boarding. Economy passagers access past club section via a very narrow aisle most carrying or dragging oversized cabin baggage. Late take off due to mix up over economy seat allocations and late arrival of passengers needing wheelchair assistance. Seat very uncomfortable. Little legroom and too much recline available to seat in front. The only saving point was the cabin manager whose hardwork and helpfulness was not matched by her workshy crew. Where do BA recruit such useless staff and are they specially trained to have no customer focus BA is certainly not my airline of choice. Many lessons can be learned from their no frills competitors.
Very bad experience with Turkish Airlines. I initially booked a return flight on the 7th of January 2023 from Hong Kong to Paris with a 4 hours transfer in Istanbul. With no apparent reason they decide to move the Hong Kong Istanbul flight to the 6th of January which means now I have a 29 hours transfer instead of 4 hours. I tried to ask for compensation but did not get a single cent. At the phone and by email they either send me to my agency where I bought the tickets or they give me conventional premade excuses. At their airport stand they send me to a Turkish Airlines agency at the Turkish Airlines agency they send me to their central offices in Taksim. So in conclusion I had to pay upwards of 150 euros hotel taxis meals from my own pocket and waste a full day at a place where I did not intend to be and loose one day at my initial destination.
Queued for Business class check in only 2 servers. Entertainment very limited games needs your own device. My meal was very poor. Seats and staff ok. Photo is the 5pm refreshment.
Absolute horror trip No communication and no customer support. We flew to Frankfurt and our connecting flight to Hamburg was cancelled. We went on by train but our luggage went missing No help from the airline and 3 weeks later still no luggage. All we get told is that they are still searching Then we bid for an upgrade to business class. We got sent an email that we did not the upgrade but as we step on the plane suddenly they billed us for business class by sending us an email while we are on the plane How were we supposed to receive this email while we on the plane When I said I dont want the upgrade because the email from them said we were not successful in getting the upgrade they replied that they had given our economy tickets away And no one will help. Not with the luggage they dont even know where it is nor about the miraculous upgrade. Dont touch this airline. Their cheaper tickets have turned into the most expensive tickets
The worst airline in existence. Lost bags twice on both the trip to Munich and when forwarded to our next destination and refused to admit fault and hung up when we called to follow up. Do not travel at all costs.
Arequipa to Lima. I had a very bad experience with this airline. No good information about the delay and no support or refund because of my missed connection flight and resulting hotel costs etc. Would never fly again with them.
Terrible airline transferred me on to different flights even though booked months in advance implying a schedule change but later found out that the original flights were still scheduled. Did not respond to my emails regarding this. Flight safety questionable with no safety briefing or clarification re persons sitting in exit rows. Would never use them again.
On checking in two hours prior we were told to come back as we were too early. We sat and had coffee as there is not much else to do land side. On checking in through the premium lane the staff member was checking in some of the 81 children school trip on our flight so wait we did. No lounge in Cairns apparently they used to have one. Boarding was efficient and we were welcomed on board warmly. The flight was uneventful entertainment worked fine. The chicken we chose was okay nothing special and the potato was gluey. Nothing as a dessert. There should at least be a cookie.
Leaving from Chicago OHare was not a problem. The problem was when he landed in Mexico City we lost a lot of time waiting on our luggage and then had to open all of baggage with security. Then had to run across to check in our baggage for our connecting flight only to get turned away because we were late and Volaris didnt want to do anything for us. Never want to use Volaris again doesnt want to help its customers at all and would not give me a refund or at least a credit.
Amman to London. Appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service. We are strict vegans so prebooked vegan meals for our flight. Meals were delivered as usual and had the vegan slip on them but as I was about to start eating I noticed that I had been given butter this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal. When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was informing me that there was no meat in it. I had to explain to her what a vegan was i.e no dairy or eggs. It turns out that the so called vegan meal had milk and egg in it. Needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals. Shortly after they came around with the drinkstrolley so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said oh I dont think we have that but we have semi skimmed milk. I had to reexplain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. When she returned she said We dont provide that sort of thing. That was strange because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did. So we had no meals no hot drinks and our video screen did not work. The Customer Service that followed from was more appalling they could not care less it took ages to get replies and when i did I was just palmed off. After several months of having to write emails I was informed that I had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper which was just another way of getting rid of us. So we did this after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation basically the value of the meals that we could not eat in vouchers.
Miami to Caracas. Terrible experience. Bought a non stop ticket. Upon returning Avior decided to put 2 flights together and passengers were sent to a different city we were delayed for over 6 hours I advised Avior that I had a connecting flight to 2 different agents that advised that they would contact Avior USA by the time I got to USA I had lost my connecting flight spoke the situation to Avior Personnel who not only were extremely rude but refused to pay for my hotel and took no responsibility on the issue. Next day I tried to contact Avior by phone and email providing all info to no avail. The difference between a non stop ticket vs a stop ticket was over 200300.
Was pleasantly surprised with Air France as I was expecting the worst experience. The aircraft felt up to date entertainment system worked fine and had plenty of choices. Crew were very friendly and personally greeted us and asked if we needed anything. The meal services were great the main meal was the best one I had in economy for quite sometime as mostly they are inedible but this was good chicken with mushrooms and polenta a small salad with Camargue rice and a delicious small pastry for dessert coffee and wine. The meal service before landing was presented in a small gift bag and contents were tasty a nice touch I thought.
I ordered an exit seat that allows for more space for your legs and paid 85 for it. The ground steward confirmed that I have this seat. However when I boarded I was given a different seat. The flight attendant apologized and said that I should reach out for the customers care for reimbursement. I sent 4 letters to customers care each time required to provide more explanations for this very simple event. Finally they answered that the company does not take any responsibility for this and that they will not reimburse me. Bottom line bought something that was not provided and was not reimbursed. I find this unacceptable.
This was the first time I flew Play and I was happy with all aspects of their product. I flew out of Stansted and had to get from Gatwick by bus which was a bit of a struggle. Seats were nice and flight personnel were pleasant. We flew to Stewart USA via Keflavik. We had a two hour stopover and I just sat in transit area and waited. Play is a low cost carrier so you pay for what you need. I usually travel with an under the seat bag so I bought no extras. At Stewart there is a bus that meets the plane and takes you to Manhattan for 25 dollars. I had a friend meet me though. All round good value for money.
Extra legroom not possible for over 65. We booked a flight from Tashkent to Heathrow via Istanbul 12 July 2023. I am 1.97m tall and wanted to pay for extra legroom seat in economy. During booking on website the seat selection option flagged that those over 65 cannot book exit row. Its first time Ive encountered this having flown on many other airlines where exit row can be occupied by 16 or older and capable of assisting with evacuation. Having accepted that Turkish and some other airlines set a maximum age I searched the seat plan Airbus A330300 and selected extra legroom seats by bulkhead row 11 not shown as an exit row. All seemed ok when I completed the booking and paid. Weeks later I completed the online checkin only possible 24 hours or less before flight which showed our extra legroom seat allocation but when printing boarding passes we discovered we had been allocated seats in row 36. The seat pitch is too small for me and most uncomfortable for 5 hour flight. Even painful when passenger in front reclines. There seems to be an unclear or unreliable booking process. Please be warned if you are over 65 and require extra legroom then dont book Turkish Airlines or pay more for business class. Another comment which might help some travelers if you are transiting in Istanbul then make sure your next flight leaves you enough time for transfer. Our flight from Tashkent to Istanbul landed 20 mins late. It then took an unbelievably long 45 mins to taxi a long way around the airport to hardstanding. Another 10 mins to disembark aircraft. It then took us 30 mins walking at a fast pace through transit and bag scan to next boarding gate where passengers had already started boarding. The flights themselves could have been better toilets were not cleaned all rubbish not collected left on floor during landing. Maps would not load on inflight information screen.
My wife and I booked two round trip business class air tickets from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls with British Airways Comair. It turned out that our business class seats were not any different from the seats in the economy class they had exactly the same width and pitch Actually British Airways simply separated several seats in the front from the rest of the aircraft cabin with a curtain and called this a business class Moreover our preflight accommodations were not any better than those of the economy class passengers because British Airways does not even have a lodge for business class passengers in Victoria Falls. Yes during the flight we were served sparkling wine and snacks but does this difference substantiate my paying for two round trip tickets 1372 rather than 703 which would have been the cost of the economy class tickets
Worst company ever we booked a flight where the online checkin didnt worked. Charged us 15 for every boarding pass when it was not our fault. Also in the airport of Cusco they checked all the luggage which made all the persons to spent much more time than was expected on the checkin. Some of this persons needed to pay the express checkin line to avoid the cue and miss their flights. If possible dont choose Viva to fly.
Mykonos to Thessaloniki . A short super enjoyable flight Everything went well on both flights the planes were nice and clean crew presentable professional and helpful and the flights on time short and so enjoyable I kept looking through the windows at the islands we were flying over beautiful Both flights were under 50 minutes long we even got a small bottle of water coffee a cookie and a wet towel. I can totally recommend Ellinair.
Do not fly SATA unless you love airports. We have been to Sao Miguel five times and experienced delays on three flights. Delays of 7 hours and 2 hours previously and we are now in the middle of what will be a 27 hour delay. They want us to fly Lisbon to Manchester via Amsterdam despite the fact that we will miss a connection again if there is a delay of 45 minutes. An inept airline.
Jakarta to Singapore with Jetstar Asia. Flight departed ahead of schedule. Crew polite and helpful. Unfortunately most seats didnt recline making sleep impossible on a middle of the night flight. Otherwise everything was OK.
AmsterdamCancun stopover Varadero. The trip started with a delay of already 3.5 hrs. Once in the air service not too friendly. Food very poor quality one meal free one drink free I took 1 litre of water extra with me seats very cramped even in Comfort Class comfort thats a joke. In Cuba it became clear that there was something wrong with the engine Dont worry its totally safe to fly on to Cancun but regulations make us perform a repair you dont feel very safe when they say this. We got off the plane and spent a couple of hrs. at the airport good cheap beer and cigars. We left Cuba with a total of 5.5.hrs delay. To make up for the delay we offer all passengers a free cup of water the purser said very funny and of course totally inadequate.
SGNDOHKGL on A330 and B7878. Flights on time. Service on board fine food is deteriorating small portions oily no meat options but FAs and drink offers almost make up for it. Qatar as a country suffers tremendously from the Arab banembargo put on them from their neighbours causing increased food prices and for QR it implies huge deroutings on most African and SAmerican destinations add up to 3 hours per leg. FAs are the best in the air always focused energetic proactive attentive and committed and hardworking. Rarely if ever Have I seen better FAs. Personalised service for everybody onboard the business class cabin. They still do charity collections onboard to my view a violation of passengers. IFE very good. Busgating in Doha annoying and tedious.
Positives convenient booking via mobile app very easy to upgrade from Economy to Comfort Class online stylish new terminal C professional and efficient crew excellent business classlevel soft product at Premium Economy proper business class meal with metal cutlery amenity kit hot towels cloth napkins. Drawbacks B777300ER in need of refurbishment hopefully this is coming soon very hard wobbly uncomfortable seats resulting in back pain unaffordable internet new terminal severely overcrowded even worse than in the older Terminal D. Overall a great product for a 4hour flight however should if it was a longhaul flight I would have reservations.
The meals were very good and the portions generous. The crew were efficient and were on time both ways. Seating assignments seemed ambiguous but my family of four ended up with one window seat on return to Vancouver from Amsterdam which was a nice surprise. None of my children had any complaint throughout the two long journeys and that would be the measure of a pleasant flight experience by my standards. I would fly with Martinair again in future.
Thank you Sheena from Flair Airlines for assisting me and my mother in law during check in. Very friendly accommodating and excellent service. I will definitely recommend Flair for the very excellent service.
Newark to Paris. I had a very pleasant experience at the airport and while boarding the plane. My expectations were low because of the reviews I saw online. When comparing this airline to others I would say the seats recline really comfortably and the bathrooms onboard are spacious and clean. Great value especially being an inexpensive airline.
I had to cancel my travel plans from Dar Es Salaam to Arusha due to a medical emergency. Coastal Aviation was very supportive understanding and efficient in processing my situation. Much appreciated. Great company.
I had the most fantastic BA Flight today. The cabin crew in my seat zone 6D were of the best I have experienced. Although the 777 had the old style rearfront seating it was comfortable and felt open and spacious. BA have done great things with the menu it was nice not to have to eat breakfast food on the prearrival meal into HKG at 1730PM local time having left London at 2200 the night before. The dinner offering was equally ample and delicious. The inflight entertainment had a great collection of TV and current films and the inflight map was first rate. Previously not a huge BA fan but after this 12 hour flight I could only recommend it without reserve. I flew the new BA suite in J class on a recent Delhi to London flight and enjoyed that product although I felt it slightly more cramped but I think BA have stepped up with really comfortable bedding and food and very friendly crew who engaged throughout the flight in the best way. Couldnt recommend BA more on this flight today
Flew Air Moldova on the Chisinau London Stansted route. Checkin efficient and quick boarding. The Airbus 320 was in good condition and crew very welcoming. Once onboard offered a cold meal and one round of drinks. Air Moldova makes a technical stop in Paris to dropoff and pickup passengers on this route. Given that total flight time to London including the stop in Paris is over 5 hours I think it does make sense to serve a hot meal and at least another round of drinks. I guess this was the only disappointment with Air Moldova.
New York JFK to Chennai via Kuwait and I opted for Kuwait Airways because of its low cost. The flight from JFK was delayed by 2 hours and the connecting flight from Kuwait was delayed for 2.5 hours more There were not much information on the reasons for delay or ETA. I had AVML meal and quality of food was decent. There was no additional service trips by the cabin crew even though we were waiting for 2 hours on tarmac for take off. No service between meals.
I flew Play in December 22 to Paris from Boston. What a pleasant experience. No delays friendly staff and ahead of time arrival in Iceland and Paris. No issues with luggage. The best part for me was clearing customs in Iceland so I avoided the long lines at major hubs. I will definitely fly Play again.
Ljubljana to Ho Chi Minh City via Istanbul. Great flights. All on time cabins new bright and airy seating quite comfortable. Asian vegetarian catering really very good. The best part of all flights was a cabin crew especially on a long distant flights from Istanbul to Ho Chi Minh and back. Professional and very pleasant. When a cabin assistant sing a song to himself when working at a galley than you know that everything is more than fine. Completely switched back to Turkish which slowly upgraded economy product over last few years.
The worst airline you can ever take. Dont even think about purchasing a ticket with them. It is trouble from the very beginning to the end. Cant make check in everything costs extra customer support is non existent.
Skopje to New York via Belgrade. Last time ever we are flying with Air Serbia. I dont even know where to begin. First of all when we landed in Belgrade they delayed our flight. I asked them why they replied to me there is no plane. How are they selling plane tickets if they dont have a plane. Second of all I when I got to Skopje I was there for a whole week with no luggage. I had a wedding I didnt have any of my stuff. I had to buy a new dress for the wedding and new clothes for that whole week. After a week only one of my luggage came. The second luggage came three days after. On the way back home I didnt get my luggage again for 5 days. The people in Belgrade at the airport are very rude and not helpful at all. I would speak English to them because I dont speak Serbian they would reply in Serbian. I even told them they still didnt speak English.
I was travelling from Melbourne to Kathmandu. I had two transit Chendung and Lasa. On flight to Chengdu I receive beef curry with rice however I ordered Hindu vegetarian meal. I ask for Hindu meal and air attendant replied me we dont serve Hindu meal. Really if you dont serve why its in the option I had one hour transit on Chengdu . One that time I have to claim my luggage go through immigration process standing on huge queue and drop my luggage and check in and pass through security area within one hours and there was no one to assist. Whenever we ask some one for help or anything same reply no speak English No English. On Lasa I crossed the security area but mistakenly my partners visa slip was with me. I request one security office to give that to my partner who was standing on another side of security area. But security man as just saying you go you go and he even physically push me on my shoulder. He was not even speaking basic English and becoming aggressive unprofessional manner less behaviour. Plane from Lasa to Kathmandu was smelling horribly sit was very old and looked like old local bus. I request two sit together they provide one on row 14 and another on row 15. I will never catch any Chinese flight in my entire life and recommend not to catch.
Vienna to Moscow. Terrible service on arrival to their home airport of Sheremetyevo. Theyparked the aircraft at Terminal B which is on the opposite side of the airfield from the planned arrival terminal E. Then theyve boarded the passengers into the bus and took on 25 minutes ride around the airstrip. Overall it took 40 minutes from the moment the pilot announced that the aircraft is at the parking position till Ive finally reached the terminal
Flight was scheduled to depart at 7.05pm and was retimed to 7.30pm. Then it was retimed to 8.10pm 3. It is currently 8.05pm and we have been told that its now retimed to 9pm. Very well timed as this does not place them liable for any damages.
Early morning flight to Jakarta on the A350900 with a 3class configuration. The overall ambience of the cabin is bright and airy and the newest version of the inflight entertainment is a big bonus for this short hop flight. Seating is comfortable for this duration of flight way better than the experience in an A320 or B737. We left on time and the crew were then rushing to serve breakfast. Food was reasonably good omelette or nasi lemak and we landed on time also. Crew were a little rushed and courteous rather than friendly but good enough. I appreciated that the crew were meticulous about asking passengers to raise their seats to the upright position for the meal service small things like this help in economy.
One of my worst encounters with an airline. I found 2 damaged luggage after taking Etihad Airways flights from Paris to Abu Dhabi to Singapore on 30 Nov 2022. Since then it has been a nightmare filing my claim with them. You will understand when you go through the entire process on their website. It has been more than 5 weeks I really dont understand why they make it so difficult for their customers as if to discourage us from doing so. There is no sense of customer service at all. To my horror the baggage claim officer wrote to say he has closed my case even after I have provided all the photos and forms. Etihad Airways can keep the measly compensation offer of US100. I am sharing this unfortunate incident with other travelers so they wont go through the same painful experience as me. You may want to avoid this airline. Otherwise buy lots of insurance to protect yourself beforehand
Sydney to Cochin via Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia X. Was pleasantly surprised by the legroom offered on both the aircraft. Their punctuality is to be praised. Pleased with the selection of food and beverages available for purchase that too at a very reasonable price. AirAsia X offers good connections to Asia from Australia with seamless transfers through KLIA2. Would highly recommend for budget travelers.
Flew JFKFRASIN vv on SQ2526 on Premium Economy. Great value overall with airfare at 1000 RT. JFK facilities are subpar in T4 for premium airline boarding was chaotic with roughly six separate lines outside main gate to handle the double decker flight. Prem Economy cabin was nice and clean nice orangegrey color scheme. Blanket and pillow on seat along with with noise cancelling headphones. Amenity kit upon request containing socks dental kit. Eyemask upon request. Nice pitch calf support and generous recline for Economy. Meals were on the smaller side only difference with the back I believe is an extra choice and champagne on plastic cups. Was able to prebook meal using Book the Cook which is a nice feature for Premium Economy. JFKFRA cabin crew much friendlier than FRASIN but still the trademark SQ service throughout. Krisworld has a great selection of movies and TV the add playlist is pretty nifty and easy to use. Transfer at FRA was 90min no fuss no security. Arrival in SQ was easy and quick. Check in on return flight was great T3 of Changi is very nice. Return flight was noneventful. Excellent service particularly on FRAJFK sector less full whereas out of SIN was packed. Great experience overall. Would definitely recommend the PremEcon if you keep the fare to less than 1200. Not sure if the value is there if you pay for much more.
Because of the current horrible airline situation world wide we cancelled our flight to Ireland England and Scotland. We didnt want to get stuck because of cancelled flights. I called a month prior to our flight to cancel. I was told I would get a voucher for the value of the tickets good for five years. I understood a refund couldnt be offered because I didnt purchase a refundable ticket. The voucher was fine. The agent checked the timing of the cancellation and said it was well within the period necessary to receive a voucher. I was also told that I would be after my flight was originally schedule before someone could get back to me since they were very busy. I received the following email confirming the refund. Dear Mrs. Ruppert Our sincere apologies for the delayed response. Your voucher request was approved however we do not currently have the ability to redeem vouchers for travel on other airlines and your original ticket included travel on A A Airlines. As a courtesy until this is remedied we will offer a refund. Kindly reply to this email to confirm if you would like to proceed with the refund thank you. Kind regards Customer Service Agent. Now Aer Lingus refuses to provide the voucher they promised in the confirmation email. My next vacation will not be to Ireland.
Tel Aviv to Larnaca. I made a mistake with my wife first name when I did my order through ticket broker site. I called Cobalt representative to correct my mistake. The worker told me that it corrected and I need to call the agency that I did through them the reservation because they need to draw revised data from Cobalt. I called my ticket broker site and they told me that they didnt see any email from Cobalt. I called again to Cobalt representative that told me again that now the name is correct and I need to call again the agency. This circle has been done at least 6 times and still after 2 months nothing had been changed.
Guangzhou to Denpasar via Singapore booked for December 2018. They rescheduled the connected flight in which made my second flight 1 day earlier than my first flight both are Singapore Airlines. I asked for cancellation of the whole trip. They delayed the refund for almost a month even I called four times. With only refund of the flight they still keep those I paid for the seats and said its nonrefundable. I understand if its my personal reason to cancel the flight I wouldnt have asked for the refund of the tickets not to mention the seats.
I flew Lao Airlines from Luang Prabang to Hanoi. It was a short one hour flight and the service revised by Lao Airlines was everything you could expect for a flight like this. They served drinks and a snack which was a tasty sandwich although there was no vegetarian option. The staff were friendly. There was no inflight entertainment but that didnt bother me as the flight was so quick.
London to Tokyo return. The service from London to Japan was pleasant and air hostess made me feel welcome. However on the return the cabin staff ignored me when I asked for water or tea. My partner was pestered to move seat forward by staff so that older folks behind us had enough leg space I was so annoyed as I have paid for my seat and checked on to see if seats was moved back. I was approached by staff later asking me to put down the window shutter when the cabin lights were down. I felt that they were more concerned about Japanese passengers then non Japanese passengers. I didnt complain to air hostess at time as I wanted to just go home. However this experience has totally discouraged me to fly with ANA again.o
I asked for an alcoholic beverage during my trip. They said they dont serve alcoholic beverages in economy class due to the coronavirus pandemic. However they serve alcoholic beverages in business class. When I asked does the corona pandemic affect only economy class They could not give a reasonable explanation about it. This flight was such a bad experience for me. If I had known before I would have preferred another airline to fly with. They use the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse.
Our worst flight experience in 40 years. Maintenance on the cabin area are completely neglected. We were sitting in row 15 and when you switch the reading lights on for row 15 then the lights in row 16 came on. The entertainment systems on all our legs were not working. The seats are dirty and damaged. To top all of this is that the airport building in Luanda is in a terrible state and a true reflection of the rest of the African continent. The ground staff cannot communicate in English and a simple boarding procedure is apart from always late absolutely chaos. I would never fly TAAG again.
Tokyo to Vancouver. They turned the plane around halfway to Vancouver for what they said was an injury which didnt make any sense because if it was an emergency we could have landed in Hawaii as opposed to flying four hours back the way we came. They gave us no information flew us to a different airport than we started in refused to get us a hotel and it took 12 hours for the flight to leave again and we werent allowed to leave the gate because it was too complicated. They refused compensation or tell us how to file a complaint. Service was horrible little to no information and they were still two hours late taking off on the recovery flight with us stuck in our seats on the tarmac that whole time then it took nearly two hours to get our baggage in Vancouver. Once in Canada a supervisor refused to tell me how I could file a claim or complaint which is illegal. They did try to force me to accept a gift card and sign a piece of paper in Japanese which I refused.
No food or accommodation on long flights minimal assistance and service. Terrible and expensive services for region which they cut further while increasing prices. Terrible monopoly business would not survive anywhere else in the world.
Dubrovnik to Gatwick. Poor ground service chaotic boarding via airport bus. No greeting or assistance on boarding from cabin staff. The shoddy service which has become the BA norm. Forced to fly BA by tour operator would other wise have chosen a alternative airline. Most food choices for purchase were not available. Tea was lukewarm and not pleasant. Cabin staff rude and unhelpful a most unpleasant flight.
I was positively surprised by the quality regarding every aspect of my trip. Both trips were on time staff friendly and efficient food remarkably good and the whole experience very satisfying. I will defo fly TK again A small but remarkable detail is that during their announcements which starts with Ladies and Gentlemen they also add and dear children Another small but remarkable detail is that each passengers receives a hygiene package that contains 2 masks disinfectant gel and other things
Our luggage was lost during our trip to Italy by ITA airways. We had to pick the bags up from Rome Airport two days later costing over 100 round trip in cab as they could not deliver. We were without any clothes or toiletries for that time and had to purchase items to get by. We were advised but ITA to save receipts and submit for reimbursement upon being back home. Our trip in Italy was 3 weeks long. When we returned I spent time on the phone trying to get our reimbursement started which took time as their customer service is very poor. Once I finally got their claims email they replied back stating we broke the 30 day claim window. They said there is nothing we can do. The plane was also old not very clean and the amenities were reminiscent of the 90s.
All sectors Kuala Lumpur to Gatwick via Dubai were on time. A380 cabin was spacious spotless clean and the inflight entertainment was one of the best no doubt. Inflight catering was above good and the portion was generous. The crew service was a big let down. Meals service took longer than expected as the flight was 99 full. Crews were unenthusiastic and clearly not interested in assisting passengers luggage during boarding and deboarding. I chose this Airline for connectivity else I would pay slightly more to fly with another carrier.
New York to NurSultan return via Moscow. Review covers SVOJFK SU10024Sep as this was the best of the four flights. Ground staff in all cities are surprisingly professional. Flights board well in advance of departure and airplanes when loaded depart. Schedules are not padded for time and flight time is accurate. Premium Economy is excellent value with comfortable seats decent amenities and big filling meals. The only alcohol served is beer and wine drinks service is followed immediately with meal. Oddly the second meal on both transatlantic flights is served 3 hours before arrival which interrupts the chance for some hours of sleep. Announcements are continuous and interrupting first prerecorded RussianEnglish followed by crew RussianEnglish announcements repeating the same message. Crews are typical ranging from disinterested senior to pleasant willing smiling junior cabin staff. Services SVOTSESVO on Airbus equipment with no IFE are similar with nice food disruptive announcements and decent level of comfort. SVO is sprawling transiting without visa is easy but you cannot linger between flights due to crowds and distance. Aeroflot was ok .... on time with good food and comfort. The nonstop announcements and timing of meal services however are offputting and would cause me to look at other airline options.
Flew back to UK from Miami in new Club World Suite a huge improvement on the elderly Yin and Yang style Club World. Boarding easy. Took off 12 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time. Very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces. Bedding and large pillow supplied. Attentive FAs especially Anna who addressed me by name. However let down by very average catering not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife. And sadly once again a very poor choice of films on the IFE which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen. Refused to pay BAs extortionate prepay to book your seat fees and still got 2 seats together. Cmon BA do we not pay enough already to travel Club Class I can recommend BAs new Club Class and we will travel this way if we can afford it in future.
Paris to Santiago de Chile. Great flight. The aircraft was looking new and clean economy seats are quite comfortable and the inflight entertainment screen is larger than others airlines full of music albums and movies. Flight attendants were friendly and professional the food was not bad. Definitely flying with Air France again.
Checkin is smooth the seats very comfortable and I find Newark in the US and Orly in Paris both more reasonable options than JFK and Charles De Gaulle for city access. I am not a big consumer of inflight entertainment but they gave out iPads that seemed to have a large range of movies and TV and even some games. The food is pretty horrible but does anyone really expect great cuisine on a plane We flew BizBed over and it was a treat to actually recline all the way and arrive semirested as opposed to uncomfortable United and Delta Business seats on previous flights. I would definitely fly them again and hope that they can stay in business.
While travelling with Flydubai anything that can go wrong will go wrong. I have booked with my family a tour from 15 to 23 June this year on Maldives flight from Minsk to Male connection in Dubai. The flight from Minsk to Dubai was delayed repeatedly we stayed at the airport for a whole night and then it was cancelled. We have spent a day in a hotel near airport. Next flight has been scheduled for the next night but it was delayed for an hour. Because of this we did not get to the connection flight when we passed the passport control it was already last call. Our flight was rebooked for the next night we spent another day in a hotel in Dubai. My son felt bad after two sleepless night and me with my wife felt exhausted. The last flight Dubai Male was also delayed but it is not the worst. They lost our baggage. Btw before that flight I have asked if the baggage is on the same plane and the staff representative confirmed. Therefore we have lost almost 3 days of holidays and Flydubai refused to compensate neither lost days at the resort nor compensation of moral harm. I assume based on the feedback and the comments it is a common practice for Flydubai to act like that. Never recommend this company to anyone.
London to Brisbane via Hong Kong. Not overly impressed with Cathay Pacific. In particular the new economy seating is great and comfortable in the upright position but for me is very uncomfortable when you try to recline it. I landed up with my seat upright whilst the person in fron on both legs put their seat fully back. The trouble with that is that then I could no longer see the screen for entertainment and my leg room virtually disappeared. The first leg overnight was also very hot everyone was complaining about it. The food was reasonable but as a decent sized westerner I landed up getting hungry by the time the next meal was served. Not too sure what the point is of supplying a tray with empty plastic boxes on it like someone had removed some food for cost cutting. Overall it wasnt very nice and not looking forward to the return leg. Flew previously with Qantas on the A380 to Australia and would definately prefer to use them in the future or Singapore Airlines
Do not book with this airline. It is a complete scam. Flights are regularly cancelled hours before the scheduled takeoff for maintenance and then a refund is never given. My wife and I were left scrambling to arrange alternative flights and we have not received any refund after 9 months of waiting. If you look online you will find hundreds of similar reviews.
Hat Yai to Bangkok. Since air fare can be reimbursed with the organization foreign government development agency I turned up at their counter in Hat Yai to ask for the receipttaxi invoice or any kind of document that has my name flight detail air fare and the organization name on it for the reimbursement purpose. The staff informed that no document can be issued here which for me was a bit strange because other airlines I have used could have done this process in literally a minute. After the trip I sent the request through their email system. Having waited for a week without any contact back I decided to contact the call center. The response received was that the consideration was in the process for god sake I am not applying for job just a receipt what exactly do you need to consider. Then a week later and still no contact from Nok air I decided to call them again. This time they said they will follow the case and contact back. I did specifically ask them to contact me back today because I got tired of the chasing. Kindly enough Nok Air contacted me back on that day informing that my information for issuing tax invoice was insufficient took them two weeks to realize that. Then I explained that what I need is just a document from the airline not necessarily tax invoice just a receipt is fine. Then I was told that a receipt cannot be issued after the travel. In sum the unnecessarily complicated procedure lack of customer service poor caserequest tracking system and inability to solve customers problem had made Nok Air uncompetitive with other airlines.
Flew from Toronto to Cancun Feb 6th 2020. worst travel experience in my life. I will never travel with Sunwing again and will warn anyone and everyone about this airline. Our flight was delayed 2.5 hours as we were stuck on the plane for this duration all that was offered was one tiny cookie. I forgot my phone on the plane and informed Sunwing ASAP about this. The only response I got from Sunwing was were looking into this. Emailed throughout the week to me. They responded on the day before we were to fly out that they dont have it and to check with Toronto Pearson lost and found. Once we arrived we asked a Sunwing rep at baggage where lost and found was and she just pointed and said that way. We asked a Toronto Pearson security guard he then informed us that lost and found is closed but that we can file a claim online so I go online to find out that I need contact the airline for items lost on the plane. So Ive been running around in circles trying to get an answer. Since we got to our resort extremely late and we had a long day of travel we were unable to attend the meeting the next morning. I checked daily looking for our rep who I never found until the day before our departure. Since we had a private transfer I asked the time for our pick up and was given the wrong time. On our return flight I got up before the plane was moving just after we boarded to go to the washroom. The flight attendant at first refused and said I couldnt use the washroom. Then I was given attitude and was told that I need to move fast because we are leaving now. I moved quickly. I get back to my seat and we havent moved were not even close to moving. She had zero issues letting the 10 other people who went well after me. Then come the drinks and coffee she fully ignores me asking for a drink when her cart reaches my row serves A B C D skips E and serves F. and rolls the cart away. I have so much more to say about this horrible experience but because it was an absolute nightmare Im trying to forget this trip with Sunwing ever happened. My advice pay the extra and fly with WestJet or Air Transat. They are worth spending the extra money
Doha to Johannesburg. Early morning start on an older 777 cabin staff prompt and helpful with a graciousness expected on Qatar Airways the seat was comfortable though the massage feature was not working. The breakfast selection was a little lacking though the portions were generous. IFE was good overall. An excellent experience but the ticket price was very steep .
Flew from Singapore Doha Milan Return out bound flights were great but Doha to Singapore was bad After three hours of sleep I went to put the Qsuite up and it broke got up out of my seat and tried to fix it and there was no interaction from the crew until I rang the bell. Flight attendant came and said that it was my fault as my shoes were under the seat. Seat was then adjusted to a ridiculous position which was uncomfortable to sit in. Breakfast came and flight attendant tried to set up table but could not be done due to position of seat left me sitting there before I complained to the cabin services manager. They try to fix it they managed to manually position seat for me but only a few hours to landing. Qatar complaints was hopeless saying staff did everything possible and they blamed turbulence on the flight for not attending to seat first. Offered me 10000 avios as compensation.
This airline is not clear on its COVID cancellation voucher expiration. I did not receive any notification on the expiration for rebooking my flight and now have lost the flight completely. I dont know how good this airline is in reality but you know Ill never find out. I will never book another flight with this airline again. I would suggest others to steer clear of Sun Country Airlines as well.
I was part of a group of 3 people travelling to St Lucia from London. Upon arrival at SLU we immediately checked in our luggage for our flight to Barbados. We arrived at the airport at 1830 for the flight that was supposed to depart at 1935. We went through the security gate and started waiting for our flight. By 1935 there was still no plane in sight. After waiting for an extra hour finally a member of staff announced that the flight was delayed. So we were given a new departure time and asked to leave the gate. After a couple of hours we went back to the gate but the plane was still missing. We kept waiting quietly without having any information or help from the staff. Finally after a wait of over 5 hours the plane arrived and we boarded. 15 minutes after we boarded the plane the pilot announced that the flight to Barbados was cancelled and he asked us to disembark. We got off the plane and started queuing at the checkin desk for the reissue of our booking and to be sent to a hotel for that nights accommodation. It will be helpful to let you know that by this point it was past midnight. As there was no room for the 7am flight we were given 1055 flight the next day. The situation had already messed up our arrangements in Barbados as we were planning to meet the rental agency for car pickup and the landlady for our house. I had to contact them multiple times throughout the night to keep them uptodate on our situation. After the long and tedious work at the LIAT counters the cars came to pick us up to drive us to the hotel. We were given a hotel at Rodney Bay. I think the location and the dire state of the hotel we were given is the subject of another discussion so I will let this pass. By the time we were in our rooms around 2am I believe we were exhausted angry disappointed and totally frustrated. We had already lost a day from our Barbados holiday which was in return wasted on airport seats. Nevertheless without losing hope we left our hotel at 930 the next morning and arrived at the airport to catch the 1055 flight. Upon arrival as we were checking in our luggage we were told that the flight had delayed for at least 2 hours which would push our arrival to past 2pm. At that point we made the disheartening decision to cancel our flight and our Barbados holiday all together. We had no trust and confidence left in LIAT as it was impossible to believe the LIAT staff about the true time of the flight or if it would ever in fact depart. For these reasons we decided to cancel our flight and find a place to stay in St Lucia instead. Thanks to this experience we had a horrible start to our holiday. We wasted hours at a tiny airport stayed at a lowbudget hotel and had to arrange last minute transport and accommodation due to the changes in our plans.
A basic but fundamental complaint. After purchasing two United Airline codeshare tickets on Austrian Airlines I learn that I now have to pay Austrian an additional 35 each for seat assignments unless I want to see whats left 47 hrs before departure. Doesnt Star Alliance Partner mean anything Doesnt status as a millionmile flyer on UA mean anything This charge is insulting.
This airline gets zero stars for ontime service. I have to fly LIAT to get around the Eastern Caribbean. They havent been ontime yet. Yesterday my 20 minute flight from St Vincent to St Lucia was delayed 10 hours.
It is more like LCC. Free luggage small snack given. Allow to select seats after blocking many seats saw it all vacant finally why Self service to get water no serving. Delay saw history of operation delay every day unable to plan with 2 hours transit afraid missing next flight. Ask me to get the luggage at my final destination but pass immigration when I transit but luggage arrived international side so we had to walk to another terminal to get our luggage.
On the short flight from LCY to Amsterdam they manage to serve a choice of sandwiches cake cold drinks and then a separate coffeetea run through the cabin. Staff are friendly and attentive and the cabin is bright and cheerful with leather seats. Take off and landing both on time or ahead of time. Compare this to the poor service KLM on the same route and the difference is clear Fly VLM
London to Kuwait via Istanbul. On its website and video Turkish Airlines advertise that business class seating on its aircraft is flatbed. Of the 4 aircraft I traveled on only one provided flat bed seating. The rest were old fashioned recline only seats. On one aircraft the seat reclined no more than a few inches and was the most uncomfortable seat that I have experienced in the last 25 years of air travel. So beware there is no guarantee that in Turkish Airlines business class you will get a comfortable seat and certainly less chance of getting a flatbed seat. The airlines advertising is misrepresentative. I shall not be flying on this airline again.
This review is of the extremely poor customer service. It all began in January 2023 when I purchased two RT tickets from Denver to Athens Greece. The first leg of the the trip Denver to Munich was a Lufthansa flight for which I paid 185 for seat assignments Row 18 HK. Fast forward to flight check in on April 29 2023 and my seat assignments are not what I reserved. An hour and half later and finally speaking to a Lufthansa rep and she cannot help me or refund my purchased seats. I am instructed to apply for a refund online after travel has been completed. It is now one week since I have returned from Athens and I have not been able to receive a refund. The online system wont recognize my booking code even though it shows verified and I receive error messages. I have made six calls to customer service with no service at all. I have been disconnected two times and on other calls I am told that the system is down you have to do this online supervisors are unavailable to assist and due to the high call volume I cant get you assistance. The last call ended with the representative telling me to call back in 15 minutes. I wish for this review to focus only on the customer service center. My actual flight experience is another review and equally poor. Lufthansa should be ashamed of all aspects of their service. I will not use this carrier again.
Travelling by Pobeda from Moscow Vnukovo to Krasnodar on Sep 15th. Vnukovo Airport is easy and comfortable. This is also the main hub of Pobeda. Pobeda being a lowcoster does not use jetways and they bring the passengers to the plane by bus. No problem with if it is managed professionally. I was boarding the bus at 1605 not the first one and leaving the bus to board the plane at about 1645. So rather than efficiently managing the boarding they simply bring people to the bus far too early and let the passengers to wait there for next 40 min. or more. As you know there is a very limited number of seats in airport buses. In an overcrowded bus there were elderly people and mothers with a small kids standing all that time and waiting. Pobeda by managing the boarding in this way demonstrates its unfriendly customer attitude. They clearly missed the fact that the whole experience from the flight does not start when boarding the plane and when leaving the plane.
FrankfurtDubrovnik return. Airbus 319320 very new with plenty of room and easy secure seat belts on recent flights Ive had to call for an extension so I know now its the old planes not me. Dropdown screen for preflight and safety explanations. Snack served midflight with choice of soft drinks wine or beer and teacoffee. Return flight diverted to Terminal B which meant a run of 35 mins to my connecting Lufthansa flight from Terminal A to Brussels.
Cape Town to London via Dubai. Flew Emirates on family recommendations and to be honest they were okay but not worth the hype. The 777 with the 343 configuration is uncomfortable and cramped. Asking 20 per leg to select seats is robbery when you are only transiting from one aircraft to another. that would have added 160 to the price of 2 return tickets. The crew were indifferent and did not really communicate with you they were distant I asked for a drink with my meal which never arrived and part of my meal tray was missing but by then I had given up. They seemed disorganised at service times. On 4 flights only had one comfort bag with socks eye mask and toothbrush in. The A380 was a much nicer aircraft and reasonably comfortable and we did have a spare seat next to us. Food was again okay. Overall pay a bit more and go Qatar Airways.
This is my first time with WOW when I saw the 500 fare I checked out reviews and thought it looked fine. I dont mind no meal on a flight not really a fan of airplane food anyway. I thought the connection seemed tight but it was what WOW advertised. So the flight out of Chicago was delayed. No reason was shared no real info it was just delayed by about 2 hours but the flight crew announced over the speaker on the plane. They will hold your connections for you and we will make up time in the air. Well that was a lie dont announce things that arent true. So once we got inside the airport multiple connecting flights were missed so there was a line 3040 people long with 1 only 1 WOW employee giving directions. Really WOW you couldnt do anything to assist all the passengers at that point So after waiting 2030 minutes in the line the lady tells me follow the arrivals signs and an agent will be waiting to direct you. Was there an agent absolutely not. But I did find about 7 other passengers who were on the same connecting flight all wondering around lost wondering what was going on. We were able to piece together some info a few of us received different emails from WOW giving different info. By sharing with each other we realized we could book an airport hotel and they rebooked us on flights the next day. But not one of us had complete info and only by talking to each other could we piece this together. Finally after over an hour someone who worked at the airport not WOW got someone from WOW to speak to us and get a bus to take us to the hotel. We were told be ready for a bus to arrive by 3.30am in the morning to take us to the airport. Was there a bus nope no bus. There were way more WOW stranded passengers at the hotel who arrived after us. The hotel called their shuttle service to come at 4am and take a huge bus full of all the passengers WOW stranded in Iceland and then again at the hotel. Huge thanks to Airport BB. Now the rebooked flight is delayed by how much who knows. Will we ever get to Berlin who knows. Zero trust in WOW and not booking with them again oh and that 500 fare ended up being 775 with seats and carryon luggage. So if you care about getting to your destination in a timely manor and communication when things go wrong I do not recommend WOW.
Paris to Mauritius on May 1st. Had a great experience flight boarded and left on time. The staff were very pleasant friendly and extremely helpful. The food on board was good and the flight attendant came around several time for beverage. The one negative comment I would have to say is the individual screen have seen better days. I understand its an older aircraft but something has to be done about those screen. overall Air Mauritius provided an excellent service and have impressed us. Good job
Perm to New York via Moscow. In 4 days they managed to lose my baggage on the way to and from my destination. Connecting time in Sheremetyevo 3 hours. The telephone they provide on their website and via general hotline for lost baggage in Sheremetyevo are never answered. You get an automatic answer that everyone is busy and you should call later. I tried approximately 50 times in different times never succeeded. Emails are not being answered. At the moment something goes wrong nobody cares.
Alaska airlines we will never fly with you again. All excited to take our daughter who loves flights on her first flight and the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way. We let the woman at the gate know it was her first flight and asked if they still got wings and an opportunity to see the cockpit and the response well its case by case but Ill tell the flight crew. Board the flight no one knew it was her first flight so whatever we make our way to our seats. Daughter who just turned two is now crying because she couldnt see ok no problem we didnt promise anything to her. We had purchased her a seat so she could have some space but she only wanted to be held when the plane took off. Still crying and stewardess who was either having a bad day or clearly has no kids tells us she must be strapped into her own seat. I explained she was crying and would be better for everyone if we could just comfort her she gives a nasty look and says nope strap her in. Wonderful cue hysterical baby sorry everyone around us. At this point my child is crying hysterically borderline throwing up so we pick her up to comfort her we were at a stand still on the ground not even moving or ready for takeoff and here comes stewardess number 2. She clearly sees whats going on and we explain we just need a couple moments to settle her she looks over at stewardess number 1 who shakes her head and tells us we have no choice but to strap her in. So I apologize to everyone around us and my wife and I try to console our hyperventilating daughter who continues to cry inconsolably till we reach altitude and we are able to rip her out of the seat and settle her. First wave of drinks come out and we are completely disgusted with these woman and stewardess number one walks over and tosses a set of wings at my wife full of attitude and says somebodys first flight eh. Laughs like she had enjoyed this whole thing. Total train wreck daughter throws up all over both of us because she was so upset and no one cared. Another family in the row across from us with a baby was completely disgusted these two women were acting the way they were. Oh and just to round out the 5 hour flight from hell the extremely overpriced wifi I paid for to play a movie and settle our daughter would not work. It took barely 1 hour of restarts paid time outs credit card time outs and buffering to get it to barely play movie. The movie timed out twice for now reason and when it finally came back the third time the speaking didnt match the peoples mouths. Tried to open a couple games and those wouldnt work because of the wifi either. Several people around us had the same struggles and some asked for refunds and were just left staring at the seat in front of them. Of the hundreds of thousands of miles I have flown I have never been so disappointed and let down. Pilots who cant be bothered to greet kids. Flight attendants acting angry and vindictive while also apparently enjoying acting that way. No monitors on a 5 hour flight and garbage overpriced wifi instead. I get that expenses are up but dont lower your standards or service too. Alaska used to be a top two airline for me but never again. Alaska 1048 from San Diego to Boston.
Tried for the first time the pay for food option on this airline which claims to be a premium airline. Basically the same experience as on a low cost with the difference it takes ages to have processed finding the ordered products and payment what you want to consume. Clearly cabin crew is still not accustomed with the concept. Still not getting used to having to pay for food in a premium airline.
Travelled from Singapore to Auckland on the 10.25pm flight. Service aboard the flight was excellent. On arrival in Auckland passengers had to disembark by way of mobile stairs. I have to say while being advised to mind our step as we stepped onto the swaying stairway due to wind gusts I noticed there was only one staff member that was there to help with passengers which I felt was a small let down due to the fact it was a full flight. However the staff that was helping passengers was absolutely amazing.
Good flight overall. This can be one of the cheaper options to fly from Dubai to London partly to compensate for the awkward flight times very late nightearly morning in order to line up with the onwards journeys tofrom Brunei using the same aircraft and limited frequency currently only flies thrice weekly. The airline is dry does not serve alcohol which can be an advantage in the sense of avoiding air rage incidents caused by drunken passengers. Priority boarding for reserved seats was adhered to. Two hot meals of good quality were served in the flight the first was a slice of pizza served 40 minutes after takeoff the second was cooked breakfast 2 hours before landing and an amenity kit containing an eye mask and socks was provided to economy class passengers. Inflight entertainment has a lot of options but is not easy to search and navigate and the quality of the sound from the headphones is low. Despite being the very first flight of the day to land at Heathrow Terminal 4 our luggage took almost an hour to arrive this is the airports fault not the airlines.
I asked for a good leg space seat and my offered seating for todays upcoming flight from Manila to Doha is the window even though I am a platinum member in economy I cant have both. I have an exit row good for leg space but an aisle seat.
Flew Air Algerie from Oran to Paris. I do not understand where this airline got 3 stars from 1 should be more appropriate. The cleanliness or rather lack of is a major issue. The newer planes especially are already really dirty food crumbs everywhere seats are not cleaned and toilets a disgrace. Staff are a mixed bunch some are friendly but others have never heard of politeness or friendliness. Languages spoken are Arabic and French you can forget about English. Food is just acceptable nothing more. Flights are usually not on time especially flights later in the day. Legroom is in fact acceptable.
LHRARNLHR with British Airways return 29th and 31st August. Check in online quick as was bag drop at T5 used galleries Sth lounge which Ive always liked. Breakfast on offer at 7am. Boarding quick however the use of a bus to a remote stand always feels odd at an airlines hub newish aircraft with new Club Europe seating first time using this layout and must say felt not much different to economy. Flight away on time service ok with english breakfast on offer. Crew ok. Landed a little early. Return check in quick and easy although 3rd party lounge is just ok flight departed on time lasting 2hr 35min crew pretty nice and the old CE layout on this A320 appeared comfier afternoon tea served which was ok. Flight arrived a little late but on to a stand so no bus trip. Im unsure if Club in Europe is still worth the extra I have a few more BA European flights coming up so will judge once Ive used economy and club once more.
We flew from Lima to Arequipa on one of Peruvians aged 737300s. The planes are in an alleconomy layout with very tight seats still in their Southwest Airlines decor. The airline offers nofrills barebones service by a VERY attractive group of male and female flight attendants. A free drink and snack box with an inedible sandwich is offered. This is the most basic way to travel around Peru. I cant suggest flying this carrier. It is cheap and gets you where you need to go. Dont expect them to run on time either.
Dubai to Hong Kong. I have flown Cathay Pacific for 12 years and the service gets better and better. The ground staff working for CX were very polite and helpful. When we boarded the plane crew greeted us with a smile. I noticed the cabin was spotless everything was clean from tray tables to the bathroom. The menu was very good. I had chicken with rice which was heavenly. IFE was also very good with a large variety of movies. Legroom was very decent and seat was also very comfy and I could sleep well. Overall my experience was amazing. The crew showed passion in their work which you must appreciate.
London to Milan Linate. I landed in London after taking connecting flights from Orange County California to Dallas and then Dallas to London both on American. I landed in London at 115 P.M. This flight did not leave until 630 P.M. I went to the British Airways help desk and asked if I could get on the 300 flight. They told me to go to the gate and wait to see how full the flight was before the flight as I had only one carry one and nothing checked. I went to the gate just before boarding and they told me that it was impossible as I would have had to go to the ticket area at least an hour before to change the ticket. So I had to wait another 3 hours. I have now been traveling for 18 hours. At the gate for boarding they looked at the bag and said I would have to check it. I explained that it is a regulation carry on bag and it was on the last two flight and I have had the same bag on over 30 flights as carry on. I explained that it was on the last to connecting flights and I have been traveling for a long time and did not want to wait a long time for my bags as I will be getting in late. They were very rude and tagged the bag but still gave it to me to carry down to the tarmack and get on the bus to the plane. I decided to carry it on to the plane. It fit easily in the overhead as it has for every other flight there were other bags that were bigger than mine. They actually came on the plane and took the bag off and put in in the cargo hold. If that wasnt annoying enough I could not believe I asked for water to take a pill and they charged me for a bottle of water. They also charged the woman next to me for a cup of tea. I could understand this possible on one of the discount airlines but this was British Airways. To end my frustration it took almost an hour to get my bag as the belt stopped halfway through the process. I am a travel agent and will never book for someone else or myself unless there is no other viable choice.
Possibly the worst mid haul airplane Ive been on. Was booked through Etihad superb airline but got Seychelles instead Frankly it felt like Ryanair or Easyjet. Give it the widest berth Ill even avoid Etihad to avoid the chance of this tin pot airline.
Casablanca to New York JFK via Paris. My bag was supposed to be on board AF Flight 0006 which arrived March 3 at JFK. That was 8 days ago. I have been tracking it from Casablanca to JFK all week. It has been in the Delta baggage claim Terminal 2 for over two days now and nobody seems able to collect it to the Air France terminal and transport it to my home. They say they have escalated the process but the bag still languishes at Terminal 2. I have not had my bag for 9 days. How is this company so inefficient that they cant accomplish this task I have been calling everyday sometimes twice and they say they have it but it doesnt get to me. In Casablanca Air France staff were unhelpful if not rude. At JFK they said it had come in but it hadnt. They are impossible to deal with. I will never fly Air France again. March 11th and I still dont have my bag.
Paris to Mauritius and return in Business class with the family. A good experience even if a somewhat dated plane with angled seats and a dated entertainment system although with well curated but limited selection of films. Charming and attentive cabin crew and very kind to our children without any exceptions on both legs. Okay food and drinks selection at an average business class level. AF lounge in Paris in okay. All in all a good value for money option to Mauritius.
The service was terrible. At the gate they didnt have any speakers to announce boarding zones only a couple of guys yelling at the top of their voices. This naturally led to a lot of confusion and arguments between the people lined up. Seats were uncomfortable. I do not know how these seats are different from other airplanes but me and the people around me agreed that our bottoms and backs were hurting. The seats are just bad. Inflight service was even worse. We received a meal lunch about 1 hour into the flight. After that for the next 6 hours they didnt even offer water We were parched. We tried grabbing their attention with attendant calls. Nobody responded. I even walked over to the galley to request water. They said there will be a beverage service soon which never came. This was outrageous. For 6 hours on a 10 hour flight with no beverages snacks or even water We received another small meal an hour before landing where we requested multiple bottles of water. But most food and water items were over since surprise the crew had mistakenly started serving from the back of the airplane to the front
London Heathrow to Istanbul. British Airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers even loyal ones who have status like myself. The overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline. Galleries South in T5 is large airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the Sunday I travelled. Drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients. Onboard it is similarly tired the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table. Seating is cramped. The cabin crew look dejected and have low morale. Onboard experience the service is no different than flying easyJet in fact I would argue worse. There is no complimentary catering you are subjected to MS sandwiches. It is not cheap and or good value or any better than LCC offerings. Service is slow and took the whole of 4.5 hours of the flight meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle I was even asked to wait until I was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people. The slow service is due to the use of card only payment and also the fact the supplier doesnt allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down. On the return journey its clear BA doesnt care about its European or nonNorth American routes the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy but least the food was decent. Overall if it wasnt for the fact I flew with FF miles and the low tax on redemptions within Europe I would never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline you get better more efficient service on the likes of EasyJet now within Europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed.
Ridiculous flight crew that canceled a flight literally 5 mins after landing. We all waited over 5 damn hours at the airport because the flight crew claimed it would just be a 3 hour delay. They landed and immediately said the flight is canceled until the following day. I missed an important event as well as wasted time and money on transportation back and to the airport. What an incompetent airline and incompetent workers. I called customer care and the lady was no help. All she did was direct me to their website to fill out some form that was going to take months. Not only that she hung up on me without letting me know. Suddenly I was just talking to air. Terrible service terrible airline.
We were to fly from Burbank on Thursday 1117 to Idaho on Avelo Airlines as we arrived at Burbank we received a text saying that our flight has been canceled due to maintenance problems so far I have called emailed and have not heard anything from this company. We tried to book another flight while we were at the airport but to no avail so the 5 of us returned home and are trying to recoup other monies that we paid for such as parking at the airport renting car and most of all ruined a family function that we had planned for months. Also vacation times were used and lost time for work has occurred and no vacation. I will never ever use this airline ever where is the customer service there is none I hope that I get reimbursed and I wont lose my 1000 that I paid for. I will also erase this company name from any of my contacts.
I have been nervously watching my upcoming Swoop flight from Toronto to Kelowna. I just looked at Toronto departures and I found cancelled flight after cancelled flight. And it was around the 3rd flight that I realized all the flights I had seen were Swoop. So I searched Swoop specifically it is currently 115 am on Dec 23 and Swoop cancelled every single one of their flights out of Toronto today. Every one. Including the very late flights flights that dont leave for another 22 hours. Flair One cancellation. WestJet A few out of many. Swoop is the only airline that cancelled all their flights. Swoop is not a reliable airline.
It was my first time flying Turkish Airline and it was a very pleasant journey. The flight I took was from London Heathrow to Taipei via Istanbul. I chose this airline simply because it provided the best routeprice for the date that I had to fly. The staff were all diligent kind and helpful. As well I was surprised to have received the amenity kit sitting on an economy seat. They also gave out a warm hand towel and menu before serving meals which I find very considerate.
This is to address a significant issue experienced by myself and the 17 passengers who were left behind on Flight 745. I had a booking with Avelo confirmation 8J967D for a flight on May 22nd 2023. My girlfriend and I were prepared to leave our home well in advance of the scheduled departure time when we received an email informing us of a 30minute delay. Subsequently we received several more emails indicating further delays a total of eight times. Unfortunately none of these emails provided any information or alerts regarding the closure time of the TSA checkpoint. We arrived ontime at the airport for our rescheduled flight at 1145 pm. To my surprise there was no one present at the Avelo front desk at all. An airport employee approached us and informed us that we had missed our flight because the TSA checkpoint was closed despite there still being ample time remaining. He stated that the TSA had closed at 930 pm even though there was another flight scheduled for departure. Besides on the CHO airport it is clearly stated that The daily closing time is dependent on the airline schedule and delays. More passengers arrived subsequently with some needing to check in their luggage. However there was still no one available at the front desk to assist them. After waiting in line for 25 minutes I managed to reach an Avelo customer service agent over the phone. The lady I spoke with was courteous and assured me that I would be compensated not only for my flight but also for the hotel and any other costs incurred as a result of this incident. Unfortunately she informed me that there was no alternative way for us to be accommodated on another flight. I made an attempt to contact them but unfortunately they changed their words. They simply resorted to using a generic template without addressing any of my specific concerns. It appears that they have a tendency to evade taking responsibility and often attribute the issues to external factors rather than acknowledging and addressing their own problems. In some cases they even go as far as abruptly ending phone calls as if it is a common occurrence for them.
First time long haul from Gatwick to Orlando Sanford with Thomson airways flew out on GTUIH in row 36 as we purchased extra space seat plenty of leg room and seat width was very good. The flight out was excellent crew friendly and helpful bringing round plenty of complimentary drinks etc. Flight back in row 34 on GTUIC was the same. Aircraft was boarded ready to go on time both ways but had slight delay due to congestion at Gatwick and again in return due to a cargo issue. The aircraft are clean and in excellent condition inside with a very good choice of entertainment. I didnt buy into all the Boeing 787 hype beforehand but it is a fantastic aircraft to fly in especially after going long haul on the old 747400. Will definitely use Thomson for my next trip.
My flight in November from SCL to AMS was one of my best flights. The plane was rather new and well maintained. But the best part of the flight was the crew. Polite but chatty and made everybody feel welcome on board. The service was impeccable and nothing was too much for them. Wines Champagne and food were extraordinary.
London to Dubai via Moscow. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the service provided from staff when buying our ticket at Heathrow Terminal 4. The service is second to none. When we got to Dubai was brilliant as per your advice we are welcomed from the immigration and no trouble at all. We cannot thank you enough and staff at Heathrow are an assets to Aeroflot. Definitely will visit Moscow next time with your company
JT683 Lion Air morning flight from Surabaya to Palangkarya. Departed on time. The flight was not full so all passengers were in the plane 15 minutes before departure. Takeoff was smooth and the flight landed in Palangkaraya exactly at 7.50 am but landing was rough.
London to Olbia. Complete confusion. The plane was delayed getting to Sardinia and so we waited but following checkin at Sardinia we were penned into long lines no seats extreme heat and no water in the queues. The airport staff in Sardinia appeared to be overwhelmed. Finally got onto the plane and were now delayed on the tarmac. We are due to depart more than 3 hours after our scheduled departure time but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates. No water provided. I felt unwell but was told they had no glasses so nothing to drink. Numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures. After a second time of asking I was told I could buy a drink once we took off but they have no idea when that would be. They need to abandon the flight at this stage before more people become unwell. Cabin crew just standing there doing nothing but looking perplexed
Rude and incompetent customer service. I had a question regarding one of their policies and not only did they talk down to me like Im a child they gave me false information I checked later with their cabin crew. Everyone I know whos had the displeasure of dealing with Wideres customer service have had roughly the same experience. Its a shame because they sometimes provide one of the cheaper flights in Norway but Id rather pay an extra 10 to avoid this company. The trip itself was ok.
Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar. I had a suspicion that this airlibe was going to be terrible from the outset. No more so than the fact I couldnt even book a ticket online. Tried several cards and browsers and no luck. Couldnt get through to the call centre after waiting ages on a few occasions. In the end I was about to give up and book another airline but the flight times happened to work well for me with Malindo. In the end I had to go to a local booking office to get the ticket. In this day in age you should be able to book a flight ticket with an international credit card which I gathered was the reason why my booking wouldnt work online. Probably not a good idea to book the flight using a 3rd party expedia etc. Yes you will get about the same fare and be able to book online. However it wont include luggage and you wont be able to go onto Malindo afterwards and add it as they wont accept your foreign card. Then you are unlikely to also get through to do it over the phone. So you will be stuck with doing it at the airport. Which I gather from other reviews will cost you a whole bundle of money. Perhaps this is their scam and why they dont take foreign cards. Thankfully I paid for 20kg of baggage in advance at the local airline office. Although this was almost the same as the flight price but way cheaper than at airport. So the flight itself was delayed out of KL. Got on the plane and the entertainment system was down for the whole flight. Then I found that you didnt even get any form of complimentary beverage. Not even water Now being a budget airline I expected to pay for food and snacks and certain drinks. However. to not even come around on a 3 plus hour flight with a drink of water or tea etc is inhumane. You can buy a soft drinkwater but guess what They only accept cash So for someone who is transiting through KL airport there was no cause to have any local currency and I didnt have any other currency on me apart from Sri Lankan rupees where my origin was from which they dont accept The airline delays me the entertainment doesnt work and they dont even give me some water Even for those reasons alone they should just offer something. Anyway they didnt and so if they dont accept credit cards for drinks purchases and I had no cash then I guess I was going thirsty for 3 hours. The extra catch to this whole thing. At KL you cant even bring your own water on board as its not allowed into the gate area due to liquid restrictions and they have the scanners etc at the gate. Even if you buy water in the airport you cant take it past the gate. This is a whole separate issue I guess and with KL airport itself. However it still makes the Malindo policy worse in terms of the availability of water that should be free and thier lack of payment options to get it. Wake up Malindo. Sort out all of these issues. I will never use them again and people should avoid if you dont want to have major hassles from the start to finish of the whole experience
Austrian is regular low cost airline. On time performance friendly crew and relatively new aircraft. Reminded me lot of Laudamotion which is another Austrian low cost airlines. Overall I would expect more from Star Alliance and Lufthansa group member.
Their economy you will get more than a small bottle of water you can expect tasty hot meal and selection of beverages including wine and beer. For me the best European airline. I appreciate their improving service.
Moscow to Cheboksary with Pobeda Airlines. The price was around 50 return ticket 25 for an extra hand luggage. Pobedas website was excellent for booking tickets and what I liked was that all fees and charges were communicated in a very clear and userfriendly way. Checkin at Moscow VKO was done effectively in a friendly manner. At Cheboksary the checkin was a bit messy as airport was very small though still fast and friendly. The planes on both legs were new Boeing 737800s. Although seats did not recline legroom was fine. No food was served during flights but FA offered water at any call. Staff was all about speed and efficiency and were very good at it. All in all a very good lowcost airline.
Recently flew to LA on British Airways and was thoroughly underwhelmed with the experience on the BA A380. I travel regularly in business class on Emirates normally on the same equipment. The BA configuration upstairs is quite cramped and far inferior to other Airlines even to the extent of having to stretch over other passengers to leave your seat. In addition the staff seem preoccupied with their own arrangements and although were fine with me were mildly irritated with the requests of other passengers openly commenting to each other in front of me. The cleanliness of the plane also left a lot to be desired after only a couple of hours into the flight the toilets were disgusting with the floor awash I dont think crew check them on a regular basis. The window seat has side stowage facilities which in my case had a disgusting pale yellow fluid and rubbish in it. When mentioned to crew they did get some paper towels to dry it out but needless to say I didnt use it photo attached. Overall poor value for money.
Outbound from LHR to Washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in Economy all in all wasnt a bad experience modern looking cabin with excellent IFE system food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to Premium Economy. Return flight BA 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight but no worries could relax in the PE cabin boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed how old was the plane The cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadnt had the refurbishment treatment. Leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the IFE system that decided not to work mind you the screen was so small and scratched I doubt I would have been able to watch anything. Cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with after a few words from the Captain we departed. The evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok wine and GT was acceptable about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should I say offered some sort of filled roll. I declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered. I should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special for having spent an extra 400 for the upgrade. BA this experience was a disgrace for a once proud airline never again.
Stansted to Derry. This is a most efficient service with every aspect of it being handled professionally. I love being able to check a large bag in and not having staff say that it is too big too heavy etc. The air stewardess on my flight was so accommodating to people who had difficulties with managing the steps and overall had a lovely disposition. The planes are never overcrowded on this Derry route which makes for a pleasant and comfortable flight.
Gatwick to Vilnius via Riga. Terrible customer service. We was denied our flight to Riga from Vilnius due to delay of their inbound flight from Gatwick. It was explained that we missed our last flight and should go to collect luggage and go to ticket office for travel rearrangement. Lady in reception told that air Baltic offer for us can offer only ground transportation to Vilnius airport. When one gentleman asked for flight next day it was told that there is no chances to stay overnight no available hotels in Riga that night and that all flights from Riga to Vilnius on next day are fully booked. Then after doubts how it can be that all flights and hotels are overbooked in Riga she told that probably the is 1 seat then maybe 3 seats in morning flight but hotel for sure she cannot book and if we wish we can do it on our own money and then apply to refund of 70 EUR. When we started negotiate ground transfer story continue very interesting way it was told that cab cannot bring us to hotelhome address only to drop off in Vilnius airport. After emotional complains why we need to go by cab to Vilnius airport and then back to city by taxi at 5AM she firstly told that it is because our destination is Vilnius airport and we will be delivered right here even if it is after 4 hour drive and no taxi in Vilnius airport at that time. Then after 5 min of emotional discussion she once again changed her mind and told that OK we may take taxi in Vilnius airport and then to submit receipt to refund. When we told that this is stupid that we need to cross all city and then go back she told that ok ok you may ask transfer driver to drop off in your destinations only if this is on way to airport. No consent was given to sign for us just she gave voucher to driver and thats it. Now I have problem with insurance company. I not even mention kindness words used like sorry for inconvenience I will do my best or any provision of refreshments etc. When we finally asked surname name was on card of receptionist she told that this info she is not obliged to provide.So all long story short airBaltic represented as its best Soviet heritage of customer service with Service provider always right and No we cant attitude. If you want this experience you may try to travel with this airline. For me enough is enough I chose airBaltic to London via Riga instead direct flights VilniusLondon with WIZZ and Ryanair because I was expecting more intelligent and kind attitude and paid for it extra 100 EUR per ticket. How naive I was
Every flight we took in British Airways for our two vacation 4 flights had huge problems Always delayed from NY a 5 hour delay in line Computer glitch they were handwriting boarding passes. Another leg check in was botched their issue and we had to stand with the very rude employee who botched it all up and kept trying to call his manager who never picked up for 30 minutes which held up a very long line of checkins. We are here at Heathrow tired and ready for our way home. Already a 1 hour delay no explanation Just read that British Airways had to turn a plane around this morning due to engine issues
Hong Kong to Ningbo. Checking in at the counter wasnt the most pleasant thing of this flight but after that it got much better. Boarding was delayed for half an hour which wasnt a major surprise most flight departing for China are delayed and 30 minutes is considered little. I was the first to board in the Economy class section I was greeted with a nice mile and a good evening they checked my boarding pass and escorted me to my seat they didnt even do that when I was flying business to London which was a pleasant surprise. After that boarding started getting chaotic it was loud people were shouting across the aisles but the crew seemed handle everything properly asking the passengers to sit down on their seats and not blocking the aisle. I needed the loo halfway through boarding and it took me about 2 minutes to get from the middle of the plane to the toilets at the end the crew kindly informed that there isnt any running water from the taps yet and asked if some hand sanitiser and an antiseptic towel would be fine. Takeoff was smooth as any cathay flight is the meal was fine ice cream was offered as a dessert option which was surprising for a short 2 hour flight. The Flight attendants did their job smoothly and smiled whenever I asked for something like they genuinely enjoyed their jobs. The seats were what Cathay Pacific Cathay Dragons partner airline uses on their longhaul planes and featured very good padding and also a personal AVOD system which was responsive and featured enough selections to keep me entertained for this flight.
Cape Town to Johannesburg. Club checkin for our Comair flight to JNB couldnt have been more unfriendly and the agent failed to mention the SLOW lounge. We let her ticket our luggage through to LHR without collecting it at JNB as she said it would work. Well well see. The lounge was frenetic although food and drink were plentiful. The 737800 was a new model although Club seating was the usual Club Europe arrangement. Departure was delayed by 60 minutes but that still left two hours for transfer on to the BA LHR flight. The flight itself was unremarkable and we made up some time. Cabin crew seemed efficient and had a sense of humour. Not at all bad really assuming our luggage catches up with us.
Birmingham to Male return via Dubai. Unfortunately Emirates has declined over the last few years and now I try my best to avoid using them. I had problems both legs of the return journey. Firstly our flight got cancelled from Maldives which caused a lot of stress and losses time and money. They gave some skywards miles as goodwill gesture which were worthless. I have been going back and forth with their customer affairs team but getting nowhere. On the second leg home the service was diabolical never have I experienced such bad customer service. Emirates really need to sort out their customer service.
New York to Delhi via Kuwait. Water Bottle not provided in the flight so every time you want to drink water you have to call the flight attendant and she will bring a small glass of water for you. Flight delayed 1.5 Hr and second time it delayed 12 hr. They forgot my luggage in Kuwait though it had a tag of Delhi. They are not picking my call. Vegetarian food is not available you have to give special order for vegetarian food. Mostly food was halal and pork free. Too much of crowd if you are travelling in economic class you have to be in a long queue for every checkin boarding. Blanket will be provided to those who ask for it. It was WiFi equipped but paid so I dont know how was the speed. For entertainment it had decent number of nice movies. Movies in english Islamic Hindi but subtitles available only is Arabic. Announcement were mainly in Arabic and English.
My wife and I flew from Toronto to Ponta Delgada on Mar 22 2017 and the flight and service provided by SATA was nothing but excellent. The flight left on time food was great. Boarding and retrieving baggage was without a hitch cant say enough good about this airline. We took a SATA prop plane from Ponta Delgada on March 30 to Funchal again smooth transitions on both ends. Great experience.
I was flying back from Zurich to Heathrow after a visit to see my son. We arrived in time at the airport. Check in was quick and friendly. But once we got through security the trauma of BA began. A 2 hour delay on the screen. Why didnt they tell us at checkin Yes they did know as it transpired the flight had a problem earlier in the day. Once the boarding began all was okay until we got on one of BAs old planes with the most sullen crew you could ever meet. No welcome. The seats were hard and uncomfortable. Before taking off the Captain explained the delay had been due to a faulty door. The door had now been decommissioned as not for use and hence some seats were empty. A strange explanation and comforting for anyone who had a fear of flying When the food service came I was asleep but my said they ignored her. When we did arrive at Heathrow T5 we ended up at the C gates so adding another 20 minutes or so. Based on this I will no longer pick BA as a preference. The brand once the favourite airline is no longer.
If you ever have to cancel your flight they will conveniently lose your travel funds and youll never see them again. I spent countless hours sending them the proof that they owed me travel funds and they just said that they couldnt find them and that it was the customers responsibility to keep track. What a joke I sent everything that they had sent me. how can I give them travel funds numbers to research whats owed to me if they never gave them to me in the first place. Customer service is inadequate and in accurate and they do not care if you are owed. If they say they cannot locate your travel funds on their end it then you lose. I will never ever fly Avelo Airlines again and if I am asked by anyone in my area how I like them I will always tell them the full story.
Business Class configuration is unacceptable. The same as Economy Class Besides the seat itself was very uncomfortable small and rigid. The food is decent and the staff three very young girls with the leader not older than 2627 most likely very nice and polite but all in all I do not see a reason for paying Business with nothing in return other than the food for free. I will never fly Joon again.
I flew BA from Heraklion to Gatwick. I bought exit row seats for me and 3 others to sit together with extra leg room. I paid around 150 for that in January. We got to the airport 2 hours before departure queued to check in and was told that 2 of the seats were reallocated to someone else. I asked why. The BA rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed. She then said we should have got there earlier. She wouldnt call BA customer service when I showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch. I was told to email BA and ask them to refund me the seat cost. The flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of plane. She apologised and said shed take our case up with BA customer service. I also sent in a complaint. Today is 17 days with no response and my money still not refunded. Ill never fly with them again.
Osaka to Okinawa. Never again I hope. Even at Osaka airport their gates are far away and seem remote and isolated. The flight crew were pleasant enough there is the low amount of amenities and attention Ive come to expect from an LCC. I never had any doubts about the safety of the flight the plane seemed in new condition and the crew very professional. But at arriving at Naha Okinawa on time I became very frustrated with Peach. Once again I soon found out we were deposited into a far away terminal but this one was even more remote than at Osaka it felt like I was in a hot warehouse. After claiming my bag of course I had to pay to check my 1 bag at least Jeju Air lets you check a bag for free and doesnt make you sweat and wait in some forgotten place there was a long line to get outside. I had no idea what the line was for why we were waiting and why the line of people was not moving. There were no Peach employees anywhere to be seen. After about 10 minutes in line I thought I saw a Peach employee walking by going into an office door so I attempted to call out to her I am fairly certain she heard me and made eye contact with me but went through the door anyway and closed it behind her. A few more minutes passed and I was able to find out from an employee of a rental car company that we were waiting in line for a shuttle bus to take us to the main terminal. I then noticed that there were indeed buses coming but so infrequently that it took at least 30 minutes of standing in the Peach warehouse apparently no AC for it was Hot in there before I and most other passengers were able to board their shuttle to the proper terminal a 5 minute ride packed full still hot. I went on their website today to make a complaint and I could find nowhere any contact information for them only ways to book a flight take your and kiss you goodbye. I will not fly Peach again.
London Heathrow to Chicago in First with British Airways. It was better than my last trip in Club World but having recently come off the back of an extended trip around Asia not with BA one quickly realises how subpar most of the BA experience has become. Airport service at Heathrow distinctly average and economy style. Onboard some staff friendly some surly and frankly lazy. Loos were not checked or cleaned throughout the flight. While I dont fly to dine this was more like pub grub compared to top first class airlines and cost saving is clearly evident. IFE was okay. Trouble is there is no proper competition on this route as US carriers cant be classified in the first class league.
Can an airline be this inefficient From beginning to end AI has given nothing but lousy service and that is being generous. I landed in Delhi at 11pm and my plane to Toronto was supposed to leave at 3.35am. They said that it was delayed and will start at 5am. The staff made a big show of checking documents which started at 3.30am. Our documents were checked three times at least. Just to kill time and to make a show that something was being done There was no order to the boarding We boarded around 4 am and now its 7am and we are still sitting on the plane a closed space with people coughing. In 3 hours no water was even served and besides the initial announcement no updates to the passengers. We are being treated as cattle and not human beings. Theres no courtesy of keeping us in the loop. This is a broken down plane. Nothing works. For a 14 12 hour nonstop flight theres no entertainment. Honestly at this point I wonder if I will get where I need to get alive and in one piece. AI is playing with our lives and is being extremely disrespectful of our time. We have lives and jobs to get to and theres a reason we plan a trip. This is the second time I have flown AI in 6 months for lack of finding any other airline and this is the second time Ive sat in the plane for 4 hours while technical issues are being dealt with I would give this negative stars if the option were available
Flight was 740. We were already in the airport. Suddenly everyone got shock that the flight was move to 1100 in the evening. Boarding time the plane is still no where to be found. 1024 the plane arrived but still need to offload the passenger. So as expected flight again was delayed to 1150 pm. Now its 1115 still the cabin crew are still outside. What a disappointment. This is no justice to the fare we paid. So bad.
London Heathrow to Tel Aviv with El Al Israel Airlines. New 787 with excellent Business class 1x2x1 configuration. The new menu is more like Asian food with a touch of Israeli tastes very interesting and good. Crew team are super professional and nice. Free wifi works well.
Again a highly enjoyable flight with Emirates from Dubai to Zurich. The ground staff in Dubai was very helpful and super efficient. Boarding was very punctual and well organised. Warm welcome from the excellent cabin crew when I boarded and throughout the flight the cabin crew was just lovely and very attentive. Seats on the A380 are so comfortable and the IFE is just brilliant. There was just not enough time to watch all the new releases. The food was absolutely delicious I had salmon and saffron rice the service impeccable and the flight overall just amazing. Emirates is just the best airline I have flown with and I am looking forward to my next trip with them later in the year.
There were no manned counters available for economy class at all. Even 2.5 hours before the flight no staff were available to assist us and staff in Perth airport were not familiar with the self check in kiosk issues. We took a good 2 hours to resolve our check in issues as there was a long line of people waiting in line as all of us had issues checking in via the online kiosks. There were only 2 staff walking around who arrived only 2 hours before flight. We were juggling the queue our toddler baggage and when we finally printed our boarding pass we had to lug everything and our toddler who was cranky at this point from all the waiting and standing and queueing and then self check in our baggage one at a time. It was the worst service ever. Also the captain announced that there will be no wifi for that flight.
The service was good and the flight attendant was excellent. If memory serves her name is Eman. She was an amazing flight attendant and she helped me a lot with my aunt because my aunt needed some extra assistance and Eman was the one who helped her. Her service left a great impression on us which reflected on Qatar Airways in the end and made it as one of the best airways in the world.
There are many things wrong with this airline. First their boarding process at JFK was an absolute mess as they did not have boarding groups so everyone was rushing and pushing to get into the plane. The plane is very outdated and dirty with no WiFi connection even for long flights. Of the dozens of airlines Ive flown on Egyptair has the worst cabin crew. They dont engage with passengers and always seem to have an attitude. When serving water coffee or tea they do not bother to ask every passenger. They also do not stay on top of safety protocols and I caught three of them playing games on their phones when they shouldve been getting passengers situated. Lastly they failed to deliver every bag for passengers on the leg from CAI to LOS as they only loaded bags for passengers who flew that same route the day before. Apparently this was because of a load issue that wasnt even addressed to us until much later on. Dont even bother contacting customer service because they will not respond or theyll only send an automated message. This is a disgrace of an airline.
Avoid this airline at all cost. Missed a flight from Minneapolis to Chicago because the first leg was delayed due to weather. Sun Country kept my sold my 5 seats to someone else and could not have been less interested in helping us rebook. Rebooked on Southwest the next day for 1200 for 5 tickets and spend 350 on 2 hotel rooms. Sun Country offered me 25 per ticket for our missed flight. How is this company in business
This is the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I flew with British Airline on August 21st 2022. I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation. When I did not receive any update on my lost bag I filed a claim for compensation and that was on September 11th. Since then I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and theyre not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle. Very unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA.
Paris Beauvais to Vienna. They have a deadline before flight when you need to do online checkin otherwise you have to pay 55 extra for each passenger. Flight delayed 2 hours. Seats were uncomfortable. Really dont recommend to fly with Laudamotion.
BNE to POM POM to Mt Hagen and return. Was very impressed with service. Cabin staff could not be faulted and very obliging and friendly.
BA is getting more like a budget airline every time I fly. I now have to pay 15 to choose a seat when I book in and then wait an unreasonable time to board. Fast track were called forward first and about 80 of the passengers went that way. When I finally got to the front I asked if all the fast track were fast track and was told no but we are not allowed to make them go to the general boarding queue so what is the point. Easyjet and Norwegian are far better than BA for short haul and any Middle East airline for long haul. Try harder BA please
Pathetic service. I have booked 9pm flight from Nagpur to Pune. They have rescheduled the flight at 1030 pm. It means I will land in Pune around 12 pm. As an alone woman I dont feel safe to travel further in Pune because I have to go to Talegaon. The airline is not providing me any solution. They should provide a full refund in such cases.
Horrible experience for both legs of a round trip from Boston to Lisbon via Ponta Delgado with SATA Air Azores. A two hour layover became five hours without any communication or information shared be the airline to its passengers. Warning the cheap comes out expensive. Dont fly this airline.
First time with Saudia Airlines totally different between the first leg AmsterdamJeddah with the second Jeddah Lahore. I fly with Saudia because I belong to Skyteam Alliance and Im a Platinum pax so I have a lot of benefits. AmsterdamJeddah with B787 in ECO Ground staff very kind in Schipol and she put us in the exit seats that means a lot of legroom. The service was good doesnt stand out especially if you compare with other Middle Eastern airlines. But a little better than American or European airlines. Seat ok with footrest entertainment ok food ok a little plus with amenity bag with earplugs eyes mask and socks. Of course no alcholic drinks. Flight Attendants were kind and ok. In Jeddah transfer nice and new airport very clean and everything is new. For connecting flights you should pass other security control that was a little bit messy between the line for normal pax and the SkyPriority line. Luckily had a lot of time to transfer. JedddahLahore with B777 was totally different. We upgraded biding system Aircraft looks old. Flight Attendants looked tired and disorganized but very kind because C class. The most important was that I could sleep a couple hours. Food on demand but was not really special. Will I fly again with them probably yes if the price is ok and of course will still be in the Alliance.
Words can not express how badlyrun this airline is especially after a natural disaster. Booked medical trip to Miami on Fri to pick up critical medicine unavailable in Nassau. Hurricane changed course on Wed and hit Bahamas on Thurs. By Wed noon all offices were shut and supermarkets empty of stock. In their rush Air Bahamas forgot to update their flight schedules. I had the joy of trying to convince the booking agent in the US that my intended flight very early on Fri morning would not fly because they checked and the web server gave them normal status for this flight. Urging them to check with the weather station was a fruitless exercise. Hurricane hit Thurs morning went to airport at 5 am Fri. Told to come back at 9am when flights would resume. Came and was told that I could catch a plane to FLL at 11am. Thought that this was sufficient time. Plane took off after noon and took hours to get through US Customs. Barely made it to the pharmacy before it shut during the weekend. Coming back was another story. Supposed to fly out on Fri night. Had to stay Fri night at dodgy hotel at my own expense. Spent all of Sat going from one gate to another having to go through security each time. No meals or drink provided by airline. Finally late Sat night we got news that we could board a flight to Nassau. All lined up and then told we could not board because someone forgot to turn on the landing lights at Nassau airport. Another night at a bleak hotel at my expense. Returned early Sun and spent another day going from gate to gate trying to get on a flight. Finally around midnight a flight was available. Spoke with people sitting in that particular lounge they were waiting since 6am. Gate agents worked furiously to get everyone aboard if I felt sorry for anyone it was them. Took off around 130 and landed around 2am to a almost deserted airport A security guard at Nassau airport asked me which flight came in I told her BahamasAir. She did not look surprised she told me that they regularly come in that late. Complained to Bahamasair where I was passed from one person to another until I was given the email of one of the managers sent her an email but of course no reply.
Manchester to Lahore via Doha. The flight from Manchester to Doha on October 25th the airline was clean but my son who is 5 years old was given the meal the same time as me then after food was given they took time to collect the tray from. The rest of the flight was okay onward flight to Lahore wad good. The flight from Lahore to Doha was a delay with no explanation the aircraft was quite warm and smaller and dated. When arrived Doha there was no details on the board of which gate to go to but a friendly Qatar women who told us that we had 40 min to go gate e2. The service was really good clean and space was good and cool temperature flight from Doha to Manchester was good.
Took flight 0B1216 and at the gate we were forced to pay an additional 35EUR for each luggage because the lady at the counter decided it was oversized. They did not measure it with those iron templates that most reputable airlines use. On the boarding pass it is clearly printed one piece of luggage of maximum 10kg and 40x30x20cm free of charge but they simply ignored this and decided the size and weight just by looking at it. Oh and on the payslip they put lastminute ticket not a single reference to oversized luggage which again is a sketchy practice. A company that does not respect what they themselves printed on the boarding pass and charge you at the gate is not a reputable one in fact is the worst experience ever. We paid for 3 cabin luggage additional 105 EUR. Practically this airline just made the money for another seat by this unclear practice.
Had to connect via Trinidad to a flight to Toronto. Flight delayed and they did not even have the courtesy to make an announcement that the flight was delayed when a passenger goes up to ask the status of the flight she gets told It leaves when it leaves These flight attendants need a major attitude adjustment.
SINSGN. Price was excellent. Checkin and boarding was easy. Flew on an A320. Flight attendants seemed in a bad mood. Seat was uncomfortable little legroom no IFE and not enough recline. Food was extremely cheap but it wasnt really filling it was good though. Bad presentation of food looked like it was a frozen dinner.
Madrid to Singapore via Doha in economy class. Crews professional but robotic. Seats onboard entertainment and meals are all fine. Wifi expensive and limited. Leased A350 from LATAM on MADDOH sector was a step down from Qatar Airways own A350 product and first time that Ive been so hot on a flight. Ticket prices and schedules are often competitive at least for the two ultralastminute trips Ive purchased this summer. You get what you pay for perhaps which is just fine but I dont understand the 5star hype.
Flight from Gatwick to Barbados. Check in and business lounge were good. It looks like they had added champagne to the self service drinks which is a positive. Breakfast was good. Flight left on time boarding well run. I have not flown in their economy cabin for a while and it seems ok. New configuration but that does come with Panasonic IFE system which is way better than the old Rockwell Collins systems. Food was fine and service friendly.
To check in I found the economy class queue was clearing much quicker they said the business lounge was closed and gave me 70 voucher that no shop in the Sydney airport food court accepted then they send me on a wild goose chase to find their business lounge in Qatar as no one knew where it was located and was sent on multiple occasions to the wrong lounge. The quality of my food was disgusting with limited options for vegetarians.
The worst airline in the world our trip was on August 29 they canceled the flight at the last minute they offered an alternate flight almost until the next day without giving security of the connection in Panama collecting the luggage was a nightmare the lady at the counter He did us the favor of transferring us to United Airlines because we needed to reach our destination the same day United Airlines charged us for the full baggage 160 money that to date I have not been able to recover there is no direct telephone number to make the claim only via email and every time I send an email they tell me to wait 19 business days for the refund of the money and from 10 to 10 we already go for 1 month and no money. La peor Aerolinea de Mundo nuestro viaje fue el 29 de agosto cancelaron el vuelo a ultimo minuto ofrecian un vuelo alterno casi hasta el dia siguiente sin dar seguridad de la conexion en Panama recoger el equipaje fue una pesadilla la senorita del counter nos hizo el favor de trasladarnos a United Airlines porque necesitabamos llegar a nuestro destino el mismo dia United Airlines nos cobro el equipaje completo 160 dinero que hasta la fecha no he podido recuperar no existe un numero de telefono directo para hacer el reclamo unicamente via correo electronico u cada vez que envio un correo me dicen que espere 19 dias habiles para el reintegro del dinero y de 10 en 10 ya vamos por 1 mes y nada del dinero.
I would have been flying to Cuba at the end of March. However your incompetent staff neglected to inform when switching the names on the itinerary the seat would be lost with no way of regaining it back. Worst airline ever. Will never use again as now my what was vacation is now non existent. With a lot more monetary loss than what was refunded. Poor customer service.
Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Haneda. Another great flight with AirAsia this time with AirAsia X their long haul company and it was fantastic I could not recommend it enough low fare great onboard service. I would recommend booking a seat at the rear of the aircraft if youre a couple as the configuration in economy thins from 3x3x3 to 2x3x2 and I was very happy here.
Online booking not bad we booked the day before departure the reservation didnt transfer to the checkin system so we couldnt checkin online and possibly save some money on baggage fees the Flight was on time onboard service was fine with a coupe of water runs during our 4.5 ish hour flight. Information online hard to find some important information we had a total of 4 bags first 2 were included for free the other 2 were overweight and we knew we would have to pay for them some other airlines would just charge overweight fees for the second bag and you can find the information on their website. Sunwing charged us the second bag fee of 90.00x2 for the overweight bags and then 115x2 for the same overweight bags like I said we knew we had to pay we possibly would of have made different plans if we could have found a more clear policy on baggage fees and how they are applied.
This is a summary of several flights I have taken on AIX on the DubaiPuneDubai route. These flights were at a very convenient time during the day. Now they have been shifted to the early hours of the morning which makes it less convenient though still better than driving BOMPNQBOM. All the flights I have taken so far have been smooth and excellent takeoffs landings and en route. Service is generally excellent and they surprisingly serve a small snack with unlimited water. I have invariably requested and obtained emergency exit seats with ample legroom. Toilets are clean again surprisingly but smell a bit. The main thing that needs to be improved is the maintenance of the cabin. The carpets are worn and the leather seats need refurbishing. The interior of these 738 aircraft need a good scrubbing. But other than that AIX does well on this route.
My 87 yearold mother and myself have done this same trip 3x And each time we have been serviced by Patricia from Mahlon Sweet Airport in Eugene. She is the best agent you have. She made sure we had everything we needed my mom requires wheelchair assistance so flying is especially stressful She helped us through every check point and even took some pictures as we boarded the plane. She is truly an asset to Horizon Air and Alaska Airlines.
Heathrow Galleries lounge overcrowded and under staffed. Tables covered in used plates and glasses which staff were not clearing. Many empty dishes at the buffet. Unacceptably bad. The Dreamliner was comfortable but disappointing in a new aircraft to find that there is still a lack of easy access storage space and shelves next to the seat. As ever a pre loaded tray with ill fitting tablecloth plonked in front of you. Food service more a Premium Economy product than club. No window blinds but a gimmicky and slow system which dims the Windows and was rather unsatisfactory. Overall a mediocre performance from BA which needs to up its business class game particularly on new generation aircraft.
London to Colombo via Doha. British Airways and Qatar Airways are in Oneworld but they are worlds apart. Having flown BA Business numerous times they are disappointing BA lounges even first class are seriously third class contrast this with my first flight on Qatar Airways and it was literally amazing. Qatar Airways London lounge is first rate seriously good food table clothes table service friendly professional staff and they even have magazines you want to read. When you get on the flight to Doha the cabin is awesome Q class means you essentially have small area to yourself. Food on the plane on a par with Emirates and the whole flight and approach of the staff really good. I am shortly flying business on BA to Toronto I will report back on it but am not optimistic. I have been spoilt by Qatar Airways The thing they need to improve is their entertainment.
I was traveling from Mexico City to Tokyo Narita. Fight deperture 20 mins delay. Ground staff not helpful in Mexico City airport. Its a 1430 hours flight but didnt have wifi but have many movie and games. Cabin crew are best I think in the world. Excellent behaviour polite. Al time they come and ask need anything. Really great in flight service. I did not order any food before my flight departure and they served me chicken and rice. Business class seat fully lying bed 180 degree. Flight arrive 15 mins before of scheduled arrive time.
Los Angeles to Bangkok via Tokyo. Absolutely fantastic experience on this airline. My girlfriend and I flew to Bangkok Thailand. Food was served every few hours hot and tasty for airline food. Stewardesses were courteous kind and had not a single hair out of place. We were disappointed that the return flight was serviced by United. The immediate change in enthusiasm service and courtesy was very obvious. I highly recommend ANA to anyone traveling to Asia.
What an absence of 2 years has made. Reservation units Almost non existent. Mostly the website or the app. Customer Care just 1 number to dial. I tried 5 times and each call it lasted more than one hour before i finally hang up the phone. I never got the chance to actually speak to a human . Online chat the same deal. It takes at least a good 70 minutes before the chatbot passes the message to a real human being. If you key in from the chatbot list of FAQs those simple answers are the same from what you find on the website not a single extra detail more. Also watch out for number measurement and the weight of your luggage. Cathay implement new strict baggage rules 111. One cabin one checkin and one small hand carry for economy class. Want to get 2 checkin luggage you can but at an additional cost. Cathay forgot to load my vegetarian meal. In flight music and TV is very limited. It is that bad. Some of the crew that was mostly has this can do attitude before now suddenly has the budget airlines incapacity. Poker face less attentive and trying to avoid interactions as much as possible. Most of the shops in the airport are close. Hope you do not wait long for your transit.
Astana to Almaty. Staff was polite and the plane seemed new. I hope it will continue to work like this. After long stagnation in Kazakhstan aviation industry this was like fresh air even not considering the price of the flight. Only inconvenience was lack of credit card payment support only cash support.
London to Sydney via Doha went without hitch and I was happy with the seat service lounge etc and would happily have given a 910 rating for this airline. However on the return from SYD to LHR there was a technical problem with the aircraft and after sitting in our seats for two hours the flight was cancelled due to the 11pm curfew at Sydney airport. Total chaos as we had to reenter immigration reclaim baggage and pass through customs eventually ending up in the check in area with only four staff members attempting to deal with all 450 passengers and no separate queue for business and first class passengers. After waiting in line for two hours I was allocated a hotel room and told that Qatar Airways would contact me by telephone with details of onward journey. Finally arrived at hotel at 2.15am. By 10am the following morning I had heard nothing and was due to check out of hotel by 11 together with other passengers who had heard nothing. Numerous calls to the number given for the airline were unanswered and I eventually decided to check my booking online and found that I had been rebooked on a Qantas flight leaving that afternoon. I made my own way to the airport and checked in with no problem but to date now ten days later I have had no communication from Qatar Airways. I appreciate that there can be technical difficulties but the total lack of customer service is not what one expects from an airline.
They lost my luggage. They are giving me no updates. Cannot reach out to them in anyway. Also very rude staff very unprofessional. I absolutely do not recommend.
Generally very impressed with Emirates flying from Hong Kong to Arla via Arlanda Sweden. Efficient check in. Seat has good space AVOD works from boarding to leaving plane. Good choices. Food good drinks on request and brought with a smile. Plane incredibly clean they have 2 designated cleaners on flight On 777 to Arlanda again good service food and space. Emirates have a lot of crew and it really makes a difference. Some tricky demanding pax excellently handled by Crew. I particularly appreciate the 2 meal over 6 hour flight service. Loads of drinks runs in between. One of the best economy carriers.
Bangkok to Manchester via Dubai. I bought a ticket online through a third party agent and it was not until we had paid and received our eticket that we found out the agent jad booked a Special Business Class ticket with several restrictions. No lounge. No air miles. No fast track. No pick up. No seat reservation until 48 hours before flight. Very unhappy. No way would we have purchased this ticket. Outward flights first leg A380 crew were so busy. Meal overcooked. Second leg A330 with excellent crew. Could not fault. Return flights BKK to Dubai on an A380 with good crew. Dubai to Manchester A38 was horrendous. Children in Business class and screaming baby for virtually all 7 hours. It is wrong that young children should be allowed in this cabin. It was like a nursery. The crew apologised but it was not their fault. Drinks service was good but the food was average. We will never fly with Emirates again.
This review relates to very poor customer service from QANTAS frequent flyer. I submitted evidence for a flight with Royal Air Maroc several months ago and QANTAS have not updated my points. QANTAS broke data protection and sent me via email the details of another customers booking what is going on with this department I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years and so this is very disappointing. I would rate this department with a zero
Insel Air flight from Miami to Manaus via Curacao started boarding 20 min late. The airplane was not the newest or most hightech and it was hard to hear the staff announcements because the sound equipment makes a lot of noise. However for the amount that I paid for the ticket the staff was very helpful. The service during the flight was excellent with complimentary food which is rare for a 4hours flight candy and beverages they stopped at my seat twice. If you are taking the flight from Miami to CentralSouth America I suggest you fly during the day. My flight was in the afternoon and I had the experience of seeing the Miami Coast as well a lot of the Caribbean Islands. The companys magazine is made to take home. Beautiful pictures nice articles in Spanish and in English and a lot of useful travel tips. The seats are old style therefore your body will never be squeezed between your seat and the seat in front of you plenty of space to relax. They also had an onboard raffle.
Bangkok to Hong Kong. The really good thing about Hong Kong Airlines is that their prices are fairly reasonable and it remains that way even till a day or two before departure which makes last minute flying with them great. Also they do not charge a premium on oneway tickets i.e. The cost of a one way ticket is roughly half the cost of a return ticket so it really helps when flying multiple destinations. Other than that it is quite an average airline with average legroom belowaverage food service average IFE etc. This certainly isnt my first time flying with them and theyre a justmeetingexpectations airline on the whole. I appreciate and would recommend them for their flexibility especially for a lastminute traveler around Asia.
So we asked for an upgrade to business class from premium economy which we bought a year ago so they said they will try and after 6 days of nothing they change our flight tickets and downgrade us to economy even though we bought premium. I am very upset and disgraced not going to do international travel with them again.
FRATUNFRA Pretty worn cabin and cramped seating. Food okay. Staff a bit nonchalant and not too serious about their position as hosts. But on time and relatively good value for money.
We flew from Santiago de Chile to Calama and return and had a good flight. Crew attentive and service good. One of us wanted an extra glass of wine and no problem there either. On arrival a piece of luggage was missing but has been returned the very same day by Sky to our hotel 100km further in San Pedro de Atacama.
14714 TrinidadSt LuciaLGW Club. On the way down from St Lucia BA has an inexplicable outdated crew change. They are the ones from the previous days flight having a two day holiday in St Lucia. Check in at POS is usually unprofessional trinistyle. BA shares a lounge which has a colonial style dress code so I had to nip to the loo to change from my shorts to trousers left on time for the 45min trip to St Lucia where the bulk of holidaymakers board back to LGW. I was positive as I heard the new POSSt Lucia cabin crew ask each other if they wanted a beer They then landed in St Lucia and were busy saying goodbye to each other and the incoming new crew but not saying goodbye to the departing POSSt Lucia passengers St LuciaLGW with new crew. Girl came around with newspapers and I said FT please which she had in her hand but she had no clue what the FT was Did not dare ask for top up to the one glass of bubbly as it is clear as soon as the various jobs are done by various designated crew thats it. New male wash bag is a laugh so I asked for the female wash bag which actually is slightly better. Flight got very cold and I asked for an extra blanket. Told politely but firmly sorry yet there were loads in overhead lockers which I found later. The point about most BA flights these days is to expect nothing and when u get the odd staff member who actually does that extra to consider it as a bonus.
We booked these Cape Air flights to get to Bimini island Bahamas. We were very excited to be landing on and leaving from The water. Weather on our first flight was to bad too much wind so we had a delay And were Forced to land on ground. The seaplane service from Bimini left from the airport again instead of on the water even though it was a Beautiful sunny day And the competition had not problem starting from the water. We Saw 2 planes coming in And leaving from the water without any problems an hour before we left. This was a huge disappointment. We heard that they hardly ever land or leave from the water Please be aware of this when thinking of booking a seaplane flight. Landing in FLL was far from main buildings but a shuttle was waiting for us to take us to the terminal. The service desk and pilots are very friendly and helpful but we wont book a seaplane flight at Cape Air again.
Cape Town to Los Angeles via Paris CDG. So this was the first time that Ive flown Air France and Im not entirely sure how I feel about it. I cant exactly say why I was expecting more but I was. Boarding was efficient and fairly prompt and we got away on schedule. After take off a drinks service was completed followed by dinner and then one more drinks run. I was sat at seat 40a changed my seats at check in I prefer a window seat. Cabin crew were nice enough could have done with another drinks run and the cabin was super clean. The seat was AWFULLY uncomfortable theres something about the way its positioned one cant quite get ones legs straight out under the seat in front. This makes for all sorts of contorted positions throughout the flight and a charming game of leg olympics with the strange man seated in the seat next door. Connection in Paris was quick and well done flight from Paris to LAX was torture. Probably more down to the flight before. Service was arguably better on this flight though and the crew WAY friendlier. It took ages to get luggage at LAX though. All in everything was ok. I cant really think of anything that stood out. In flight entertainment was not what one would expect from Air France but it was ok. I would fly them again but only because of the ease of connection from CPT to the US.
Flight was leaving at 23.15 and after an hour and a half flying had to get back to airport due to a medical emergency of a passenger. Upon landing we were left inside the plane in the tarmac until 415 am and told to deplane and pick up our luggage and flight would be cancelled. Zipair did not take responsibility for the passengers and just left everyone to sort themselves out at 5am even families with small children their reply was oh there are many hotels in Bangkok. When these situations have occurred to me always airline took to hotel specially once we had already left ground. They didnt offer anything at all at the time... Flight was rescheduled for the next day at the same time.. upon checking in at 10pm or so they offered a meal voucher of 300THB as compensation... couldnt they have given the voucher in the morning and not just an hour before leaving. Will not recommend to anyone
I took a round trip of Beijing to Pyongyang Il62 and Tu154 aircraft and the experience was to say the least memorable. As I was sat quite far back in the Il62 it was right next to the engines and Ill never forget the feeling of impending dread and doom as we descended down to Sunan Airport. We landed safely. The food was satisfactory with chicken curry beef with rice some melonesque vegetable bread and dessert. Seats were nice but it was slightly cramped. The luggage space was limited and there was no cover to prevent it from falling off. There were North Korean magazines and a North Korean newspaper Pyongyang Daily up for grabs too on a meal cart. The return to Beijing was on the Tu154 sitting a few rows behind Business class the flight was very comfortable. We did feel hungrier this time as there was no food service coupled with delays hovering over Beijing due to busy traffic at the Airport.
Los Angeles to Bangkok via Shanghai. Outbound flight was ok. Inbound flight was ok until I arrived at LAX. I found that my luggage was damaged. The problem with this Airline is when you call 18555895530 you will get the worst customer service experience ever. Its so bad that it supercede the entire experience you had during the flight and this will make you decide not to book with this airline again. First when you call this number 50 chances you will get busy single. Second when the line finally went thru you will have at least 30 minutes wait time. Third when you get to someone who finally talk to you the rep is not helpful and will tell you something like I cant help with anything you need to go to website and file the claim or I cant wait on the phone you need to hurry up. Keep in mind that I wait 30 mins before I get to the rep. Finally when I went on the website to file the claim about damage luggage I got nothing. No email confirmation no response no nothing Its been 2 weeks and I have not heard from anyone from China Eastern. Its just like my complete went disappear in cyber space. Its obviously that this airline has no customer service.
We queued for checkin for 30 minutes staff were very good. A chaotic and slow boarding process at the gate but when we entered the jet bridge it was very calm and welcoming with staff being very attentive and informative. We had a problem with our star alliance flight the night before as it was cancelled so we were reallocated this flight. Singapore Airlines gave us the front economy seat which had more leg room than any other flight. It was on time and meals were served soon after take off meals were good as well as the rest of the flight
Bologna to Tokyo via Istanbul. We could do the online check in only 24 hrs before and when we coul do it it was only for the first flight from Bologna and not the other from Istanbul because it was 24 hrs before. We had no chance to choose meals. During the flights we had no choice for the meal because it was already finished once crew arrived at our seat. My monitor was not working I asked few times unduccessfully. After 4 hours I had it working after asking again. Crew could have been more smiling and reactive to our requests.
BA25 Aug 8th LHRHKK. Club World. Upper deck. Overall a good flight. The service was a bit robotic. Pre departure drinks offered. Main and breakfast served. For the main course I opted for the healthy light meal which was tasty and just what I wanted as I was trying to avoid a heavy meal before bed. I was surprised at the limited wine selection Two whites and two reds. I had a NZ Sauv Blanc which was tasty but connoisseurs may have felt restricted by choice. The staff were overall very pleasant and happy to help when asked but just werent proactive. Passengers myself included were having to ask for things that should have been attended to without request. They seemed 5 minutes too slow for drink rounds meal service etc. This is a small complaint however as I managed a solid 7 hours of sleep and the overall experience was good. The entertainment system on the A380 is much improved and is as good as any I have flown VSSG etc. The window seat is certainly more private and feels much more spacious with the storage compartments under the windows and I would recommend these especially over middle seats. All in all a solid business class but still lagging behind the likes of CX or SG primarily because of service and seat layout. There is a Britishness to the product which still makes me smile.
Flew New York JFK to Paris CDG via Istanbul. Long Transatlantic flights can be tough but with Turkish Airlines the experience is always top notch. Both flights were on time. Meal service was exceptional for todays airline standards plus the amenity kit in economy class with socks slippers toothpaste and lip balm in it is a nice touch. Wide variety of inflight entertainment from all over the world. Cabin crew were caring courteous smiling and always professional. Keep it up Turkish Airlines
Amsterdam to Seoul in business class. The seats are ok and good enough for a 222 configuration. The food was excellent especially the Korean food that was served very authentically. English speaking of the cabin crew was not sufficient for an international flight. This should be improved to let the customer better communicate with the crew. Nevertheless cabin crew compensate that by high attention and very short response time. Infotainment was bad choice of movies was very limited from the point of view of an European.
This is the absolute WORST experience I have ever had on an airplane. We left Montreal on a short flight to Toronto to catch a connection back to Chicago. After supposed weather delays we were diverted to Sudbury Canada sat on the runway deplaned got back on the plane sat on the runway again and flew back to Toronto. While waiting in Sudbury we were informed that our flight to Chicago had been cancelled with no explanation from Porter as to what we were supposed to do. We were booked for a flight to Chicago on January 5th though 5 days later stuck in Toronto with hotel and all other expenses not compensated for at all. We had to get a hotel and pay another airline to take us back home at a huge expense. I cannot believe that there was nothing done to accommodate passengers or give any help in getting them to their next destination. I will NEVER recommend this airline or fly with them again.
I booked my Turkish Airlines flight from San Francisco to Vienna via Istanbul and was nervous by the mixed feedback. But after 4 different flights 4 different planes 4 different crews all international I can say I was fairly pleased with Turkish Airlines. Seats were more or less ok each head rest had its own USB so thats a plus food was average and I thought the staff was fairly friendly. Their English was eh but if youre leaving the states anyway its really a moot point by then. I believe most of their flights are routed through IST which I found an easy airport to navigate. Id feel comfortable with a short layover here like an hour if thats a concern for anyone.
Dusseldorf to Beirut. We were supposed to go from Dusseldorf to Beirut on May 17th at 21.10 with Germania. At the gate we took a bus to the airplane. While transfering us the bus hit a cement poll and we had to wait for another bus to take us. On the plane we waited around 30 minutes then we were asked to go back to the bus because of a technical problem and to wait in the bus. Once in the bus they took us back to the airport where no one from Germania was present to guide us. We reentered Germany by cancelling our Exit and were asked to go to the baggage belt. There the steward came to inform us that there will not be any flight tonight and that they wont take us to hotels instead we will sleep in the airport and that there might be a plane the next day but this isnt confirmed. After that the airport security brought camping bags and gave each one a 15 Euros voucher for a McDonalds meal. Then everyone from Germania and the aiport staff dissapeared. At 6am in the morning we called the airport staff asking if there were any flights and they asked us to go to the check in for a flight at 8.10. As a summary I have never ever been treated this way. We were left to sleep in the airport like animals. The way they treated us was unacceptable. Its the first and last time I will use this airline.
Flight was delayed both ways by many hours. Poor service for the same price as other airlines like IndiGo. No wifi or other amenities to compensate for terrible service.
Curacao to Port of Spain with Insel Air. My flight was cancelled three times. Then they schedule the flight at 3am to avoid paying hotel. When you get there at 1am its closed with a notification that the flight is scheduled to 8am. When you come back at 5 AM the flight is overbooked and they transfer you to a flight which again is scheduled at 3am the following day to avoid paying for hotel. The chance for departure well tomorrow will show..
HAMSTR. Ground staff at Hamburg were pleasant and everything was swift on ground. A319 aircraft on this route was nearly 50 full. Legroom is acceptable and enough information was given by captain. Aircraft landed 5 minutes late and I had a tight connection for further travel by train. I had checked in a piece of luggage and feared that I miss my train connection but luggage arrive on belts in Stuttgart airport very quickly and I did make my connection. Snacks and drinks onboard are very expensive. All in all a good experience for the price paid.
20220152322015. Flight KM 612 to Rome KM 613 to Malta. I have flown with Air Malta from Malta to Rome Fuimicino and return to Malta. The flight was OK but food was very poor. The service which was provided in Rome was very bad at the checkin the machine did not know how to fill in the boarding pass normally Be aware a lot of students are flying on this route and they make a lot of noise especially during boarding.
5 months later and still no refund for cancelled flight. I get that covid is an issue but 5 months is disgusting. Spoke to them and incredibly unhelpful and wouldnt even tell me who I was speaking to. Will never use again. Stick with reputable airlines.
SkyWest does not honor American ExpressDelta free baggage deals. They are the only carrier in and out of some destinations like West Yellowstone. As a result even if you get your free checked bag from your original departure locationDelta flight you wont get it on the way home. The SkyWest ticket counter employee at West Yellowstone actually thought it was funny. She laughed at me when I complained. This was a Delta flight operated by SkyWest.
Disappointing and frustrating from start to finish. Took hours to check all passengers in at Sydney Airport. No one was notified about a priority line for those who had already done online checkin nor was there signage. We were told by the employee checking us in that we should have waited in that line. She was not a VN Airlines employee. For the whole flight most peoples inflight entertainment was not working at all or otherwise malfunctioning to the point that it could not be used. Staff were not able to offer an explanation other than to reset the screens over and over again no apology or acknowledgment given. This was also the same experience on my return flight 7 days later. Leg room is reasonable for economy but the seating was hard and uncomfortable. Webbing behind the seats that holds things is extremely tight and cannot fit anymore stuff in there so the extras they give like a bag with slippers blanket pillow bottle of water etc. you just have to figure out where to place. Some peoples chairs leaned back way more than others and it was very hard to get them to go back and forward.
Luckily WestJet had a flight the same night so I could get to my destination. The online system was unavailable the agent could not speak English very well at the airport and no one would answer a phone call for help. Choose a different airline if your time is valuable and you dont want to miss a day catching another flight.
Dalian to Bangkok via Fuzhou. A very strange flight both International and domestic passengers to Fuzhou you then vacate the plane rush through immigration and then get back on the same plane with new customers from Fuzhou going to Bangkok. The return is the same apart from at Dalian you are bused to the terminal in two separate buses one for people from Bangkok the other for new passengers from Fuzhou. Bags come out in different sections of Dalian airport. It very confusing and only one hour on ground in Fuzhou makes it a rush job. Seating average food average actually everything average.
JFK MXP JFK back and forth on an A380 with Emirates. Fantastic service starting from the ground at the check in counters in both MXP and JFK to inflight. Spacious seats good in flight entertainment and nice array of drinks offered. Only point with room for improvement are the meals reasonably good but not on par with all the rest.
ZB684 14th Dec from Manchester. ZB685 21st from SSH. Flew with Monarch this past week and got to say they were fantastic. Travelling with two under 5s isnt easy and it was our first time. On this particular flight you had to purchase meals from a trolley and provide your own inflight entertainment iPad comes in handy. Hospitality and service was excellent. Would recommend.
Never fly with them. Paid for my ticket online including a checked bagagge. When I arrive at the airport I need to wait until its my turn at the desk. I am already checked in and just need bagagge drop off. By the time I am being helped i am told that they cant take my bag as luggage anymore as it closed 5 min ago. I need to take my back pack in the plane which I am charged 70 euro for or I cannot board Outrageous They make their problem and inadequecy mine. Complete rude staff. On top while I walk outside to the planeI see indiviudual bags being carried to the luggage area of the plane. Customer support total joke. I fail a complaint with their contact form and the only response is we dont do refunds we closed your case.
Have flown previously in British Airways Business Class. Flew in World Traveler economy class on this trip with adult children on their first flight to England. Loading was chaotic. Seated middle four seat section row 49. No air conditioning in cabin. Several of us complained about heat and lack of air flow. Did not get answer from stewardess until an hour into the flight. Took 3 hours before air conditioning kicked in. No room under the seat to store handbag. Seats appear to be smaller. When person in row in front of me reclined I had minimal room to move or to access my purse. Little attention from cabin attendants. Told them I was getting dizzy from lack of cool air and they allowed me to move to seat in galley where air was cooler from Business Class seats. Food served was terrible. No advance menu to choose from. No individual lighting or air. I thought it was my worst experience until immigration 2.5 hour wait in line to clear immigration customs. Our prepaid taxi waited 90 minutes and then left. Horrible experience. The return flight was worse. Delayed 1.5 hours on the ground due to no air conditioning in Coach seating again though First and Business had it. They brought us water in the last 30 minutes. Will never fly British Airways again.
I experienced 45 mins delay with no communication given to passengers before boarding. No water was offered while passengers were waiting onboard for the airplane to get clearance to take off. Trolleys are regularly boarded as luggage due to lack of space creating additional delays. I will try to avoid it in the future.
This little airline is brilliant. Antwerp to London City. Antwerp is probably the best little airport in the world free parking 10 minute check in simple walk to the plane no fuzz. London City airport is the best airport in London so slightly above mediocre. VLM F50 clean and fitted with great new interior. Staff very friendly and despite short flight two drinks and a sandwich with a smile. Wish this service was available on more routes in Europe
Beijing to Xiamen. I used Capital Airlines flight from Beijing to Xiamen and I felt that the flight attendants were in excellent service. Although the meals is a sandwich the taste is quite good that my son ate three. I ordered coffee my wife drank tea which is very traditional Chinese. The plane arrived 30 minutes late but it arrived on time which pleased me. It is worth mentioning that in front of my pocket there is an tablet computer there are many videos and movies it is very convenient. The only problem is that carbin crew sells souvenirs during the flight but its understandable that airlines want to make more money. On the ground Hainan Airlines owns the T1 terminal in Beijing and the Capital Airlines is a subsidiary of Hainan airlines so it is also at t1. Boarding pass checked baggage boarding is very convenient the terminal is also very clean.
Phoned to change my flight and was told that it has been done. Two days later and having not received an email confirmation I phoned back and they said that the agent I spoke to did not book and I would need to pay 89 dollars as the rates have gone up pushed to fly on a different date and still there would be a 60 dollar penalty attached. Had the agent booked me in the first time I phoned I would not be incurring these costs. It took me two days of spending at least 4 hours on the phone to their international number where they are cautious not to phone you back as it will cost them and will happily put you on hold for as long as they want. First day I spoke to an agent who said that they would book me into the flight but refer me to the manager to take off incurred costs next referred to the supervisor who swore to sort this out asap waited till end of the day and phoned back and she was about to leave the office but said she has handed over to the next shift manager nothing happened. Phoned again the following morning and got hold of an agent who also promised to phone me back within an hour after three hours of waiting I phoned her back and she put me on hold to go speak to her manager and came back and said that they have reached a decision that I need to pay. Bear in mind that I have had to move this flight twice due to their incompetence. As much as I am Kenyan and would like to promote a local airline do not use these guys and It needs to be made public as they are awful and do not care at all.
Istanbul to Tehran. They lost our suitcase with all our belongings. For follow up they refered us to another interim section. Their excuse was It happens everywhere even with famous airlines. It was really waste of time and money and a bad experience for us. I will never use this airline again.
Hong Kong to Tokyo Narita and a very good low cost airline I chose Vanilla Air because of its nice flight times. Appreciated its professional and hospitable ground services. Flights took off ontime. Flight attendants were polite and attentive to all passengers. Clean seats and wellprepared inflight services offered. Very little turbulence was experienced during both flights between Hong Kong and Tokyo. Highly recommended to travellers finding late seats to go out of town. Although airfares may be about the same as those of major airlines offering inflight meals Vanillas quality and reliable services are valuable. Will choose it again in the future.
Brisbane to Toowoomba and I was amazed at the service provided by this small regional airline Skytrans Airlines. Even though the flight in a small propjet was only 30 minutes duration we were given bottles of water and packets of potato crisps. Returning the next day service was equally as good. Would recommend this airline.
I suggest you never book the flight via Go First. They rescheduled the flight 2 times on the day of departure without giving a reason of operations. All the further plans are dropped due to this delay. Worst Experience.
Do not use this airline They flew me from ProvoSalt Lake to John WayneOrange County CA and was supposed to continue onto Orlando then said that the crew did not have the hours to fly us to Orlando which now that I want reimbursement have said it was due to weather I had to get an Uber to LAX and fly to Orlando for my brothers wedding on a reputable airline. Then because it wasnt far enough away to cancel and book with a reputable airline I had to use my return ticket with them you have to cancel before 2 weeks. I guess I should be glad the didnt leave me in CA again even though we had to stop there. The flight was almost 12 hours late and to finish the worst airline experience of my life my golf clubs did not come out. The only breeze employee at the airport took my ticket stub said he would get it put in the computer because he didnt have access at 300am and suggested that if I need my golf clubs before they either find them or reimburse me I could rent some at the coarse. Like I can rent custom clubs Also try finding a person to get customer support from Breeze Its a joke I finally got a text answered but well see if jumping through their hoops is going to help.
Adria Airways has the price of a regular airline but the service of a low cost airline. All the beverages and food are for purchase. The seats are fine staff is friendly. Since we usually travel very early in the morning or very late in the evening we use the flight to rest. Every time we ask for a pillow we get one. It might sound strange but this is very important for us.
Where do I begin... arrived at airport before start of boarding. Booked first class tickets for the family in row 1 because a representative from their dialin hotline said thats where the bassinet would be. We decided to spend the additional money to ensure our 4 month old infant son and us would be comfortable. First there was no first class boarding. Waiting in line with what seemed like every other boarding class. Second arrived at our seats to discover there was no bassinet. The bassinet was the primary driver for the splurge on the 1st class seats... If I had seen the old ratty seats in the first class cabin in advance I would have never opted to spend the extra money. Oh well... nothing the flight stewardessstewards could do. They were incredibly polite. The plan takes off and everything sounds odd. After about an hour or two in air we have to turn around due to mechanical failure. We were incredibly disappointed because it was virtually impossible to get our kids into the plane. Well it happens... Seemed like onboard crew was not given any information. Meals were served and unfortunately did not have much time to eat before crew had to clear everything for landing. We ended up landing back at LAX with emergency services crews everywhere. Quite literally a fleet of fire trucks. We disembark the plane and are instructed to stay by the gate. We stay there for quite a while. At some point I notice the agents were no longer at the gate we exited the plan through but at a new gate with a new flight time and arrival time. I ask if this was our new flight and the response was less than enthusiastic. No explanation. No details. Seemed like they were looking to get back to their conversation and I was rudely interrupting. I go back to my seat and then the manager comes onto the PA system and informs everyone that the flight is delayed. I once again go to the boarding desk at the new gate and ask So what are the options now. Answer now is Youll get a room meal vouchers and then come back for a 145pm flight. I respond by telling them I would simply go home. I have 2 very young kids and its going to be incredibly difficult to I come back that early in the morning... what are my options Answer was well you can take the room and voucher or not... thats up to you. If you want a refund you would have to call. I forget the name of the department they mentioned. Once again very short and semi rude replies. Whatever were now instructed to pickup our bags at bag. I call the hotline and more of the same. Essentially go on the early morning flight or travel 2 days later. No compensation for the lost time lost money in other bookings transportation etc. not that I had asked but their general go to was file a complaint. In conclusion planes are old and tatty. Food was by far the worse Ive had on an airplane and almost all levels of customer service were incredibly bad. Ive never seen an airline with staff so uninterested in what they do. I do have to note their incabin crew was very nice. They seemed to have truly tried to help. Everyone else was godawful. Remember... if this was my experience in first class what would it be for folks in the other seats
Paris to Washington DC in November 2017. This was the worst trip of my life and I fly about 5 times a year. After checking and going thru customs the gate agent told me that I was told dark in my passport picture then later was telling his colleague in front of me that he thinks that I tampered with my Passport picture. I was so embarrassed as I was held at the gate for 30 minutes while all the passengers were looking at me like I had a fake Passport.
FRAWDH. Service is not great they are just doing their job thats it. The seats are of the old angle lie type still in good condition but nowhere near to the newest generation. The video system is a shame as not on demand and very limited choice. They started the movie before the meal was served my screen was out of order. I mentioned it but they could not or did not try anything to fix it.We chose Air Namibia only because of the direct flight. If you do not mind having connections fly with South African.
London to Islamabad via Kuwait. Well probably the worst airline ever. Check in staff allocating us 12 of us seats to every single corner of the plane my wife was lucky to have a seat with our little ones. Secondly due to delay we were rushed to our seats and hand baggage was placed everywhere. Food was excellent but our entertainment screens turned off mid air along with the assistance button system failure or something. On top of all that they lost our one piece of luggage on the way to Pakistan and as well as coming back. If this is the last plane to catch i will not catch it. Definitely avoid Kuwait as well rude behaviour of airport staff and one star airport service.
I flew on Apr 29 to Belfast changing in Heathrow and also May 6th from Belfast to via Heathrow Barcelona then May 17 from Venice Heathrow then to Vancouver BC. I was very pleased with the service and meals and flight attendants were great. The only part was that changing at Heathrow was a bit of a pain having to wait to see on the board re what gate to go to but otherwise everything was great.
Qatar Airways is one of the most professional airlines. I was very ill on flight the steward called doctor who allowed medication to be given to help me then exceptional service once arrived in Doha. I was taken to lounge to shower and escorted to a resting area as I was travelling alone. I highly recommend Qatar Airways. I felt that I was in very safe hands.
The flight from London Heathrow to Krakow with British Airways was slightly delayed but arrival on time. Standard economy class service nothing to write home about but efficient. 530pm flight to arrive at 830pm but served only a pack of chips with a drink not even a sandwich for this 2.5 hour flight. There is nothing to be purchased on BA. I believe this flight time should justify at least a sandwich that BA served on my previous experience.
Rome to Pisa. My first experience with this company was really bad. First the flight is delayed for one hour and the second I havent received my baggage and still waiting to be found.
I am extremely disappointed with the experience I am having with SpiceJet. First the flight was rescheduled 5 times between yesterday and today morning. It started at 815 am from Dubai instead of 2240 PM yesterday. Wait time at airport was extremely long for the flight to take off. To my surprise I did not receive my bag at the airport for such a short flight and no transit in between I have an important function to attend tomorrow and there is perishable stuff in the suitcase. SpiceJet service and handling has spoiled my entire trip and left me in very difficult situation. I just called their customer care number. Wait time was close to 1 hour for an agent to pick and there was no definite response when my luggage will be loaded and when I will receive. Looks like airlines support staff is clueless.
Manchester to Ercan via Istanbul. We are flying again in September and for various reasons wanted to change dates. The customer service operator was exceedingly sympathetic and helpful and while I was on the phone he exceeded my expectations and did more than I could have asked. I now have exactly what I wanted at no extra cost. We love Turkish Airlines and always use them if we can.
Zurich to Los Angeles via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Great price awesome food and cabin service smooth flight and on time. Very easy change of flights in Istanbul. Id choose Turkish Airlines again to fly .
I paid extra to get a quiet zone seat but they downgraded passengers to economy because they changed plane. No notice. I paid extra so I can get aisle but shoved in the middle. And they make make it impossible to ask for refund at the airport as they do not have physical counter at our airport. I know it is budget airline but at least give people the seat one paid for.
Travelled from Gatwick to Orlando on the 24th October with BA and I was very disappointed. For a full service airline the service was no better than a budget carrier. We were travelling with 3 children in our party of 11 and were seated at the rear of the plane. Both there and back the kids meals had run out by the time they reached us as had the edible options of adult meals. The cabin was hot which made for 2 very uncomfortable flights. We had to go and fetch our own complimentary drinks and snacks which my daughter did because she was so hungry had she not gone we wouldnt even of been aware that they were available. Lesson learned never fly BA again.
KULKCH. Firefly has cancelled all B737 routes without informing passengers. Now Im forced to buy expensive ticket which is 5x more. If they are stopping the routes Firefly should compensate more so that we can get on the next available flight without any fuss. Firefly is responsible for inconvenience caused and a refund on low fares isnt enough to cut it. They should foot the bill for expensive last minute air tickets.
Kuala Lumpur to Perth. On October 9th My husband and myself boarding on flight D7 239 at KL airport ready to come home to Perth. Our flight before was delayed so we had to rush to this flight at 11.25pm so that the plane could leave at 1205am. During this time we had no time to get anything to eat at the airport as the boarding gates were already open for us to get on to our flight so we just figured we would order food and drinks on the flight. We got on the flight and asked if we could get a movie package to which they said yes. When it came to paying for some entertainment and food and drinks the lady would not accept our debit mastercard as that was all we had for payment. So for 5 hours we were hungry and thirsty with not even water to drink. Next time we will pay extra money to fly with a better and more efficient flying company.
London to Sao Paulo. An exceptionally ordinary flight both for good and for bad. Cabin crew were disinterested I was made to feel intrusive when I asked at the galley for a glass of water between dinner and breakfast service something Id never felt before. I felt somewhat snubbed when after asking for help being short loading my exitrow hand luggage into the OHLs the FA took heed of an older woman telling him her bag had two tablets in and is fragile so should be stacked on top of mine and didnt bother to ask me about the contents of my bag my laptop speakers havent worked since. I slept through dinner service but was awake for the standard disappointment of a breakfast. A continentalcharcuterie option would go down a treat on this route I imagine but we had a choice of flaccid English breakfast or flaccid omelette. My first BA economy flight after travelling longhaul in Premium economy and Club cabins. I can see why this is the bargain fare but still better than several competitors. I felt safe we arrived early the crew were for the most part friendly. Whats more to ask for.
Bali to Bangkok. Very unprofessional airline. Did not know about check in baggage. Charged very high price for baggage. Had to pay 220 USD for check in baggage. Never fly this airline.
Doha to Paris CDG. One of the best flights I have taken the service was personal and professional the cabin staff attentive and gracious the food was good though not exceptional the tenderloin was overdone for my taste. Arabic mezze was a little bland and needed more lemon and olive oil. The entertainment system was lacking in selection though the movies were up to date but lacked in classics the TV selection was very poor. The WiFi was OK and the seat on the Qatar Airways A350 are some of the best in the business .
Brisbane to Canberra. Gate staff need to be trained in the basics of customer service not only do they harass the final few passengers but when I had my cabin bagg weighed and was over by 500 grams I was told to either leave something behind or find another airline. I was then charged 46 for being half a kilo over because I was told it would unbalance the plane. I didnt really care about the 46 dollars more just the attitude and lack of flexibility by gate staff all good though you just lost my business for good.
Jakarta to Singapore. There is a definite decline in their service. The cabin crew looked very jaded and unmotivated I can tolerate a bit of that as the flight was in the late evening. The announcement was done by a prerecorded message which in my opinion loses a bit of human touch experience. The food was okay. Nothing special in fact its pretty mediocre. They need to improve on a lot of department if they want to maintain those ratings.
Bangkok to Manchester via Dubai. In last years Emirates was my favorite carrier. But now I think their customer service quality has fallen down from top to bottom. Today I finished my trip and all 4 flights I noticed same problems bad customer service in economy class. Flight attendants not present during almost whole flight. 68 hours flight only 2 times passengers got something to drink. Yesterday BKKDXB onboard very rude flight staff. DXBMAN attendants were lazy and not very nice. Talking a lot flirting with themselves and definitely not interested about passengers. Complimentary limited WiFi never connecting. Food is poor portions are small and tasteless. Return flight to my city someone took from carousel my backpack. Guy from Emirates airport staff whom I asked about help called that passenger who swapped backpacks. Then he told me to wait for that passenger he will come soon and we can swap the backpacks again. He left me with not my backpack at public area and told me keep eye on this. I lost two hours waiting and finally airport security guys came to me and asked many questions about what I am doing here. I told them what happened. They did not believe me and checked everything around me with detector and told me this situation is definitely against airport safety rules. Big shame for Emirates. I will not use anymore Emirates because at the moment customer service is unacceptable.
ATHTLLATH nothing exciting about them but nothing to complain. The flight with an old B737300 a nice complimentary sandwich with beverage or water. We had ordered and prepaid warm meal we had to prove that we had paid to give us the meal even though the trays had our names printed on them. The younger stewardshostesses were nice and pleasant the older ones were living in the communist era of transportation. Excellent airport of Tallin new clean friendly convenient but underused. Too bad only few airlines are using it.
Worst airline ever with an inexperienced crew. Started with a 40 minute delay in which they had us wait on the gangway. They then forced us to check our bags instead of letting us put them sideways in the overhead bins which customers on our flight did claiming the flight was full and that they needed the room. At the end of boarding there were at least five empty overhead bins that could have easily accommodated our bags. We were the only ones forced to check our bags.
Verona to Amsterdam. Oneandahalfhour delay on the outbound flight and threehour delay on the return flight. On top of that the online checkin policy is ridiculous there are only a fixed number of free seats. When those are reserved either you pay 10 for a seat or you conveniently checkin at the airport desk. This experience with this company counts twice for me first and last. Ryanair feels like Emirates compared to Transavia.
Dublin to Istanbul. I was impressed by the flight. Check in and boarding went well. The staff were very friendly and helpful particularly with the younger passengers. The meal was very tasty although I was surprised they served a breakfast for a late morning departure. IFE was very good.
Travelled to Bangkok recently for work. Tired old plane with vintage entertainment system. Drinks were served before dinner no nutscrisps available followed by a passable but small dinner. As it was around 20.30 uk time I pressed the call button to ask for an after dinner drink for my colleagues and myself. After a 20 minute wait a surly disapproving stewardess arrived and gave us a dressing down essentially for still being awake and requiring service. Incorrect drinks were then brought. My colleague asked another steward who was across the cabin chatting to what appeared to be friends to correct the mistake but was told to wait. Eventually the correct drink was brought. Ive written a letter of complaint but as yet no response from British Airways. Ive flown BA a great deal and generally had a reasonable experience so its disappointing to see the general direction the airline seem to be going. The company I was working for paid for the ticket so I dont know what it cost but dont imagine it was cheap. In their defence I flew back with them from Delhi on a dreamliner a week later and the experience was fine so but the age of the plane does not excuse the staff.
Awful. Business class check in queue just as long as for economy probably because half of the desks were not staffed and Terminal 5 is chaotic. Business lounge overfull couldnt get seats. Delayed flight unmanaged chaos at the gate. No drink on boarding first drink served an hour after takeoff. The meal was poor used to get better in economy on other airlines. British Airways has won the race to the bottom of the cheapskate stakes. Not looking forward to the flight home.
Perth to Mauritius was excellent. Day flight very pleasant FA on my side the one on the other side clearly was not happy to there great food. The trip back was a little disappointing. They ran out of my choice of food fish and instead of informing me and suggesting something else on the menu they decided of give a disgusting tasteless staff meal I didnt know that and they only told me about it when I returned it untouched. In fairness they then asked if I wanted something else. Way too late guys Of course by then I was put off by the whole thing and decided to sleep instead. No flat bed is provided and for the price you charge is just not on Air Mauritius. Shame on you Flight Manager was a welcoming and very pleasant. Honesty and transparency is the best policy. Always inform the passenger first.
Sydney to Griffith. Always delayed. Overly expensive. Overall experience is beyond poor. 70 of the time I experience delays. The only reason I fly with REX is because no other airline goes to my rural destination. I understand delays are sometimes unavoidable however that should be the exception not the norm
Ho Chi Minh City to Pnom Penh. Checkin with Qatar Airways is always a blessing and takes seconds. Lounge in Ho Chi Minh City is very good Apricot 3rd part lounge since renovation recently. I was the only visitor for the entire 3 hours when I was there. Food options delicious drinks OK but the wines were useless. Good catering and predeparture drinks but the flight is so short that there is no food provided and no food is available except some sweet cookies and nuts. FAs were kind and gave me extraordinarily a free amenity kit as I inquired for but these are normally not given on short flights. Flight was early and arrived 20 Minutes ahead of schedule. I will travel economy on this route next time as the flight seems always empty. Or go by the big detour with Malaysia Airlines over Kuala Lumpur for much less if campaign prices.
This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WIFI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
My flight was supposed to be June 1st. Due to COVID19 Lima has closed their borders as well as the airport we were supposed to land in. Interjet refused to refund money or cancel the nonexistent flight so that they will be off the hook for any financial compensation. Their actions are illegal and repeated attempts to speak with their agents have been completely useless. They insisted that flights will be running as usual. Terrible business practices completely criminal the way they are hoarding money in a global pandemic.
The flight was booked for my father a Ukrainian refugee fleeing the horrific reality of what is going on in Southern Ukraine. He was denied access to the flight because Condor wrongfully told him that he has to be vaccinated have a negative covid 19 test to enter the country. According to AMENDED NATIONAL INTEREST EXCEPTION FROM PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATION 10294 ADVANCING THE SAFE RESUMPTION OF GLOBAL TRAVEL DURING THE COVID19 PANDEMIC and I quote President of US determined it is in the national interest to permit temporarily the entry of noncitizen nonimmigrants who 1 are traveling with a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident 2 were physically present in Ukraine as of February 10 2022 and 3 possess valid travel documents allowing them to travel to the United States. He had a valid Ukraine passport with a visa that covers him under this mandate. They dismissed him in the most disrespectful manner and misguided him into staying in the airport without means to flying and German language deficiency to escalate the issue to proper channels to get on the flight. It is unacceptable handling of the matter by Condor as a company and its employees. We had to rebook a flight on United at triple the cost and he was able to fly with no issues or any Covid19 constraints.
LYSORN. Clean and new aircraft FAs could be a little more professional. Nice complete meal. I am used to taking this airline to go to Algeria and it is really improving.
London Heathrow to Budapest. It seems British Airways has lost so much of its traditional customer base that its turning into a budget airline at scheduled prices. I only fly with them now when tour operators give me no choice. Ground staff were the now usual bunch of jobs worths refusing to change my seat because thats what the computer has allocated. Boarding was the now expected shambles. The no checked baggage fare option results in so many oversized bags being carried on board that overhead space for small cases is at a premium. On this flight several were removed from lockers and the owners rudely told to put them under the seat in front thus severely restricting leg room. Cabin staff were rude and uncaring. Again now the norm for BA. The in flight snack was a soggy croissant and a small plastic cup of tepid stewed tea. The seats are very narrow allowing minimal room a no space between neighbouring passengers.
Flight No. OK723 Departure 8.25pm Late departure Aircraft Turboprob not the youngest but ok. The flight attendants were not very friendly like they would be happy to have end of work after this flight. I pressed the service button wanted to ask if there is regular cabin service and nothing happened. They switched on the full light when preparing FB service but forgot to switch off afterwards. When collecting the waste they ignored me several times. All in all okay scarce.
Early morning flight London Heathrow to Glasgow with British Airways. Checkin very easy via App. Heathrow T5 was fairly busy but I was quickly through security. Full flight departed gate A19 on time. Cabin very smart with new seating. Service was very good with a hot breakfast which was very tasty.
I hadnt flown with BA for quite a number of years so after seeing their new fleet I was expecting something modern. Instead it was like being in a time warp. The aircraft had seen better days in my opinion and judging by the IFE equipment and the inner design damaged lights and uncomfortable seats it showed. Our nearest toilet was out of action not good. The crew were okay the service was okay it was just a convenient way of A to B in my opinion nothing else. Only until this airline manage to update everything they offer utilise aircraft wise and provide as much emphasis on their everyday economy folk as they do on their frequent fliers I may consider them again. Value for money is negligible and after using other forward thinking modern airlines the experience made the end of a great holiday feel somewhat sour.
Nashville to Minneapolis. As I was checking in I noticed the rep processing it was new and had questions she referred to another rep that was more experienced. The new rep took my bags and had not labeled them yet. So I made the statement that I would like to see my bags label for check in before I walk away just make sure nothing gets missed. The experienced worker with an attitude said that we are professionals it will be handled. She said it in the most unprofessional condescending way and then walked away. I hope that customer service training will be followed up with this experienced rep. She was certainly teaching the new lady to be a smart mouth just like her. Sounds like a bad culture problem within Sun Country the at has gone unchecked
San Francisco to London. Efficient check in by friendly agent who offered an upgrade to First at 760 per person which we declined. Refurbished lounge was spacious and comfortable with nice selection of snacks. Boarding on time but could have been better controlled. Flight left and landed ahead of schedule. Flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip. Business Class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints.
Cathay is a great airline if you get on the plane. They are absolutely horrendous when it comes to cancelling flights and being inflexible and unable to accommodate you on partner airlines. My flight in November 2022 was cancelled and the would not let me fly on a oneworld partner. Instead they wanted me to do a 3 day layover and arrive 3.5 days late to my destination. Which is not ideal when you booked a 3 day trip. Only when I pointed out to them that I was arriving after my return flight left did they say oh maybe we need to rebook the return too then. Ridiculous. There are tons of oneworld partner flights that would get me there on time but they refused to accommodate me on any of them.
British Airways from Gatwick to Catania Sicily return as part of package tour of Sicily. Outward journey was very cramped staff were unhelpful and the light afternoon snack was served in a cardboard box. One round of drinks very hurriedly served. Return flight was very similar but the staff were even worse snack literally thrown at us and passengers told not to move until rubbish collected. No inflight entertainment provided.
Checkin staff were talkative and helpful. They fully recognized my Qantas Gold membership. The seat was spacious and comfortable. It could easily be controlled. Storage was fine but can be improved. The meals on board were very good and delicious. Flight attendants were a bit robotic although they were kind polite and helpful. They did not appear much in midnight though. The Arrival Lounge in HKG was fabulous with a la carte service style. The only thing to complain about are that the price was too pricey and the flight was too short.
We encountered the worst customer service with LAN Airlines that I have ever seen. We arrived over an hour before our departure time check in went as usual they took our bags and then someone whispered something in the checkin attendants ear and we were suddenly told we were not allowed on the plane because we were late. We requested to see the supervisor and right in front of us the supervisor left the building and went home for the evening. After being passed around from employee to employee it became clear they sold our seat and did not have space for us anymore. They refused to offer us a solution stating were just not going to get to go. They stated all other flights to our destination were sold out for the rest of the week and they would not put us on another flight. The treatment and the way they spoke to us was unbelievable and unacceptable. We have traveled all around the world utilizing a variety of airlines and never experienced anything like this. There was one woman there we encountered who was helpful efficient and kind. Other than that it was a very disrespectful and abusive experience. We will never fly this airline again.
Singapore to Honolulu via Seoul Incheon. Singapore to Incheon on an A330300 which has the new economy class seats. I was impressed by the legroom which makes this 6 hours flight more than comfortable. The touch screen IFE system is very responsive I am a pop songs enthusiast the IFE had offered me so far the greatest variety of songs. My connecting flight from Incheon to Honolulu is operated by an old B747400 and even though the IFE is the old version the seat was surprisingly comfortable despite the outdate it still has wide choices of songs and movies. For both flights the meals were very tasty the cabin crew and ground staff in Incheon airport are very friendly and helpful. I would definitely fly again soon.
Nickle and dime policy is lame. Charge for water coffee to pick a a seat. A carry on bag is a terrible policy. Had I known I would not have chosen Play to fly. The checked bag prices is excessive. All in all I spent 250 per person more than the posted price. No in flight tv no charge ports .. smallest legroom of any airline Ive flown. Uncomfortable seats. All of this is short sighted business. I will not choose Play again.
Vietnam Airlines co shared with Pacific Airlines. The original flight as by booking was rescheduled from 16.30 to 17.50. The flight was delayed from 17.50 to 20.45. The arrival was 3 hrs and 59 min too late referring the original time and 2 hrs and 59 min late referring the rescheduled time. During the delay there was no information given at the airport nor did we received drink or food. The airline refers to the rules. For this airline the rules are more important then the customer. Dissatisfying for me.
Moscow to Melbourne via Chongqing. The flight with this airline couldnt be any worse. There were not a single movie in English or Russian not even with subtitles at the Chongqing airport passengers flying to Melbourne were not allowed to leave the airport for 20 hours not even with Australian passports. We lost money paying for a hotel in the city and had to seat in a small terminal with only a couple of shops and cafes for so long. The airline didnt bother to offer a food voucher. The staff of the business lounge at the terminal tried to rip us off charging 50 just to take a shower food was awful as well. My tickets was very expensive due to the soccer word cup in Moscow.
Krabi to Bangkok. Customer service is terrible. Meal impossible to eat cabin crew okay. Extra legroom not worth the extra cost of US11 minimal difference with a regular seat.
San Francisco to Paris. Very pleasant flight the food was great restrooms clean very comfortable. The crew was polite and they wanted to serve us any time we asked. Flight was on time
Horrible. Delayed plane. Once landed extra long wait to deplane. Baggage delay of over 1 hour or more. Horrible. They leave you no reason to smile. Do not fly with them.
Disaster 2 tries 1 canceled flight and 1 postponed 9 hours. Even Vietjet has more options. They destroyed our holidays twice in 2 months time. Its isnt worth the hassle and its more costly in the end. Do not try it you will regret it.
Dublin to Dubai. Emirates is my favourite airline. Upon boarding the aircraft I was greeted with smiles and welcomed. On the seat is a blanket and headphones. There is plenty of legroom inflight entertainment system is wonderful. A large range of TV shows movies and documentaries suited for all tastes. The inflight dining is the best I have experienced with any airline. The process of connecting in Dubai was seamless with staff on hand to assist passengers.
Flight was professionally operated it was an economy class European flight nothing special but plane was new well presented and staff friendly. Pay only refreshments which is more and more frequent but still disappointing. All in all decent flight recommend Air Europa for short hops.
Horrible airline with zero live customer service. You are better off paying a couple dollars more with any other airline. I purchased two tickets for my cousin and husband as their wedding gift they overbooked the flight and said that it was a bank issued. I called the bank and they said that there was no issue on their end and that the transaction had been approved. Volaris WhatsApp customer service refused to admit that they had done wrong on their part and simply said that it was the bank which was false. Will never fly with them again.
Im a Lufthansa frequent flyer on the Sao PauloFrankfurt route but this time I decided to give TAM a try. Equipment was a Boeing 773. Seat factor something between 95 and 100 mainly Brazilians onboard. Was pretty much impressed with the large quantity of movies and films available on the IFE. Cabin crew friendly did speak good English but I do agree with some previous reviews too much talking and gossiping among them. Food quality was in my opinion better than Lufthansa but what a small portion I got for dinner Good breakfast but no tea available. I found the seat more comfortable than LH did especially appreciate the footrest each seat has. A small amenity kit was also a nice touch. At the end I have to say I was satisfied but Lufthansa will still be my first choice.
Heathrow Johannesburg. Concorde lounge comfortable as always. A little underwhelmed at first by first class on the A380 not as spacious or appealing as I had expected. However it had all that I needed including a very good screen for the IFE. Had the 5course taster menu but different wines than those which were suggested. Was very good indeed did not have the dessert but the better half pronounced it outstanding. Unfortunately arrived at same time as several other longhaul flights so immigration was a pain but not much BA can do about that.
This is not the first time being a passenger of Citilink. There isnt much that I can consider to be an advantage of this airline because this airline is a lowcost airline. But one thing that impressed me with this airline was that until now I have never experienced a late departure. Their cabin crew is also one of the best behaved in Indonesia. I ordered heavy food during the flight the fried rice they sell in my opinion has above average taste. Fly with Citilink if you dont believe what I said above.
Extremely convenient flight times. Departure was also on time. I liked the practice of serving complimentary glasses of water during a national heatwave despite most of of their American counterparts charging for a cup of water Seats were also nice and comfortable. Would definitely recommend.
London Sanaa to Jakarta and found the service bad. I chose for Yemenia because it was the cheapest rate. I never have been in a airline with such rude FAs especially the male attendants IFE was below average seat was cramed not comfortable inflight catering was OK but the cabin interior was so dirty. I feel sorry for the pax who sit near the restrooms it smells so bad
Bangkok to New York JFK via Taipei. This is the first time I have flown EVA Air and it was 5 star in all respects. I flew Business Class with a short 55 minute stopover in Taipei easy transit between planes both planes B777300ER. I have flown over one million miles on Star Alliance usually business class and EVA has to rate at the top of the list. Everything from their website airport checkin lounge seat comfort inflight entertainment system and incredibly great service by the flight attendants was 5 Star. The individual flat bed business class pods were spacious comfortable and very functional with the cabin staff preparing your bed for sleep with a mattress cover comfortable pillow and nice duvet. I preordered one of my inflight meals from the online menu which was very extensive. The rack of lamb was perfectly prepared and restaurant quality. I was able to get an uninterrupted 8 hours of sleep on my 14 hour flight and wokeup well rested upon my arrival in New York. I highly recommend EVA.
Flew CPHDOHSGN 22236 on newer B787800s. Award ticket. All flights on time all luggage handled perfectly labelled priority and arrived quickly. Cant fault the trip anything and have to score it 1010. Checkin in CPH quick and pleasant done within Minutes which gave me almost 4 hours in lounges as the many counters opens 4 hours prior to departure. I was given plenty of seat options as flights were fullabout to be full. The Eventyr Lounge that they use is nice and improving the view is gorgeous. Smooth boardings and deboardings all on jetbridges. I oppose the by far too early gate calls 80 Minutes before departure in CPH despite gate is only 3 Minutes away from lounge. Lounge in DOH has changed to the new Silver Lounge at Bgates. Its roomy and nice though 12 steps below the level of the Al Mourjan lounge on the other hand it provides tarmac views as the only of its kind in Doha. Onboard a breeze of service FA attention and recognition of status level. 3 hot meals offered from CPH I tried 2 of them they were quite good. Drinks rounds and offerings were plenty incl sparkling wine on both flights. Last flight there were 2 hot breakfast option I craved for a 3rd option and they managed to deliver it to perfection after only 20 Minutes additional waiting. Impressive on a full flight. Managed to sleep 3 hours on the last flight in an exit row seat with meters ahead of me for leg stretching. IFE was top notch with 150 movies the best I have had on any economy flight. Headsets provided however I used my own. Full ratings and recommended despite the airline is very conservative but also predictable and reliable
I feel more like telling others of positive experience. And my Lufthansas flight from Madrid to MunchenMunich 26. April was a very good experience. A brand new very clean aircraft a wonderful welcoming crew and above all a very good hot meal I chose chicken breast. Im impressed this was only a two hours flight. Good wines.
I made the round trip Asturias to Malaga. I am a member of Volotea and I have a series of discounts. It is very easy to travel with this company established in Asturias both when searching for flights and when checkingin. The ground crew is very friendly and the cabin crew. We went in emergency exit seats and the space is very wide. I have no complaints.
Singapore to Sydney. I think Singapore Airlines is overall a very good airline but I think their premium economy compared to Qantas is ordinary. No curtain separating cabins no welcome drink meals out of aluminium containers. The only difference to economy is better seats. Not worth the extra money and not special.
Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt via Dubai booked for April 2020. Worst customer service contact Center ever. Please improve the only option given to change flight is to contact local office in this case why shorten the working hours of a contact Center The agent is totally incompetent This will be the last time. Perhaps they dont care.
The ground service is awesome. A kind lady took me to choose my seat helped me address my oversized luggage and led me to the security check. the airline service is good too almost everyone could get a blanket if they wanted. The next flight from Sydney to Perth I even couldnt get a blanket in the plane from Qantas.
Delayed just for a change. Poor communication. British Airways sells premium prices flight tickets and delivers no better than a low cost airline. Customer service is impossible to contact and it seems BA tries hard to hide any possible email communication address when its available.
I bought seats for all my family 4 persons I got requested by Turkish airline to confirm to agree to schedule change its just 10 mins delay of Istanbul to singapore. I click agree then all my bought seats went scrambled lost my bought seats. I did feedback forum complaint and uploaded screenshot of my previous email of my bought seats and call the customer service with same answer from Turkish airline. So I had to buy another seat arrangement because they separated our family seats for Istanbul to singapore. Practically forcing me to buy another seats arrangements if i want to seat with my family. I paid 2 times for the same flight for the seats and i had to spent 67 times call to their Turkish airline customer service with no solution. They always have the same answer system shows I only bought 2 seats instead of 4 seats despite the email evidence that prove otherwise. This is the first time for me that a bought paid seats can be cancelled and lost. Plus when we landed in Istanbul the flight gate wont show up until 90 mins before flight time and 30 mins before boarding time. As we landed in gate A we had to hurry up to gate F once the gate showed in the billboard. Practically from one end to the other end. My advise avoid this airline if possible.
Check in agent at Glasgow was very cheerful and polite. Both crews were efficient and polite if not particularly engaging. In economy it was a very standard service. I like the new seats on both aircraft. What I dont like is having to transfer from T5 to T3 at Heathrow. Over the past several years I seem to always end up travelling to the destinations requiring this transfer which adds a lot of time and hassle to what would be an extremely efficient domestic to international connection at T5.
Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The checkin and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100 confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system 1 to 5 which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again Im not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous days strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room Im 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front. The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin believe 2 in Club cabin who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BAs fault.
Disappointing and very expensive flight with Batik this time. Not sure what is happening on the Perth to Bali route but extra competition has recently come in with CitiLink starting the route with Airbus A320. Very surprised when my flight cost me close to 600AU for this time of year. Flight from Perth to Bali was fine usual standard of service that Im generally quite happy with. Return flight however was total opposite. People were very late people were juggled about in their seats. Basically crew were triple checking everything. As an ex pilot I think that something was amiss with the weight and balance of the aircraft on that flight. Flight took off over 30 minutes late lots of ground staff checking things. Strangest thing a fairly healthy and young man was moved out of the exit row because he was having some pain with a tattoo that had been recently done. Cabin crew moved a young woman into that seat who quite honestly would never have been able to remove that window if an emergency had occurred. Same on the other side the men took zero notice of the briefing but still the cabin crew just let it happen. Lastly just a bit of a heads up for travellers take into consideration what you expect to take as carry on. Im all for the airlines charging a lot extra for this service. People take it too far. On my flight Im surprised the overhead above me did not drop open. Have some consideration people As for Batik cabin crew you need to be more conscientious about how you move your passengers around.
Old aircraft seats very narrow and uncomfortable however so called Premium Class did not look much different. The food was average strange tasting served in unsuitable packaging. However the cabin staff was extremely positive friendly and helpful.
Melbourne to Rome via Doha. I would like to praise the excellent customer service I received from an agent at the desk at Melbourne Airport. He went out of his way to assist me and after a long stressful day and his professionalism courtesy and passion for his position was reflected in his treatment of me.
Birmingham Bangkok via stopover in Tehran. Fairly basic service but courteous and attentive staff checkin good both ways. No PTV entertainment in economy just one large screen showing various poor quality Iranian films and documentaries. Food questionable quality but plenty of nonalcoholic drinks. Most passengers appeared to be travelling either to Iran or onwards to India and similar think we were the only Europeans going to Bangkok. Stopover in Tehran was fine staff helpful business lounge not bad at all. Women must wear headscarves though and cover bare armsshoulders. Mahan provided garments gratis for this purpose.
Helsinki to London via Helsinki. The flexibility readiness and kindness of the cabin crew reminded me why I have appreciated BA in the past and continue to do so they do what they say they will do and do it well. BA makes me happy to pay the little extra for a bag and a small meal when I get treated like a person and given an exit row seat as a tall person when there was one and I am 66.
Failed at all basic travel fundamentals 1 Our flight was delayed. 2 Staff demanded that we check in our carry on luggage even though we met our carry on allowance. The fact that we have a tight bus connection was totally ignored. 3 Staff were quite unpleasant.
Twice they messed up my flight. First time when I was flying to Lviv they messed up the dates and I couldnt do check in because I was not in the system. The people whos working there not professional I spoke with over 20 different people over the phone to check whats going with my flight they couldnt fix anything and it was their fault. So when I was going to the airport I still didnt know if Im flying or not. I got to the airport on rush 1 hour before registration because I was on the line and they didnt tell me anything and didnt fix it. And it was international flight when you supposed to get there at least 3 hours before. But I didnt know that was just a beginning when I supposed to return back from Lviv that was happened again. Messed up my dates my flight I was holding on the line the whole night and they send me final confirmation 1 hour before registration in the morning.
Sydney to Doha. Upgraded online in advance for an emergency exit window seat. With it being a very long flight and having done these flights in the past with regular seat I wanted to make sure this flight could be more comfortable. I get to my seat number at boarding to find that its a regular window seat with no space at all. When I asked crew members why my booked seat isnt available they said its because the aircraft was changed from what was on my booking. On top of this crew members were rude unattentative and blocked people in the toilets by leaving trolleys in front of the door. They seemed under qualified no confidence often missed people out when serving drinksfood. Lots of people angry with the service.
Perth to Singapore. Dirty tray table bad cabin crew poor special meal. During the day flight the window shades on empty seats were up and cabin crew were not bothered to pull them down and a couple of passengers went to do it themselves in front of the cabin crew who just started blankly and didnt do anything about the remaining blinds that were up. On the way to Perth from Singapore I was given the dessert despite being on the special meal but on the return flight the steward proceeded to pass it to me but then retracted his arm back when he saw I was on the special meal and no explanation was given. It was not any vegetarian meal as well but why is there no consistency Worst thing was there was no explanation and he just walked away.
I had the worst experience on the flight from LHR to GOI I purchased a premium seat which was meant to have extra legroom which was 30A on the 787 seat map it showed that there was plenty of space. But to my surprise this seat did not have a window and it was before the partition which did not leave much space.
What an unpleasant experience. I traveled with Luxair on the 14th of July and till today 30th of October I have never received my luggage or received any compensation. I think I have been so patient and you guys dont seem to care. This is very careless. It was my first time traveling with this airline and the last time. U
Flew KigaliMombasa with RwandaAir 3rd Dec 2013. Booked online which was hassle free. No online checkin though. The plane was modern 737800 American cockpit crew local cabin staff. Leather seats with good legroom. Despite short flight 1.5hrs they managed to serve hot meal. Professional and friendly cabin crew. Overhead screens displaying flight tracking only. The plane was half empty which partly explains the efficient service. 45mins delay on departure 30mins on arrival. Bags were waiting on belt when clearing immigration. Surprisingly good experience flying with RwandaAir.
This is my fourth time flying Qatar in business class I have flown Qatar in the economy a few times in the past. While the experience of the flying economy was always great flying business class takes it to a totally new level. I have flown business class with Emirates and American before but none of them come even close to what Qatar offers. To start off Qatar is the only airline that offers ondemand dining it feels like I am in a 5star restaurant the food quality and the inflight service are always superb the staff both ground and inflight are well trained and very professional. I am positive the business class experience in Qatar is better than most airlines firstclass service. On my last flight I chose a lobster dish for my dinner I can honestly say it was better than any other lobster dish I have tried in many fancy restaurants. Last but not the least the lounge at Doha airport is one of the best I have ever experienced from the shower facility to the quality of the food simply amazing. Please keep it up and I will always pick Qatar over any other airline.
On my flight to Cebu I was covered in bug bites by the end of my flight. On my return flight we were the first ones to check in and the the attendant put my husbands name in twice and erased mine. So we had to wait for 2 12 with a child stuck in the check in area. Then they finally fixed it without help we were separated on the flight home and they wouldnt upgrade one of us.
Boarded flight from PBI to HVN on 123122. During boarding there was an issue as two teens werent allowed to board due to the plane being overweight. Pilot said that we had to carry extra fuel due to weather in New Haven. After 45 minutes of a standoff the girls boarded the plane. No clue what changed to allow that. The first attempt to take off was aborted due to a light going off. We pulled off the runway and waited until that cleared. So an hour after our scheduled departure we took off. We didnt land at our estimated time and it was clear we were circling. When we finally landed 20 minutes after the pilot said we would he then announced that we were in Hartford. Once in Hartford we were stuck on the tarmac for 90 minutes until a gate opened up. When it did we were allowed to deplane with zero communication from flight crew about next steps. In fact it was only a BDL employee at the gate that mentioned that our bags werent being unloaded. Hopefully they will show up in New Haven today but weve heard nothing from Avelo and its impossible to get through to them. I understand that weather happens. Ive been delayed and diverted before but the lack of communication and safety concerns were horrific.
After standing in line to check a bag for 1 and a half hours Francisco asked to weigh my carry on it was 8kgs then he said I need to weigh my small pack pack with it total was 12kgs. he said the limit is 10kgs and I have to pay 500 pesos 25.00 for the 2 extra Kgs. I fly once a month to Cabo but I will never fly Volaris again worse than Spirit
Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Narita. This was our family first flight with ANA. The reason we chose ANA was due to its connectivity and relatively cheap airfare as we were flying multicities in Japan. The seat width was reasonable and legroom was good. Cabin service is one of the best. The window tinting feature of Boeing 787 is very unique and hightech. One setback was the fabric seat getting hot after flown for hours. It would be better if the aircraft were fitted with leather seats. Announcements were generally made in Japanese with only important short messages announced in English.
What a terrible experience We booked our son on a flight from Altoona PA to El Paso TX. The first leg of his travel was with Boutique Airlines BA to Puttsburgh PA. BA said they couldnt fit my sons guitar on the plane and told him it would be shipped on a plane the next day by United Airlines UA which meant we would have to drive an hour and a half back to El Paso the next day to pick it up. The customer service rep offered no alternative solution other than to contact UA the next day to see if they would ship it. Then we had a text from our son saying that he missed his connecting flight in Pittsburgh because the flight departed late from Altoona and the UA connecting flight in Pittsburg left early The UA rep told our son they left early because BA did not enter his name into the system so UA thought all passengers were onboard There were no more flights to El Paso that day so UA kindly put him up in a hotel and gave him a food voucher. Since the flight to El Paso the next day would have our son arriving too late to attend a planned event we are now driving 3 hours to pick him up in Albuquerque UA said they will arrange to have his luggage delivered to our door from from El Paso So kudos to UA and two thumbs down to Boutique Air
Sydney to Beijing via Changsha. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality. I flew Sydney to Beijing. The ground staff and flight attendants were very helpful and accomodating. The person at the checkin counter offered to sit me towards the front of the plane instead of the back so I can get off quicker as I had a connection. Flight Attendants spoke good English and their uniforms were quite lovely. They gave a blanket pillow and a kit featuring a toothbrush eye shade toothpaste socks and ear plugs. The movie selection was great and included recent Oscar nominated films such as The Shape of Water. The flight crew was quick to respond to my requests of water as well. Would definitely recommend this airline One of the best I have flown with.
Kathmandu to Varanasi via Delhi. Schedule changes all the times they have a policy that allow them to anticipate or postpone a flight in 2 hours and they can even decide it less than 12 hours before the original ETD. Every single flight has been changed at least twice and one has been cancelled. Ive lost a train connection because of them. They have a baggage scam their website informs that tickets bought abroad allows 25kg of baggage.They do not honour the baggage allowance and provide only a ridiculous 15kg of course you can buy 5kg more It will cost only USD 30flight. Ive flown with Jet Airways Air India Indigo and Vistara no problems with the last 3. So if you want a smooth experience dont go with Jet Airways.
One of the reasons I fly first class is the first class lounge. I pay on average triple the price. I went to the lounge today and was turned back with the excuse that they changed the rules to accommodate their members that is unless I pay an additional 30. Apparently the 30 allows them to bend the new rules. Its not about the members its about the money. Just another way they are taking care of their customers. I fly about 810 trips per year all of them with Alaska Airlines. Im pretty stubborn so I mean it when I say that this is my last flight with them.
The airline decides to change our original departurereturn times and we call trying to adjust our flights accordingly a normal procedure for most flights. Copa Air is the biggest scam Ive witnessed they basically switched one of our flights to profit off of us by giving us an undesirable flight at 2 am and when we called to correct it they tried to charge us an exorbitant fee of 3000 to return our original departure time of 3pm. This has to be the worst airline Ive ever witnessed. Instead I am forced to pay 300 and rebook with american airlines instead. Disgrace of an airline.
Check in at AUH fast Al Dhabi contract Lounge average in terms of offerings and service. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha uneventful with good service and decent snack. Oryx One Play entertainment system again not working throughout the flight. No contact gate in Doha with a long 20 min bus ride from a remote stand. Qatar Platinum Lounge South crowded but fast service and good offerings. 2nd leg to BKK aircraft change from A380 to B773 without being informed. Random seat assigned. Luckily realized this some time before and changed to a decent seat. Boarding organized and from a contact gate. Flight service good with average catering. WIFI not working.
Bengaluru to Delhi. Low cost carrier that provides low leg space below average food menu average service and zero tolerance to excess baggage. Avoid if you can pay a little more for better comfort. Clean aircraft and helpful crew.
Manila to New York via Tokyo. I am very happy with the service and cleanliness of this aircraft ANA and the FAs are very helpful and accommodating. They are also helpful during the flight not only with my baby but other babies too. They are mindful to our needs as a family and always courteous and polite.
Prague to Beijing. We made a seat reservation online and as we checked in we got other seats. As we entered the plane the very kind cabin staff asked me if I want to sit on a seat next to the emergency exit with enough space for my legs so this flight was a very pleasant trip for me. The staff were so friendly and very thankful to get a smile and thank you back for their work on the flight. The entertainment system got a good selection of different media like movies or music but music was hanging sometimes on my system with movies it was much more critical and my colleagues told me the same that movies were running out of buffer were hanging. I hope that more people will give the service crew a little bit of thanks for their good job they do on a flight to make us passengers happy.
Bonaire to Aruba via Curacao with Insel Air. Worst airline ever. Had 2 flights and both of them were delayed several hours. We spent 7 hours waiting today without further notice. Airplanes are old and dirty. Service is beneath acceptable. Choose another airline if you can this will ruin all of your plans.
Excellent service. I flew on a 1hr 5m flight and the crew were excellent from boarding to disembarking. The crew offered a complimentary snack onboard the seats are comfortable and the flight was smooth. There were no delays or inconveniences during the flight. The seats recline and although they are a bit old they are still leather and big so its very comfortable. The crew helped me find my seat and they had a great attitude when I ordered a glass of water twice. I will fly with them again 100 recommended.
I often fly DiliDenpasar. In comparison to Merpati the big thing is that they have newer more comfortable aircrafts. Otherwise they seem the same as Merpati frequent delays allow a lot of time if youre connecting through Bali poor ground staff and coordination ok inflight service and meals.
Jakarta to Bali. In the past I was amazed by the development of Garuda Indonesia but what I saw and felt the quality of Garuda Indonesia airlines experienced a sharp decline. I can feel it when I receive a different quality of service from the previous 2 years such as providing food ticket prices and airport services. For me at this time Garuda Indonesia is not worthy of getting a 5star airline award
Mexico City to Houston. Do not check in your bags. I paid to check in 2 bags and things were stolen. I did not realize it until I got home. I called numerous numerous times and nobody would let me do a report because I had left the airport. They do not care about the customers.
Paris to Rome. The staff on board were nice but thats the only good thing. They lost my baggage then continued to provide us with a lot of false information about when it would arrive. Finally got it back but I am never flying with Air France again.
Booked the trip as far possible out as I could so I think it was value for money compared with other airlines. The A350 being a new aircraft is great to fly in. Best features about the flights Lie flat bed great for me being 6 feet plus no need to ask a crew member to make the bed up. Managed to sleep quite easily. Crews on all legs polite courteous and workmen like no unnecessary chit chat addressed by my name and cabin staff introduced themselves. The privacy of the cabin is excellent. Food I would say average plus tried the Beefburger and Chips It didnt work for me. Minor grumble no additional breads offered any more at the main meal or breakfast and I had to ask for coffee otherwise I would never get one. Great showers in the Wing at Hong Kong airport. When it runs well Cathy is a very good airline.
Flight was delayed they tried to move our seats even though we paid to sit together. Told the woman at the D6 gate at 11AM and she tells me to calm down and saying whatever under her breath. Nastiest woman in the airport. The flight attendants on board are the same way. They treat their customers like garbage and delay flights. Never again will I fly with this company. Worst experience and unprofessional staff . Terrible and so disappointed. There was no reason to treat people who pay money to fly with you like that.
I was traveling for work to and from Amsterdam to Samos. I was seated on the first row with even for the B7378 a lot of space for my legs. Slept almost the whole time so for me this was a perfect flight. Cabin crew were very professional
Shanghai Pudong to Taipei Taoyuan. When I found out that the aircraft I was flying on had a 343 economy class configuration I was worried. However after boarding I realised that my seat 72H was the second last row and thus the seats were in a 242 configuration. Thus the aisle space was very wide and the seat was very comfortable. Despite the seat being near to the toilet this was not much of a problem. Furthermore legroom was plenty and the seat was wide. The Inflight Entertainment was large and responsive but offered a limited variety of movies. There was only one seatback pouch and it would have been nice to have additional storage areas like additional pouches for smaller things. Food was served on this 1h 30min flight and it was surprisingly delicious for such a short flight. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful. However upon arrival in Taipei we waited on the tarmac for 30 mins before finding a gate space for us to park at. Other than that the overall flight experience was good.
Jakarta to Sorong. Avoid this airline if you dont live in Jakarta Flight was cancelled a month before scheduled departure. When I called for a refund for my Sriwijaya Air website credit card purchase I was told that I had to go to the Jakarta main office to process a refund. As I live in the US this is obviously a problem. No explanation why they cant just refund my credit card like a normal company. So I will spend my one day in Jakarta going to their head officeneedless to say I am not optimistic I will get my US700 back. Lesson learnednever fly Sriwijaya Air
Picture this your flight is delayed for a reroute flight plan but eventually takes off 30 mins later only to land 3 hours later at an unscheduled airport causing you and your wheelchair assist family to miss an international connecting flight and now you are stranded. You cannot rebook your flight using the app as it still says delayed 3 hours later. You are directed to call an speak to an agent which is a 3.5 hour long wait while your connecting flight has already landed You are not offered even a beverage. You cannot receive your luggage in order drive to the next airport. And your family cannot receive any updates from the staff who are now mutes. But you have paid upfront all of the required fees and taxes for every single facet of these flights. And somehow the courtesy of communication was not included in that cost. Take your business elsewhere. It would be easier to just walk.
I am a Macau SAR passenger who had purchased Scoot ticket flying from Taipei to Sapporo. Due to Coronavirus situation in our Country we were banned to travel to Taiwan by Taiwan Government. We were unable to take Scoot flight to CTS. We requested refund defer our tickets due to this uncontrollable situation but after several emails we were being informed Scoot will not provide any assistance to this situation. Other Airlines Air Macau MFMTPE Jetstar CTSNRT had accepted our refund request and would process shortly.
My initial flight was cancelled 8 hours prior the flight. Then I was automatically rescheduled for next day. Next day the flight was delayed leaving Hamburg and missed my connecting flight to Las Vegas. Me and several other passengers spent the night in London. British Airways provided us with vouchers but the transfer bus dropped us at the wrong hotel closest to our hotel and told us that we can walk there if we want to. As a result I lost two nights hotel reservations that I made in las Vegas. I opened a claim and provided all receipts to British Airways to get refund of my hotel reservations but over 5 weeks now not a single feedback from British Airways. I will avoid all flights with them in future and will share this story.
Faro to Gatwick. Club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at Faro. BA now do have use of a 3rd party lounge here which sadly is absolutely awful It feels like an average office canteen with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there. Its really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc. Considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport its a pathetic offering. Food was minimal and basic drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates available. Whilst BA do provide priority boarding they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this. Once on board I have similar comments to my outbound flight.. in my opinion they should provide a better welcome a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off. Overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier.. at one point I dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone elses seat. I was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all instead just looking mildly annoyed that I was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it. Priority disembarkation and baggage at Gatwick worked well and it meant we missed all queues at immigration and we landslide really quickly.
Flair Airlines is dishonest. Reasons are generated by Flair Airlines for delays and cancellations. I received an initial reason aircraft has been delayed in Ottawa YOW due to adverse weather conditions affecting flight schedule outside airlines control. My flight was delayed 7 hours and the weather was just fine in both locations I contacted the Flair compensation department following the delay. From my experience Flair Airlines fails to respond to emails in a timely manner Flair Airlines denies compensation and generates alternative reasons for delays after delays have occurred. Terrible customer service.
The worst company with bag policy. Even if the luggage was in the dimensions given in the website I got a fine of 48 euros. Do not consider consider to choose this company over a bit more expensive companies.
Riyadh to Istanbul. They rescheduled my flight with the short notice and I had to stay at the airport for four hours waiting for my flight and I had to pay extra money. On top of that I arrived four hours later then my expected arrival where I had to take a taxi instead of my brother picking me up. In the airplane I wanted to charge my phone but there was no outlet nor USB port.
Bali to Tokyo via Singapore. First leg Bali to Singapore on A330. Ordered special fruit platter meal and tasted delicious. Great choice of inflight entertainment. Toilet hygiene could have been improved. Second leg Singapore to Tokyo Haneda a comfortable flight on latest Boeing 777300ER cabin. Both midnight snack and breakfast were tasty. New wide 11.1inch IFE screen offered latest movies TV programs and nice flight path simulation. Needed to wait for quite a while for baggage but that is airports fault not SIAs.
Hong Kong to London via Paris. Flight was cancelled one hour prior the boarding. The ground staff from Air France came after 1.5 hour not very clear in the explanation to all the passengers. Pretty impolite I would say leaving people wondering and upset. Our flight was rescheduled for the day after but we have to use another airline for the connecting flight means take all luggage again which is inconvenient travelling with a baby. The alternative provided by the service is being redirected and downgraded to economy with another airline. I am Platinum member I would have expected to be upgraded for the inconvenience not the other way around. Everybody at the customer service understands but never really solve your problem. Expensive averagelow service poor handling of customer issues.
At checkin we were told that our checked baggage was too heavy limit 8kg17lbs even though the website said 23kg50lb limit and we needed to reduce the weight. We were put to the side so we could move our dirty laundry from the suitcases and put into tote bags purchased from the nearby shop that we could carry on. This was both embarrassing and frustrating. The plane was an hour late for our connecting flight. They didnt tell us but fortunately after running through the airport our connection was also late so we did make the plane. They stopped food service short so the last 5 rows didnt get any food. This was not due to weather but just bad timing of the stewards. We still had 30 minutes to land so they could have quickly handed out the sandwiches but they decided not to provide service to the last few rows. I dont know if it was due to poor planning of the start of food service or of taking too much time in the middle rows. Instead of treating us like the rest of the passengers we felt like 3rd class citizens. Very poor service.
Durban to Johannesburg. As a low cost airline in FlySafair you get what you pay for. No inflight entertainment any beverage you want you have to pay seats that dont recline. No USB plug to charge your phone. The really good thing is that the service was really fast. Fast boarding fast disembarking and you got your checked baggage fast.
Older plane and business class seats are 2x2x2 so no wifi on board. However seats are comfortable and have a good recline which is not bad for the short flight from Singapore to Perth. Meals are fantastic especially as we booked the cook the assam fish was one of the best I have ever had. Entertainment selection is decent and inflight shopping selection is wide. Best of all service is impeccable.
Bangkok to Toronto via Hong Kong on the day after New Years. Both flights were full departed on time and arrived Hong Kong and Toronto early. Bangkok to Hong Kong on a regional 777300. Seats were the old shell types. Boarding in Bangkok was chaotic since the gate was poorly laid out not the airlines fault. Seat Though mildly comfortable it wouldnt have been the best for my back if the flight was any longer than what it was 2 hrs 6 minutes. Padding was relatively rough and seat storage was limited. However the positive side is that no one would recline into you. Hong Kong to Toronto on an older 777300ER. Seats were standard of Cathays long haul and made the 14hour flight bearable and comfortable. Catering on both flights improved since my last trip with the ice cream actually edible when handed out. The meals themselves were of adequate portions and tasted standard. Cabin crew were extremely pleasant on both flights going out of their way to accommodate requests despite the turbulence both flights encountered along the way. Overall another great trip with Cathay Pacific and I look forward to flying with them again.
Sydney to Delhi via Kuala Lumpur. I got a great price on the premium flatbed and decided to try it. The seat is an angled flatbed but was remarkably comfortable and I managed to get a good few hours sleep. You also get an Ipad with entertainment and a meal but you have to pay for drinks. The crew were really friendly and efficient. For a budget airline they did a great job. I was surprised at how good the journey was for a 15 hour trip and I didnt feel at all tired when I arrived.
Melbourne to Heathrow via Brunei and Dubai with Royal Brunei. For a relatively small airline and with very competitive prices this airline provide a standard that is hard to criticise. Yes some may not like the 2 stops on this route and no alcohol policy but plenty of others are quite ok with this. When you take into account the new aircraft 787s with 333 seating reasonable food plenty of other drinks served pleasant staff and 30kg baggage allowance on this route overall thie product is worth considering I would certainly use them again. Seats have good room although a little hard as any seat would be after three 7 to 8 hour flights reasonable entertainment system and Bandar Seri Begawan airport is showing signs of growth and improvement with more services.
We were due to fly London to Delhi on 15th November 2018. The tube line to Heathrow was suspended due to a trespasser on the line so we arrived later than planned but we were still there an hour before our scheduled takeoff time. Jet Airways refused to let us check in saying that the gate had closed Even though we were with a tour operator who already had our flight tickets we were denied access and could not check in. We spent 3200 on the tour for a nine nightfive destination tour and we have now lost all our money the insurance company will not pay because they say they will not pay for transport disruption. We have taken this up with the tour operator who say that it is totally down to the airline. Has anyone had any problems like this with Jet Airways before
Worst experience ever. At Phuket the Jetstar Airways crew checked my baggage but not to my final destination explained that its impossible and I would have to check my luggage again. But dropping off my luggage again means taking 2x passport controls and security checks for which I dont have time due to short connections. Now there is a huge risk that my luggage wont come to my final destination. Double check those situations twice. This is very confusing. Im disappointed that the crew did such a thing without checking.
Ho Chi Minh to Buon Me Thuot. One of the worst airline I have ever experienced. This airline is trying to find more ways to make money out of their customers. I would never recommend anyone to use their services. Please save your money and fly with some other airlines
Cape Town to London via Dubai. Budget long haul airline. Starving hungry on a 9.5 hour flight. No movie snacks served. Nothing except a standard lunch after take off and then a disgusting vegetable baked good just before landing. 7 hours daytime flying with no food. What a joke. On the next leg from Dubai dinner was a turkey ham roll and that was it for 7 hours until an inedible breakfast was offered. Cheese and cracker with breakfast Demonstrative of the lack of care and attention by emirates. Dirty planes. Smelly toilets. I will never fly Emirates again. How reviewers are consistently rating Emirates above BA is beyond me and as we know BA is hardly a high benchmark. A massive TV screen and a large selection of films does not make up for a budget service. The cabin crew now start cleaning the plane before it lands collecting blankets etc. When the cabin crew start taking on the cleaners role you know things have gone bad.
Delhi to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. One of the worst flights i have ever been to. Upgraded to a business class with an amount of Rs 27000 for two people. The seats were not reclining the tv screen was not working. And to top it all no food was served even in business class. We were rather uncomfortable even after upgrading it to business. While coming back from bali to delhi we took the economy seats only n to my surprise i found out even the water is chargeable forget the food. And seats were dirty one of the two seats which we took the screen was not working again. The economy class recliner was also not working. Worst experience. Would never recommend anyone to fly from malindo air.
Singapore to Venice via Istanbul. Cabin crew on both legs attentive and friendly. They came to me at the end of both segments to ask whether I liked the service and enjoyed the flight. Old business class seat on the Singapore to Istanbul route this seat type should be removed by Turkish as it is uncompetitive. Had a good sleep though as the space for legs is excellent. Meal quality and quantity great. I was pleased to see that Turkish is testing the dine ondemand concept on the Singapore to Istanbul route. I was told that such a concept will be gradually introduced across all their longhaul flights. Ataturk airport crazy busy as usual looking forward to the opening of the new airport in October. Due to very bad weather over India the first flight landed in Istanbul behind schedule and one of my four luggage did not make it to the final destination. It arrived to Venice with the following flight and was delivered on the same day by the airline directly to my place.
Warsaw to Moscow return. Standard in economy class is better than in LH or LOT. We got a tasty sandwich apple and choco wafel. For drink selection of juices tea coffee were served in Moscow free newspapers and magazines. The aircraft was extremely clean. Flight attendants were very polite and helpful and very well organized however the aircraft was near full. Ground service in Moscow is organized better than in e.g. CDG or Lyon. In all airports you have to wait in the lines for passport control it usually takes about 20 30 minutes but in WAW was 20 also. From the airport is a very comfortable train to the center.
Shameful exploitation. As a seasoned world traveller I have flown with pretty much all of the main carriers and Im pretty sure I flew with Cathay Pacific around 23 years ago to Singapore. So for my upcoming trip to Phuket via Hong Kong we chose to fly with them again not much choice to be honest. Having paid a considerable amount of money to fly with Cathay Pacific this time around I was horrified and extremely disappointed that to reserve seats so that my wife and I could sit together on the 4 flights I had to pay 197.60. This is absolutely daylight robbery How can they justify this much money for reserving 2 seats It costs them nothing... they have already taken 1000s of pounds for my flights and there is no additional administration needed because its all done via computer if fact I received confirmation of my reserved seats straight after Id paid the additional 197.60. It seems to me that they are exploiting a captive audience and playing on the fear of their travellers not being able to sit together on these long haul flights. Shame on you Cathay Pacific This will be the last time I ever fly with CP and I will make it my mission in life to inform my many 1000s of contacts worldwide to do the same Note The date of my flight is the 5th of March 2024 so that I could leave this review I chose todays date.
Very friendly check in staff same goes for the lounge staff however there was only one on the front desk and was tied up selling with upgrades or lounge access which meant that we had a 10 min wait before we got access. Lounge itself was nice and had just been refurbished how ever food selection was average with several things having run out and not replaced. Flight its self was good but due to midnight departure staff were just going through the motions. The beef tenderloin has to be the driest toughest piece of meat to have ever been served on an airplane. Overall I have had better experiences on other carriers. Emirates seems to suffer from hit and miss crew. Plane landed on time and for the price the service was not unreasonable. Still a bit poor that you dont even get a limited amount of wifi in business class.
A new plane with in flight entertainment plane left on time and arrived 12 minutes earlier the crew with a smile. The only complaint was the boarding in a remote stand in Lisbon and we had to stay in the bus before boarding closed for more then 5 minutes.
Last month I had the pleasure of traveling with China Southern Airlines and the experience was phenomenal and their high level of customer service was apparent. The seats were comfortable and spacious contributing to a relaxing flight. The crew was professional and their attentiveness to passenger needs was commendable. The quality of the inflight meals was a pleasant surprise adding to the comfort of the journey. I highly recommend them for any travel plans and look forward to flying with them again in the future.
The Air Niugini food was good for airline food on my flight Port Moresby to Hong Kong and a decent amount of entertainment options as well. If you get seated in row 8 you have a lot of leg room and I am 64. The airlines in the USA should learn how to have entertainment and food from them.
My flight from Heathrow was scheduled on Saturday 101222 at 1400. But this was delayed. As a result I missed my connection flight at Cairo and had to spend over 5 hours at the airport. The staff at the airport were absolutely rude. No explanation no curtesy no respect at all. They simply didnt want to engage with anyone. We were commanded to hand in our passports and the new boarding passes with no explanation at about 2215 PM. At about 0220 AM two staff came back and commanded us to follow them through immigration. We were taken to another area and told to WAIT. After 0300AM a small mini bus arrived and we were told bus to hotel the ride was very uncomfortable with passengers sitting on each others laps. We were served a meal at the hotel and went to sleep. We spent the next day Sunday 111222 at the hotel until 1800PM when were taken back to the airport to catch a flight at 2145PM arriving at my final destination at 0315 AM on 121222. To add to my agony one of my bags was missing so I had to go through more distress completing paper work for missing baggage. The bag was delivered though. The experience has by far been the worst ever especially the appalling customer service. Will never ever use this airline and if anyone intends to use this airline consider your options very carefully after all there is a good choice from other airlines.
Vienna to Lisbon. Awful service besides being delayed when we found our seats it had garbage from previous passengers. We ask the staff to clean it and they said that we had to clean it ourselves.
Istanbul to Athens. Unfortunately the plane was delayed otherwise it was a pleasant flight. I was a bit surprised they didnt offer an alcoholic drink which surprised me for a full service airline. The food offered was a roll which wasnt too bad considering it was a very short flight .
I have been flying all over the world mainly for professional reasons for the last 40 years. Recently I am travelling more for leisure than for work. This is why my son and I decided to fly to Cape Town South Africa recently. We flew from Paris to Cape Town via Doha with Qatar Airways in Business Class and this was probably the best choice as everything went perfect. From the boarding in CDG up to the disembarking in CPT the whole experience was great. The QSuite concept as well as the family suite concept have been very well designed. The attendants service and food and beverages quality are the highest standards I have ever experienced in the industry. For me Qatar Airways is definitely the best airline for Business Class. I could say that Qatar is for me today part of the travel destination decision in the sense that I am prioritizing destinations where Qatar Airways can fly me to
On November 15 2019 I went to Caribbean Airlines website to purchase three tickets to Barbados for 223.20 per ticket. The flights were scheduled to leave around 240 pm on November 15th and arrive in Barbados around 10 pm that same night. I selected three flights with this flight information. When I received confirmation of the flights it stated that the flights would arrive around 9 am the next morning on November 16th. That was not the flight times that I selected. I immediately called Caribbean Airlines Customer Service and informed the representative that there was a mistake with the flight times on the confirmation. I stayed on the phone with her for about five minutes while she looked up my flight information. She instructed me to go to the Caribbean Airlines counter in the Miami Airport and have the Desk Agent change the flights. I waited for about 1.5 hours for this change. The Desk Agent also spoke with her Supervisor and they both worked on changing my flight. After waiting for approximately 1.5 hours at the Caribbean Airlines counter the Desk Agent told me that there are no longer any seats available on the flights that I selected. I requested a full refund at the counter since the flights that I originally selected were not available anymore. I also requested to speak with the Supervisor that was helping her to change the flights. She denied my request and informed me that I would have to call Customer Service again because they do not issue refunds at the counter. She also stated that Customer Service would be able to issue a full refund. I walked away from the counter and called Customer Service. I spoke to a different Customer Service Representative than before. I explained the situation. She informed me that the reason the Desk Agent instructed me to call Customer Service was because the Desk Agent knew that I would NOT be able to get a refund at all. And the Desk Agent didnt want to have a confrontation at the counter. So the Desk Agent passed me back to the Customer Service Department according to the Customer Service Rep. This Customer Service Rep said that she could only issue a flight credit. I stated that I was not interested in a flight credit because it was their error on their part with booking the wrong flights. She told me that the only person able to issue a full refund was a Supervisor. I then requested to speak with a Supervisor. After waiting on hold for 30 minutes the phone line was suddenly disconnected. I thought it was a mistake or maybe a bad signal on my phone. I called Customer Service again and repeated the same situation regarding booking flights for a specific time and the flight confirmation coming back with a different time. I immediately asked to speak with a Supervisor after explaining the situation. This time I waited about 15 minutes on hold and the phone line disconnected again. My phone did not have a bad signal. They purposely disconnected the line to prevent a conversation with a Supervisor who may or may not have been able to resolve the issue. After a second disconnection and hours of trying to have my issue resolved I filed a dispute with American Express to receive a credit for these flights.
Belgrade to Doha. Belgrades airport is small and you cannot get lost. Checking in was fast but my passport needed several scans. First boarder control then security separate at each gate. Business lounge a kind of basic but ok. First time on a Qatar Airways narrow body aircraft. 12 seats in a 22 configuration seat the same as on the airlines A330300. Very comfortable and fully flat really big touch screens. Only the room for the feet on the 2CD and 3CD a little restricted for taller men. Amenity kit without cosmetics but sufficient for a 4 hours 40 minutes flight time. Food and drink menu superbe as always. Not much difference in comfort in comparison to a wide body aircraft.
This is not a premium airline anymore. The days of Emirates being a premium airline are long gone. By now their planes are old seats and Inflight entertainment systems are broken. On the way up to Dubai 2 out of three seats has sound only in 1 ear. And one seat could not stay in position. The touch screen did not work. On the way back 1 seat and 1 sound system did not work out of three. They charge heavily for wifi and they charge significantly for a seat in front. At a rate where other airlines offer premium economy Emirates just let you sit a couple of seats in front. European and US carriers by now have closed the gap and surpassed Emirates offering better wifi premium economy and more innovative entertainment systems Delta lets you watch from your own iPad. KLM flies this route with brand new 787s. But where an airline should make the real difference Emirates fails even harder. Service. They get stuck in organizational bureaucracy. Emirates call centre gave you the wrong information Your problem. That issue cost 200 euros Your problem. The manager says no. Can I speak to that manager No. Selfservice checkin doesnt work Your problem. Go stand in another line of selfservice machines. Still doesnt work Your problem. Go stand in the back of the line at the classic checkin counter after spending 30 mins waiting for machines that dont work Cant check you in before you do a covid fast test. Go to a very badly signed fast test area. Everybody there is already checked in Being around the self checkin Machines gives you a true to life Ryanair experience but Ryanair actually does a better job. People with issues all over. And this is covid times with a lot less traffic. I wonder what happens when it becomes busier.
Air Madagascar cancelled the initial flight from Bangkok and moved it to the following day without warning or explanation. They did provide accommodation and the flight was ok. Our next flight with Air Madagascar was then a domestic one a week later Antananarivo to Sante Marie. This was overpriced at 500 euro pp for a one hour flight. Without any warning the flight was moved to 4 hours earlier. Air Madagascar acknowledged that we confirmed our flight 24 hours prior and that they provided no warning of the change and no replacement flight. Due to the cancellation of this flight our return flight booking to Bangkok was wiped from their system without warning. We had to frantically arrange a ticket with minutes to spare. 3 flights with Air Madagascar and 3 stressful and very poor experiences
Nice flight good crew very good seat food was what you would expect. The aircraft had the new style Business Class seatssuite the actual plane as not new in any since of the word. There were parts of the seat that were broken or missing however the seat still sat well and worked. Seat was also long enough to really lay out and get some sleep. The video system worked great and had plenty of content. The headphones however were cheap and didnt feel or work particular good. The layout on this 773 had a lot of business class seats a lot We sat in the forward cabin enter aircraft turn left and that cabin is the quieter part of the aircraft. The crew was very nice and were there the entire time for any needs or wants we might have had. One draw back to the seats is as we were traveling as a couple the middle divider didnt open enough to really feel like you and your mate are traveling together. LHR is what it is crowded and expansive but we had a good lounge visit and were completely on time for all flights.
Moscow to Tashkent. Our plane was broken. We were 26 hours in airport without hotel and proper food. We could not leave the airport because flight was delayed every 30 min. They promised to fly immediately during 26 hours We even could not finally enter the plane which came instead of our one Uzbekistan Airways simply forgot to reissue our boarding passes. We had a nightmare crush during boarding because new plane was smaller vs previous one. We even had an issues with police finally air company refused us in any compensation.
I often use S7 for short hops between Kiev and Moscow. They manage to serve hot dinner on such a short flight. Their planes are new and in good condition. Online purchase and checkin as well as intown checkin in Moscow work fine. Good choice and good value for money. The only minus is that they are always 3040 minutes behind schedule.
Hong Hong to Budapest via Shanghai. Flew on A320 on HKG to Shanghai while in a newer B7879 on the long haul to Budapest. China Eastern marketed flights. The long haul leg was flown by their daughter company Shanghai Airlines to Budapest. Amazing experience pure adventure. Bought this ticket some months earlier for the high season to Europe as a huge bargain for 347 USD including 2 x 23 kg of luggage which is welcomed near Xmas. It costed me in addition positioning and depositioning flights to which I volunteered as I needed the extra miles for my elite status. However I was notified 2 months before travel by my online travel agent Travelgenio that the return flight from Budapest was preponed by 1 hour. Then I was forced to change as I would not be able to arrive in time for the new departure. I then decided to change plans completely and celebrate New Year in Budapest instead of Vietnam. Thus I postponed my return travel from Budapest by 3 days. This was done by emails to the Travel Agent no response and then phone calls to Ch. Eastern in Brisbane and Shanghai. Eventually it went smoothly and I was changed to my wish without added costs apart from changing onward flights beyond Hong Kong with another airline. That even allowed me to do another cheap detour to Hanoi on my way back to Hue. The homepages of China Eastern and Shanghai are difficult to penetrate and to book or change bookings from. Unless one has a Chinese telephone number. However 10 days before departure I could access seating and chose freely my favourite seats even got 1 of 4 legs in exit seat. However one cannot access the entire booking unless registered with CEs flyer program in which I am not interested. Apart from that it was a good adventure a complicated travel where everything could have gone wrong but all went smooth. Arrived in Hongkong early and was able to checkin 6 hours before departure as the airline have many departures daily. No queues at the checkin and the ground staff were good and answered questions though fearing speaking English. Two BPs issued immediately. Flying HKGPVG is considered as international flights though it could be considered as domestic. That give the advantage of not leaving transit while leaving HKG and passing PVG. First flight was on an aged A320. Extremely controlled and organised priority boarding at gate where all business and elite flyers were boarding entirely before the remaining passengers. Onboard newspapers and 10 channels of music were offered bring own headset. Shared monitors showed some educational movies. Food was limited to a tidy pack of biscuits. Drinks were unlimited water tea coffee beers but only for 1 hour out of the 212 hour long flight during ascend and descend all services were closed down until 40 Minutes after kickoff and again 40 Minutes before landing. That leaves passengers with very limited time of service. FAs were fine. The second flight were by Shanghai Airlines Boeing 787. It was a very positive surprise and was faultless. Modern aircraft good food and service 2 hot meals offered at dinner and then again at breakfast. Frequent drink rounds. Button calls answered quickly and needs were addressed instantly. Individual IFE on touchscreen monitors was very easy and quick to operate with a good number of Western and English translated movies. Toilets clean. Both flights took off earlier than scheduled.
Dublin to London City on 2nd November flight was cancelled due to fog queued for 3 hours for a rebooking only to be offered a flight on the following evening when fog was due again in London. Refund could not be processed by staff in the airport so I had to phone the call centre. Two weeks later and I still have not received a refund. Booked Ryanair for the following day and even though it was last minute it was still cheaper than my original cancelled BA flight. Reluctant to pay a premium to fly British Airways again.
American Airlines canceled the flight my wife and I were scheduled on we sat at the ORF airport for five plus hours waiting for it delay after delay. We were informed it was canceled due to the incoming flight crew from New York being unable to continue on with our fight due to the delays it incurred. While there getting the bad news with everyone else we overheard a lady mention that this was the third day in a row the same American Airlines flight had been canceled on her. Due to American Airlines inability to plan ahead and swap flight crews to enable us to fly later that evening when the plane did arrive it caused us to have to cancel our vacation entirely. When we called American Airlines directly after we were told the flight was canceled a representative told us they could not get us on another flight to our destination within the next few days. The customer service rep did slip up and say there was another flight with seats on it the next day but the seats were marked up to 4K each and he told us he could not put us on that fight Due to American Airlines inability to plan ahead or get us on the next flight I was not able to see my Daughter who flew out of Houston to see us my brother and his children or my Mom and StepDad all of whom I have not seen for over a year. I am in the Military and nothing is more disappointing than not getting to see my family the few times a year I can especially when its due to an airline company failing to uphold their end of a ticket purchase Also due to the lastminute flight cancelation the nonrefundable costs we incurred include TWA hotel JFK our portion of the destination accommodations and Airport parking for the day we waisted sitting there. My brother also flew American weeks before and had his flight canceled on him two times before he finally made it to his destination. The customer service was horrible when we were on the phone they did nothing to assist us and were not able to answer most of the questions we had pertaining to our cancelled flight My advice is dont fly American unless you are prepared to have a week of delays in getting to your destination it appears this is quickly becoming their standard operating procedure.
I had to fly with Air Caraibes to Paris to connect back to Canada as due to COVID there are no Canadian directs. I initially chose Air Caraibes because the flight was ridiculously cheap only 150 for a transatlantic flight The airport and gate were typical for a midsized Caribbean airport it had what I needed but nothing more. When I first saw the plane I realized how brand new it looked it was an A3501000. Getting on board the modern feel of the cabin was obvious. I had a seat in the very back row but still the seat was comfortable and it had aboveaverage legroom. It came with your usual screen equipped with a good number of entertainment options. What really caught my eye with the screens though was the exterior cameras. I had a middle row so it was amazing to still be able to watch the takeoff from a tailfinmounted camera and now I wish every plane had that The food was excellent there was only one option as far as I could tell but I did really enjoy the food yet it was simple enough that most people would like at least some portion of it. Communicating with staff went fine with the basic amount of French I know as a Canadian and anyone who complains about them not speaking English is obviously a little selfcentred and doesnt realize that this is a local Caribbean airline serving only French locations they shouldnt have to learn English to help out the 1 American traveller on a flight. Even with all of that all of the gate announcements and inflight announcements were also said in English so I dont really get how this could be much of a problem. I will say that it was unfortunate that their main website had an English page but the booking screen was only in French but again I dont really hold it against them and got it booked with a little help from Google Translate. If you cant handle that just book it from Expedia or something. All in all this Air Caraibes flight might just have been the best Economy experience that Ive ever had and I would definitely fly with them again especially if the price stays that amazing
Open Skies cancelled my departure flight booked 3 months in advance without notifying me. I found out three days before departure when I tried to choose my seats on line. They only offered cancellation or a move of departure flight one day later no options earlier. Changing the return flight was not possible. Very inconvenient very disappointing.
The crew service is not up to standard anymore. I am really disappointed as when my plane was diverted from my original arrival location I ask for details from one of the crew but only being answered unprofessionally with jokes and no respect. I just wanted to know how the process was and needed assistance on do we fly back to original location as this my first experience as my plane being diverted.
My flight G82519 from New Delhi DEL to Nagpur NAG on 30062020 was cancelled by GoAir. I asked for a refund. But they havent replied yet. I even forwarded the email to the GoAir Nodal Officer but havent heard from them. They forwarded me a tax invoice and a credit note I do not know what to do with it. They do not have even the basic courtesy of at least responding. I have been waiting for the last 10 days. I do not want a credit notevoucher I just want my refund amount because the flight was cancelled at their end they failed to provide me a service which they charged me for.
Horrible customer service. Awful Lounge and foodsnacks. Need to pay for headphones. Uncomfortable seats. Did not honor Star Alliance Gold benefits baggage allowance.
On recommendation chanced my arm with a standby seat for the onward flight to Chiang Mai. With three planes departing within 10 minutes of one another Nok Air secured my business for no other reason than it had the shortest queue at the ticket counter. Straightforward to purchase the price 1500 Baht little different to that available for an advance booking providing you stick to the 15kg baggage limit. Rapid checkin but few minutes late departing and arriving. By chance sat in an emergency exit premium seat no extra cost so ample room and offered drinks during the flight. Smart nearly brand new plane. Bags delivered as I arrived at the carousel after short walk from airbridge walking directly out of the airport.
Premium economy worse than most airlines economy. Unprofessional staff uncomfortable seats foot rest but no leg rest very little seat recline and difficult to operate. Rubbish food very poor landing and everything went flying. Additionally we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people. These premium economy seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos. Other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light not BA. Even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup. This was the second leg on a flight from Sydney via LAX so we were beyond tired. When an attendant picked up my sons water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight he didnt hear my son say thanks which he had so the attendant said pointedly Youre welcome rude and laughed about it with the passenger next to him. In my experience better and cheaper premium economy can be found with Norwegian Air New Zealand and American Airlines all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge. Ive never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with British Airways Ive never had a good experience.
A delay of 90 minutes. I still managed to arrive in time for my connection but we had barely time to rest in Doha. 90 minutes transit time to get across the terminal to the next gate instead of 3 hours transit.
This is the worst experience I have had with Qantas and in Sydney Airport. The food was terrible and the service was shocking particularly being 7 months pregnant with no assistance from staff. Not only that we had to wait at the gate for an hour before we could get off the aircraft despite landing. Then luggage took over an hour to arrive which made the transport I organised useless. All this due to the lack of preparation from the airline and airport. Ruined what should have been a joy to come home.
Bangkok to Kathmandu. Arrived today to the airport and was asked to pay 8500 baht over 200 for 17kg luggage. On the booking process there was no option to buy a luggage so I assumed its free. The staff was rude and there was no way to lower the fee. Most of the people just decided to pay. I did not. Am now in Bangkok awaiting for Nepal Airlines to take me to Kathmandu. Similar cost as the baggage but at least I have satisfaction not paying a penny to this. Never again.
What a fantastic flight. Premium seats comfortable. The food was lovely and presented in a premium style. Cabin Manager Sandra and her team were fantastic and very attentive. Thank you for the wonderful experience.
Really bad airline. Rather than provided accurate information eg flight is delayed until x just kept providing an estimate of when the flight is to land. Never ever been on a flight with them that is on time. Very unreliable airline.
My wife and I flew to Brisbane from Auckland and return. A350 was roomy and comfortable in Economy Class. Crew were friendly. IFE with a good selection of movies TV and music. Crew on return flight indifferent and sour. Meals were awful spiced chicken and rice worse than a microwavable meal from the supermarket. In summary crew need to lift their game. English is often poor and engagement nowhere near Singapore Airlines.
This review is specifically about Maddie crew member who took care of us. She was attentive warm friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Smiling from start to finish. She should be the brand ambassador for BA.
My mother in law who is 88 years old was booked to go to Durban as an assisted passenger. At Or Tambo airport a Safair staff member escorted her to the boarding area of the plane. When she got to Durban she and an elderly couple who were also as assisted passengers waited on board to be helped out the plane. This service was not forthcoming by the cabin crew. They decided to then disembark by themselves because they were not attended to. When my mother in law went to collect her luggage which was supposed to be on carousel 4 it was nowhere to be found she was given the run around on the collection area. Eventually it was found on carousel 1 imagine a frail 88 year old person trying to take her luggage of the carousel by herself she could have fallen and injured herself. She was traumatized and disrespected in this process. This could have been prevented if Safair cabin crew had done their jobs and escorted her and the other elderly couple of the plane. Shame on you Safair for poor service and disrespecting elderly people wheres your sense of Ubunyi
The boarding time started 10 mn before the flight. The customers of 3 different planes at almost same time departure were passing the security and I got through while the boarding time already started. I had my mountain crampons in my carry on luggage. They did not want me to get on the plane with that I can understand make me wait more than 5 minutes before to get me out and did not help me too find a solution. No one moved. I missed the flight because of their incapacity of reaction. I was not refund neither offered to get in another one. My way back was also no refund. The staff did not care more especially after having checking that I took a basic plan. It is not cheap as it seems according the mess at the boarding time the non professionalism of their employees. I am still chocked that they make me lose 12120 JPY and that it is just about the flight itself to be add transportation inout airport hotel reservation sadness to see all my plans crushed. And that with a bit more of reaction they will have guide me to a locker asap and meme my travel possible.
We take multiple longhaul trips every year with Turkish Airlines flying in Business Class. Reliable good service flights generally ontime catering consistently good if not exquisite our preference over Qatar Airways and ANA for food Flying Chefs and menus definitely Turkishs calling card flight attendants generally warm and solicitous and downright playful especially if you lead with a smile. Highly recommended.
Toronto to Taipei via Tokyo. EVA Air was the first Asian carrier Ive flown on and my first experience in longhaul business class. From this point I am completely sold on them. The quality of the service and food on both my flights was fantastic. The cabin crew in Business Class are very attentive and quickly are at your seat as soon as your glass or plate is empty with another drink or meal course. As someone who works in the aviation industry I am all too familiar with the intricacies of an airline from frontline to behindthescenes. All four of my flights departed on time and when faced with a difficult situation arriving 35 minutes prior to departure due to an airportaccess issue the ground staff were accommodating and whisked me through security. Surprisingly my baggage also made the flight which was something I was concerned with. If I had to find a negative it would unfortunately be the Plaza Premium lounge EVA Air uses in Toronto. This lounge was extremely basic and the fooddrink options were minimal. For an airline who prides themselves on their quality Id have expected them to opt for a better lounge option. On the other hand their Infinity Lounge in Taipei was the complete opposite obviously being that it is at their hub they have more control with ample food drink and comfort options.
Flight Attendants were good but their guest experience customer service team is horrible. Long wait time and generic responses and lack of empathy Being in customer service emotional intelligence is important. Another thing to note if they offer you travel vouchers due to flight cancellations or rescheduling BE Careful. They misrepresented by not telling me full info when I opted for voucher and when I tried to redeem a 20 meal they took my flight amount.
I was initially concerned after I booked my tickets due to the reviews. This is my experience flying direct from Tampa to Norfolk and then Norfolk to Tampa a week later. I fly first thing in the morning and sat in the Nicer seats. Overall no issues with the flight. The boarding process was very easy and go the seat with no problem. If you are a bigger person you may need a seat belt extender. Just ask the flight crew right when you step on and they will give you one before heading to the seat. Once boarded the captain came out and spoke with the cabin and explained the flight. We took off on time and landed 20 minutes early. The fight was very smooth and couldnt have been happier. There are inflight refreshments but unless you are in the Nicest seats cost money. I flew back to Tampa in the Nicest seats and WOW what an upgrade. For an extra fifty bucks having the extra width and leg room was fantastic. I sat in row 1 which provide extra leg room and at 64 was more room then really needed. The seats are comfortable and have a reclining feature with a foot leg rest. Inflight refreshments come with the seat which include a can of soda and other beverages and snacks. The snacks are not the little airplane snacks but large bags of chips candy and energy bars. Overall the staff was fantastic. The inflight stewards were professional and very nice and accommodating. The gate staff were also professional and prompt to load flights and get people on. The only things to remember No in free inflight refreshments. Depending on your seat you will be allowed a personal item carry on or loaded bag. Some seats only allow a small personal item and a carryon bag will cost extra. Also I think the reviews related to delay flight and issues relate to a very limited number of aircraft. I was the only Breeze flight at the terminal of the flight was cancelled there would be no other alternative so there is a inherent risk you are taking. They do not have the plane inventory like Delta or AA and can accommodate a change. Also they fly on certain days and times from the airports. When scheduling makes sure to schedule a flight that has another flight the next day just in case there is a issue.
My wife and I traveled to Phuket in September 2015. After travelling for over 24 hours we arrived in Singapore to find that Jetstar Asia had cancelled our flight from Singapore to Phuket for no apparent reason. We had to purchase new tickets at more than double the original cost. After returning home we have been trying to get refunds for these flights that we paid for twice. Jetstar Asia has largely ignored our requests for months now. Their customer service has been absolutely terrible and I would recommend that you avoid using this airline.
Our British Airways flight to MIA departed on time and was full. We were seated in the middle front row which has extra legroom and the IFE screens and traytables are stored in the seats. The first thing that caught our attention was the state of the cabin and the interior looked old and worn. The same goes for the IFE and seats. Although the seats were comfortable by form and shape they were worn and a bit hard to sit on. I had trouble with my IFE the whole flight as it froze and continuously reset itself while trying to watch a movie. That was very annoying but the cabin crew reset the system a couple of times and werent annoyed by my questions about the problem. The cabin crew service was excellent as was food.
I visit my parents regularly in Paris I always use Air France Transavia or Middle east airlines. But today was the first and last flight with this Aigle Azur. On the passport my name is Ludovic while on the ticket its Ludwig. The family name is the same. So because of 3 letters difference they want to charge 80 euros. Why changing 3 letters cost 80EUR This is how you lose passengers.
Birmingham to Johannesburg via Dubai. We paid extra so my wife and I could sit together. On the way home they allocated us to different seats. Wed booked window seats and they put us on each flight in the centre of the plane. I am just getting fed up with trying to get a refund for the money we paid 80. Just phoned them again and the customer service rep was just rude. I will never fly with this airline again. I thought Emirates were going to be superior but they are simply nothing special at in any department. Two months trying to get your money back due to their effective management of seating is dreadful. So be warned if you are thinking of booking seats and paying 20 each person per seat per flight.
Cancelled with No Explanation. Flight 2936 leaving San diego june 28 Wednesday Arriving in Phoenix June 29 Thursday. First it was delayed once for approximately 45 minutes then received another email it was being delayed for another 35 minutes Then after waiting for an extra 2 hours Intercom came on And Said Flight 2936 was Canceled. Head downstairs to rebook. But they forgot to Mention the next Available Flight to Phoenix was 2 days later On Saturday July 1st. Had to rent a car get Hotel room that night 600.00 later. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again.
Flight 2 hours delayed. Lost check baggage no update cannot even locate the bag. Customer service useless on hold for 1h and got hung up then another 1h on hold for an agent that barely speaks English and that cannot do anything about it. Overpriced overall between adding checked bag carryon bag and food as well as very bad food selection. Doesnt even give you water. They charged me an extra 20 for a seat selection I never selected and end up in the middle seat the worst one. At the counter they forgot to print my boarding pass and didnt give it to me so I had to come back. The staff are not well trained they didnt know anything about filing a report for missing luggage and they barely understood English or French making communication even ore difficult. Overall dont waste your time and fly with another company
Gatwick to Hong Kong. Im a CX gold card and lounge access at BA given. Boarding fast lovely welcome seat in PE great loads of space. Food really tasty snacks noodles delivered quickly. Captain informative and after slight delay we arrived on time. Crew are good a lot is expected of them and they deliver. Big negative is new print off your ticket and bag tags procedure. Its not that clear how.
EINLCYEIN in F50s. The service in both directions was of the usual high quality I would expect from the old VLM CityJet routes. The cabin crew were polite and professional and even recognised and welcomed returning passengers. The captain kept us well informed of our progress. For the fare I consider this exceptionally good value however they should encourage the ground staff at both airports to improve their attitude about keeping passengers informed.
I have always been a fan because of the GatwickFlorence link but after the third consecutive disaster no more. Gatwicks departures website had the flight as severely delayed but BA kept saying they knew nothing about a delay and would not rebook. The Meridiana rep had just gone home and not bothered to tell BA.
You do not get refreshments and inflight amenities. Youre getting what you pay for affordable transportation. Avelo flies to and from small regional airports that arent serviced or are under serviced by larger carriers and do not have daily service. Checkin was easy on the website. I did elect to pay for seat selection and the 14 was worth have a row to myself. The incoming flight from New Haven was late. So boarding was delayed but the flight itself was not. Quick turnaround time by the staff. The plane is an older 737. The planes do have different cabin configurations. This one had the smaller and harder seats. Still better than Spirit but a similar quality. Took off without issue. The flight itself was uneventful. Unfortunately the weather in CT did not agree with this. It was incredibly windy with a pretty severe amount of turbulence. We had two missed approached and held over the LIS for about an hour. The pilots informed us what was going on after the second attempt when we entered the holding pattern. Unfortunately that was not a particularly fun hour with the turbulence over the water. I fly often and am not a particularly nervuous flier but I was not comfortable. Be advised at New Haven we had airstairs and had to walk off the ramp and I did not check luggage but luggage claim at Tweed if outside. Traffic at Tweed was horrendous and the airport itself needs to address that if theyre going to have commercial flights. You get what you pay for. Extremely economic transportation in and out of rarely serviced airports. Would fly again.
When i used the web portal of brussels airlines for purchase i noticed that each time the web page was reloaded the prices went up. Since the payment procedure each time got blocked issue with the backend server that brussels airline side and the purchase procedure had to be restarted the price of the particular flight i wanted to book went up from 223 Euro to 248 Euros. This looks like unacceptable sales practices to drive up the prices of the flight.
US Airways Express. We arrived very early for an afternoon flight and asked if possible to change to earlier flight. Customer service lady very kind and helpful changed it to 11.15 am flight no extra charge. Boarding smoothly small plane. Allocated 2 seats and prefer that configuration. Only 1 flight attendant with a good sence of humour. We were unaware that flight from Philadelphia to New York was only 19 minutes so quickest flight we have ever been on. Only negative is we prefer life jackets in case of emergency not flotation cushions on bottom of seats. The main thing is we arrived safely.
My husband and I used British Airways to fly from London to Paris this past August. When we arrived at airport we needed to pay for bags was charged 4 times for one bag after I was assured charges didnt go through. Have been trying to get a refund from BA since. They give you a phone number to call for these claims only to never answer the phone They have you do a claim online only to never respond to your emails. I sent them the bank statements and credit card statement showing that I had been charged 4 times for one bag. Only 2 months later did they finally respond to the claim claiming I had two bags and despite the fact that I sent documentation showing 4 charges and confirmed with bank and credit card that the charges had gone through they only saw two charges and since I had two bags they didnt owe me any money. They force you to communicate via email and then dont respond they owe me 258 USD and refuse to give me my money at this point.
If you want to wait 23 extra hours due to delayed flights AirAsia Philippines is the airline for you. Along with my boyfriend we experienced at least a two hour delay each way from Manila to Puerto Princesa and back. The flight attendants are kind however all of the check in staff from Puerto Princesa airport were rude and careless. Even though you save a couple bucks with this airline save yourself and book with a different airline even if it costs a few extra dollars.
It was an exhilarating experience for my wife and I to fly Qatar Airways in July 2020 and again in March 2021. By all means with our international travel of over 50 years we rate Qatar Airways to be the front runner and the best. Each aspect of air travel is superb from booking through check in baggage handling and most of all the inflight services. The cabin crew is the icing on the cake. We love Qatar Airways which will be our 1 priority whenever we travel international
Very nice and pleasant flight with LOT on this route comfortable seats. Flight took 40 mins the boarding was fast. Was given a free drink and snack despite the very short flight. Overall highly recommend this airline on this route
Bangkok to Johannesburg via Dubai. This must have been the worst booking experience and customer service of my life. My partner and I booked the exact same route at the exact same time from 2 different laptops directly from the Emirates website. Emirates confirmed they received his payment the money was out of his account but part of his flight is not yet confirmed. After a couple of attempts they made some adjustments and sorted out the issue a few hours later. My booking could not process payment due to a pricing problem between the airlines. After numerous failed attempts over 3 days via customer service and live chats failed rebooking attempts for the same route and empty promises from customer agents calling me back I finally just booked another date to ensure that we can at least spend Christmas together. NEVER in my life have I experienced any issues like this with Qatar or any other airlines for that matter. Emirates advertise routes and when it comes to booking theyre not able to process and if they do process they do a halfass job which leaves customers feeling stressed and running around trying to finalize flight details. Avoid avoid avoid is all I can say. There is a reason Qatar airways is 5 star and Emirates is 4 star.
London to Kuwait via Bangkok. They emailed me a change of flight. The rescheduled flight took off from Kuwait three hours before I landed there. The seats on the plane were very comfortable so I decided to fly with them again. They have turned down three attempts to purchase two tickets online with three different credit cards which work everywhere else. I called their main office in Kuwait We cannot help you or sell you tickets. Send an email. I sent two emails one to Kuwait Airways and one to OASIS membership. Kuwait Airlines told me to phone the Kuwait office. OASIS memmbership told me to phone the Kuwait office or email Kuwait Airlines. Never met a company before who just do not want my money.
Delhi to Dubai. Seats were comfortable and had good leg space. The air conditioning and cabin lights were good. The staff service was good. The food provided was a snacks box but for the price we booked. its justified. Flight took off late by 50 minutes that was a disappointment.
Tokyo to Taipei. First the flight was delayed at the gate after boarding for more than 45 minutes taxi for another 30 minutes. So the plane was late leaving and late arriving in Taiwan. The food was so so for business class really it could have been better. Gate staff also were not well organized. It is surprising for Japan. The lack of signs at the airport gate area and the size of the gate area were terrible. Passengers did not know which lines to go to and business and first class passengers also had to fight through the crowd to board. The biggest problem with the flight was a screaming infant across the isle. Flight attendants did nothing. The parents and grandparents also did nothing. It was horrifying. People should not be traveling with infants period for any reason unless they are moving abroad These were typical selfish parents who insist to travel with their family and could careless about other people. The flight was full and their kid was crying the whole time. Which means their kid was not comfortable. This selfishness has to stop and airline staff and airlines need to address it instead of ignoring it. I paid good money for a business class seat and yet I had to endure this nonsense the entire flight. I am sympathetic in most cases where a kid may act out for a short period of time but this was ridiculous.
Pros Direct flight from Barcelona to Tbilisi. Competitive prices. Aircraft is comfortable. Cons Cant choose your meal No inflight entertainment. Aircraft is rather small Embraer 190 yet comfortable. Cant beat direct flights and good prices other than that it just feels like a cheap lowcost airline but still my preferred option for my location.
Plane holds 17 people. They overbooked the flight and 4peices of luggage made it on the aircraft. The plane was an hour late. Half of the passengers had a 100pm international connecting flight to the USA. The plane touched down at 1220pm. Noone got there luggage. Very unorganized but its the only access to little Cayman.
Baku to Tbilisi. I had a terrible experience with Buta Airways. Firstly flight was delayed 3 hours for no reason. Then at checkin I was fined for not checking in online however there is no mention on the ticket or confirmation email anywhere that you need to do online checkin. I asked for a window seat and was given an Aisle when I asked to move onboard as the flight wasnt full I was told it would cost 25 They also dont allow any hand luggage apart from a handbag or laptop bag. Not even a plastic bag Now my return flight is also delayed. All in all a very poor experience.
Johannesburg to Port Elizabeth return. Plane was on time staff was fantastic and my granddaughter had a fantastic time as well. Returning to JNB check in at Port Elizabeth airport was a bit hectic but the flying experience was spotless Made a short Port Elizabeth vacation exceptional.
We flew back to London from Vancouver on 12 June. The flight was originally scheduled to take off at 1925 we got the message of delay for an hour in that morning then another delay and another one due to their not being able to get a plane there. By the time it took off from Vancouver it was after midnight. I was so tired and went straight to sleep. When I woke up it was breakfast time and all I got was a croissant in plastic bag and a small yoghurt. I wrote to complain and try to get compensation from them and they wrote back 3 days later to say you are not eligible to receive any compensation. Not a single word to apologize for the misery I went through.
Travelled today on a short flight into Gatwick form Verona. Crew first class courteous and offered good inflight service. For a so called low cost carrier Monarch reigns supreme in all aspects of customer care. It is a pity they do not operate on some longer flights. Keep up the good work.
Phnom Penh to Siem Reap with Bassaka Air and I found this airline to be brilliant in all aspects. Their prices are phenomenal and I couldnt complain about anything. Check in was super fast and done with a smile. The plane is a little outdated but its still new and growing. The flight itself was 30 mins and for such a short flight you even got a complimentary drink.
Completely awful They were 4 hours late then they had problem boarding and that took another 45 mins. I missed my original connection ISTBKK. The new connection required 6 hours overly. The worst airline in 30 yrs since I have been flying. Avoid this airline at all costs.
London to Kuala Lumpur. Better than I was expecting after reading the other reviews. The seats are great and service was very friendly on this leg less so on the return. A few areas need improvement 1 Separate toilets from economy 2 Dedicated crew for the premium economy section rather than added onto their economy service. 3 A better 2nd meal The main meal was great and noticeably more premium however the next meal breakfast was a bit of an afterthought. Would I choose BA premium Eco again Yes Definitely.
I travelled from Bangalore to Visakhapatnam with my 2 kids. What could have ended up in a travel disaster was quickly turned around by the ground staff into a memorable trip. While the flight was comfortable checkin during the peak hours airport rush took me for a ride. With kids I arrived a bit late and the counter was closed. The groundcheckin staff found an opportunity to fit us in and they did the unthinkable. Everything happened with lightning speed and we were on the flight finally with few mins to spare. I really appreciate their hard work and very thankful for the VIP treatment. Although the baggage arrived a bit late Its not a big concern at all. I really wish them all the success and growth in their future endeavours.
As my flight was when Thailand was in lockdown i tried to find information on what to do in Bangkok as we were stopping there I tried finding information and I tried contacting Thai airways before leaving. Absolutely impossible. They never answer to emails and they never picked up the phone after dozens of attempts. Luckily if youre a bit savvy you can find the website. But for the layman good luck because Thai airways aint gonna help you. We took 4 flights with Thai in total. Out of those my seat was broken on two of them. When I let the onboard crew know it was like I was speaking gibberish. No care factor at all. Credit where credit is due at least some of the crew were very nice and accommodating. During our flight back my bag was absolutely smashed. It was peeling all over the place and a wheel had been knocked off. As well as my wifes brand new bag was also scratched to within an inch of its life. Unfortunately we made the mistake of not properly inspecting them before going to security at Sydney airport. Because it didnt matter however much I tried to contact Thai airways afterwards theyre just as impossible to contact. I even filled out their online form the day after. And when I finally got in contact with the Thai airways cargo email at Sydney airport I got to talk to someone. Regardless just as fruitless as everything else with Thai airways so far. Claimed that I hadnt filled out the form and that I was out of luck. So essentially because theyre having whatever issues with their shitty website thats my fault and my bag wont get fixed. Flying is usually never fun. But this experience has been the worst Ive ever had by far. And the worst part I wouldve come back if they had just replaced my 100 bag. But Thai would rather lose two customers permanently. Couldnt recommend them.
14 April 2014. AA4223 from Chicago to St Louis. The new plane is good. 2x2 seats a line with leather seating. They know the plane is full and there wont be enough space for carry on luggage so encourage people to check in bags for free and preboard.
Vancouver to Manila via Xiamen. Horrible service and no English. They lost my bags and didnt give compensation. 15 refund on being refused boarding without a reason. Worst airline. They pretend they cant understand English and care less about foreign travellers. Intentionally belligerent towards us.
We traveled from Dusseldorf to Milano Linate with Air Berlin. The service on board of the Airbus aircraft was good. They offered a drink and a sweet or salty snack for free. Furthermore we recieved a chocolate heart. The biggest downside of this flight was the delay of 2.5 hours due to this we lost a lot of time which we wanted to spend in Italy. The seats were comfortable and the leg space was also reasonable. The cabin crew was friendly and highly motivated.
My flight from Amsterdam to Lisbon was cancelled three hours before departure when I was already at the airport. Even though TAP had my email address and telephone number there was no further communication at all. It was only when I logged in with my booking reference that I saw that I had been rebooked to leave very early the following morning with a layover in Munich. That would take me nine hours. No hotel voucher was offered and I decided to cancel my trip. The TAP website was totally unhelpful for this and I had to wait for 30 minutes in the queue for a telephonic help desk. It was only then that I managed to cancel and request a refund. We are now three weeks on and there have been no messages or refunds from TAP so far. No contact data are provided to make enquiries about the refund. I consider my money lost.
Due to bad weather in New York at least 30 passengers got delayed. Air Serbia did not find appropriate to have their desk opened at least 15 minutes later to allow us all to board the plane. Worst of all we printed their boarding passes at home and when we showed them to security at JFK they were not valid what a joke. Never again. So many nice airlines around and I am trying to use Air Serbia just from patriotic reasons. They do not deserve to even consider them as an option.
HGHHKG return in March. Good flights and safety conscience crew with good updates from the flight deck. Aircraft had decent legroom and food was ok except they ran out of the western option when the flight was only around 60 full but with only a 2hr flying time its not really an issue.
This was the first time that someone has charged me to carry my musical instruments. I mean the ticket was 3000 rupees and I checked in 3 instruments they charged 1500 per instrument. Its not over yet these people have a policy in which they allow only one bag per person but the weight that is allowed in is 15 kg so if you are wondering if you can carry 2 bags one of 10kg and one of 5 theyll merely refuse to take it. Now the foremost juncture our flight was at 1450 and our motive to visit was met so we decided to go to the airport a bit early and guess what the luggage scanning machine was off there was no representative of Go First we had to ask the representative of the other companies that where are they and I was stricken dumb to hear the reply they said and I quote Go First people will be here in halfhour you guys are early. This was it is the last time Im travelling with this horrible air service. I just want to say one last thing if you budget issue and only this flight is available travel train.
I regret my last trip Kolkata to Dubai. The staff did not even greet. They carried a really bad attitude a zero customer service. The food was left over as I dint like it. The quality of food is not good as before the staff really negative attitude. I really need to think again before I book with Emirates for my next trip.
Rome to London. Thursday May 18 flight scheduled to leave at 1200 delayed due to technical issues for 6 hrs and then cancelled at 1730. This caused missed connecting flight to Los Angeles. Very poor communication with passengers by desk attendants. No one took charge of our situation information filtered through Italian speaking passengers who sought help with staff from Iberia airlines. BA staff was gone after 6pm and we were shuttled to hotel and told a rep would give us further information at hotel. No one from BA was seen or heard from at hotel. Multiple calls by passengers to BA resulted in little to no assistance. Friday May 19 passengers are shuttled back to airport where chaos has broken out because there is little assistance once again at BA counter. After 1 hour in line I obtain a boarding pass on a flight to London with connection to Los Angeles however the BA desk attendant informs me that the flight out of Rome is late due to technical issues and I will once again miss the flight out to LA. Im appalled at the lack of educated experienced BA assistance BA abandoned us at Rome airport. In addition there web site is of no help. Flight information was outdated and impossible to this day to reach customer contact.
Terrible airline. Our flight from Ponta Delgada to Boston cancelled due to plane issues in Boston. We were told that we needed to stay in line until they wrote on names and phone number on a piece of paper then told to leave airport and they would contact us when our new flight would be booked. Waited 24hrs without a call had to return to airport to try to get answers and let them know that 2 of the 4 in my group were diabetic without any more medication due to cancellation. They didnt care at all I had to plea with them to finally get on the plane Monday night from Saturday original flightt. We were not given any compensation for hotels food etc. Cost us in 2 days of hotels additional 400.00
This is by far one of the worst experiences ever. Flight from Maui to LAX was scheduled at 1240pm. When we arrived at the gate we were told it was delayed. Then we were moved to another gate. No one ever provided updates. We sat for hours to later find out the flight was canceled. No one from the airline came out to direct the passengers to next steps. Line for ticketing did not move. Luggage did not come out until 5 hours after the flight had been scheduled to take off. I had to book my own flight out for the next day and book a hotel totalling 1000 for 3 people. This is an additional significant expense and hardship for my family. Who knows if and when I will ever be reimbursed. This airline needs to get it together and have a process for communicating to passengers what the process is in these situations. Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed. This was my first flight ever to Maui and first flight with Hawaiian and Im not sure Ill use this airline ever again.
Singapore to San Francisco. The A350 seats were somewhat closer than the Boeing 777. The seats has the length but does not appear to be as wide. The toilet is very cool with state of the art flushing etc. Normally I am able to sleep well on board but maybe because it is a day flight I suffered from jet lag later in the week. Crew was excellent and attentive to our needs and there were loads of request for food by my fellow passengers.
One of the worst airline customer support I have ever encountered. Until now living in Singapore was spotless but Jetstar has ruined that. I booked the flight wrongly and tried to cancel the booking under 1 hour which is also their 1hourfix policy condition. Unfortunately Jetstar did everything so I couldnt use this policy. I was unable to cancel the booking on the website no option to cancel or change the destination call the customer service to ask the same it was outside of their working hours or get any meaningful support from their virtual assistant refering me to the same website that cannot execute the 1hourfix policy. When I called them the next morning they refused to cancel my booking and required me to pay the change fee if I wanted to change. So their 1hourfix policy only works between 6AM and 10 PM when their phone customer support works. Makes me really sad and hurt to see that these kinds of things can happen in lovely Singapore.
ARNTLL ERJ170 Equipment. This is the airline where you are never met with a smile. Short flight in an old Finnair ERJ170. The seat Comfort is horrible feels like you have a stick in your back all the time. The crew tries to sell you extremely expensive instant coffee for 4 Euros a cup. I was quite impressed that the two cabin crew never managed to smile once during the 50 min flight. This is however the Baltic States best airline. That tells you how bad the other ones are.
Only a two hour flight from Phnom Penh to Yangon so food and drink while OK was limited. Was very impressed with Emirates based on Plane appeared to be new and very clean. Very friendlyprofessional attitude of all cabin crew. Excellent IFE good choice of moviesgames etc and very big screen. Return flight was just as good. Would definitely recommend Emirates.
I am almost in too much pain from having to use the unavailable washroom to write this review. We are currently refuelling in Hamilton because the flight has been overloaded. I am a medium to small size woman and there is inadequate leg and arm room around my seat. They played the same old episode of Big Bang theory on our flight to and from Punta Cana .. come on I will never fly with Sunwing again.
Bridgetown to London Gatwick. Paid for a Business Class flight. The onboard service was abysmal. No refreshments offered on boarding. Dinner took three hours to be served on a night flight. My Husband had to go to the Galley twice for his dinner requests hed been forgotten. I requested Express service which didnt happen. Website advertises Premium Levels of Service and Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable. The service was dreadful but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. Dont waste your money with this airline you dont get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points and telling you that you dont pay for the Service that the extra costs are for taxes the Lounge and extra loyalty points. All BA could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points. Really
On 25th May I flew on SQ736 to Phuket. A young child was running up and down the aisle during turbulence approach and after landing during taxi to gate. The parents absolutely didnt care and the cabin crew didnt either.
Ahmedabad to Dubai. I have a very bitter experience while flying today from Emirates flight. I have been flying with Emirates since past five years but this is happened first time with me. I have already booked online my seat no 22K however while taking boarding pass they changed my seat to 24K. Free breakfast also not provided to me and they did not even have courtesy to ask for meal. While all other passenger got their meal and I feel that I am discriminated from others. Even if you are providing complimentary services either you should have taken proper care for hospitality or better not to provide complimentary and not to advertise it on your itinerary.
George to Johannesburg. This was the most unprofessional staff experience I ever come across in my life. The woman at the ticket office in George does not deserve to have a job. She was rude unprofessional and seemingly untrained for the position she is hired for. To the point where we cancelled our ticket and booked with Kulula air. The flysafair can take about a 100 tips from them.
010 they delay flights like its their job then rush you to board. Worst experience ever. Do not fly Avelo even though the prices are low its not worth the hassle. Never again
Jakarta to Bandar seri Begawan. My first trip with this airline i really enjoyed in cabin even though the flight was delayed 4 hours. Best ground staff and very good for handling a delayed flight. they treated passengers in good service. Cabin crew nice and polite and meals on board fantastic
We were flying from Oslo to Johannesburg via Dubai and return 2 weeks later with Emirates. Fantastic comfortable flights with very good service. Even my wife had no complaints nothing but praise. We especially enjoyed the first leg from Oslo to Dubai with a very pleasant crew. This was partially during daytime. Food and drinks galore. I did not use the WiFi. Will definately fly them again.
Would not recommend flying with Jet2 our experience from getting to the airport was not a good one. Jet2 ground service were insensitive and rude. The aircraft itself was small and uncomfortable not worth the price paid. The Jet2 help desk charged us 35.00 to check in although we had tried to check in the day before but received an error message asking us to try again. I do not find this acceptable at all and will be following up with Jet2 customer service about this matter. The staff were not sympathetic and forced a payment that we could not really afford at this time.
London to Istanbul and return Economy Class. The seats were leather and comfortable staff polite beautiful service. Food was delicious and the Drinks served was nice. I always liked BAs wine selection and they proved it again. There were no individual TVs but they did play a movie on both the flights so that killed time. Boeing 767 flight have enough leg space. A happy on time flight with good service. Always satisfied with BA.
Outbound BAH TO DXB Smooth flight generous amount of food for such a short flight and it was tasty as well Outbound DXB to BHX Disastrous flight was overbooked and cramped making the staff take a long time to board we economy passengers were basically treated like cattle. IFE wasnt responsive and food especially breakfast were bad portions fit for a child and mid flight I realized the meals had given me stomach pains and nausea. Inbound BHX to DXB Extremely bad service 3 hours after take off and nothing not even drinks were given my blood sugar started going down and I got dizzy because of that. When meals were served finally it seemed the attendants forgot to give a lot of people meals including my seat mate. Besides that my meal was terrible barely cooked pasta with a droplet of sauce dead vegetables that was pathetically called a salad and I was given a bread roll with nothing to use it with. Crew barely served any drinks I got massively dehydrated 7hrs flight and in the morning they refused to serve me breakfast because I woke up 2 hours before landing not even a coffee or tea was offered to me. Overall its was a very below average flight and Emirates is overhyped for nothing.
Worst airline ever. Before our flight they said there is technical issues in the airline I have record of that site was showing too. Then an other issue then weather problem finally they called cancelled flight. I got rebooked again through Expedia now I am at New York no one knows where is my checked in luggage.
Madrid to London with British Airways. There is nothing left of business class on these flights. When they bring the hot towel it feels like a bad joke. Seats are the same as coach they took forever to hang my jacket after I asked in three occasions they gave me a sit that is considered a bad coach seat without window See picture and on top of everything I find myself having to put my luggage just a backpack far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesnt fit anymore in coach to business class. Ridiculous service so not worth the x2.5 cost that a business class ticket goes for. Feel totally ripped off.
Cairo to Sharjah was delayed more than an hour. From Sharjah to Dhaka was delayed more than an hour too. No internet no screen in front. There was food services from Cairo to Sharjah but no food from Sharjah to Dhaka almost 5 hours food had to be purchased by cash UAE dirhams. Very rude ground staff in Cairo Sharjah Dhaka. They do not consider that everyone pays for hisher own trip so every passenger is must be valued customer for the airline. I will never travel by this airline next time for sure.
I have now been delayed more than 38 hours for my original flight from Guilin to Chengdu the 8.50am flight on 15th May 2015. There was bad weather at Guilin airport so we there are 2 of us both western were sent to a hotel in Guilin. We waited at the airport until 16.00pm for this service. Shangdong Airlines then failed to tell us that the flight was moved to 02.00am so we stayed in the hotel and missed this flight. Today we finally had our flights changed to CA4324 and we were promised 1st class tickets to Chengdu in way of some small compensation for the extreme delay. This was arranged by a Chinese speaking friend with Shangdong Airlines directly. When we arrived back at the airport we were told that there were no 1st class tickets. So weve been delayed by 38 hours almost 39 now and now weve been lied to about our replacement tickets. This is the worst customer service Ive received and obviously the longest delay Ive experienced.
Chicago to Beijing. The crew were really friendly and provided excellent service. The meals were tasty and seats were comfortable. After a meal a Taiwanese crew helped me a lot when he passed by. When the plane was about to land an old man next to me couldnt find his key or something and the purser who was in charge of the economy class cabin helped him find that. In a word it was an excellent experience.
Amman to Dubai in February 2019. Great airline and a good experience with them the only bad point is the food. The entertainment is superb and the seat is comfortable. there is also blankets as well as charging point.
Dundee to London City with CityJet. Do the extra 50 minute drive to Edinburgh airport half the price 2x plus the service As the other reviewer said security is very thorough but believe me a full body pat down every time you fly especially if thats every week gets just a little bit annoying. More than annoying in fact. CityJet dont even get me started on them 350 per return every time I check in I get told off for something different. Last time I was supposed to print off my boarding card before arriving even though I always check in bags and have no where to print anything at wok. Ryanair customer service at BA prices
I was forced on this flight after American Airways canceled my original one and stuck with them. The flight started as a horror show. 2 and half hours on a plane with little air conditioning while they fixed a technical issue. Communication in English was terrible. Theyd rattle off a couple minutes worth of sentences in Italian and then in English give us a couple wordsusually lies and hope for the best. The food was really gross. All the drinks were extremely scarce. When we landed after a 12 hour flight we were told to wait 5 minutes for the gate to open. It took more like 45 minutes. They had a rule where landing and take off needed all windows open Unfriendly attendants. One especially was blocking an aisle and actually making everything worse when trying to board. Missed my connecting flight because of delays and got stranded because of them.
Travelled to Heathrow to Kalamata and return journey 11 days later. World Traveller aka Economy Class. Both flights departed on time. Return flight landed early BUT we then had a 1 14 hour wait for the baggage to be offloaded which rather ruined the journey home as we then caught a motorway closure. Flights OK FAs particularly on return flight pleasant enough. But as usual Economy class seating was truly dreadful no legroom at all. No better in Club class either only the middle seat left free. Marked down because of this. Can only recommend if you are not tall.
Flown the FrankfurtTHR route. In my experience I have never heard an airline flying to THR cheaper than Iran Air does and the pilots are obviously very skilled. But there are negative sides to flying Iran Air. First of all although their Aibus fleet is one of the safest in the world their other aircrafts Boeing747SP727 and Russian aircraft are one of the oldest and most dangerous so my advice try to avoid these aircraft when flying Iran AIr. Luckily most European flights are with the Airbus fleet. I also know that the poor shape of their Boeing fleet is not caused by neglect but the fact that the Iranian government cant buy spare parts for these aircraft from the US politics and stuff. Also inflght entertainment is almost nonexistent not even in their Business class especially if you dont like Farsi spoken movies shown on a projector so bring a bookmagazinewalkman or whatever. My advice is to fly Iran Aar if you are sure that they are using an Airbus aircraft and if you are more concerned about your budget then about stuff like inflight entertainment or alcoholic drinks.
Mumbai to Amsterdam on 18818 night flight 9W 232. Upgraded from business class to first class due to overbooking. Flat bed in private suite with sliding doors very comfortable I slept almost 6 hours. Amenity kit not available with this airline as Star Alliance and Flying blue gold member I found this quite strange. I ordered cold breakfast and when it arrived jam jar was already open and almost empty not a first class service.
I was nervous after reading the reviews but everything was ok. Plane was new and we arrived on time. Cabin crew were nice but they dont speak much English. Given bread juice and coffee for free. Great comfort for a good price.
My first longhaul with British Airways for 15 years bought because it was a good price for a direct Bangkok London Heathrow and seating 333 not 343 boarding was efficient and departure ontime. Meals were typically British notably using British brands or dishes and acceptable IFE and movingmap were a touch oldfashioned and clunky small screen and limited selection but still just about adequate. Seatfoam was thin and movements of the passenger behind could often be felt which was irritating. Cabincrew on this 12hour full flight were very hardworking. Would use airline again at the right price.
The best airline I have flown with. Everything was as expected for business class. The seats were to die for I actually slept and I never sleep on a plane. The flight crew was excellent and the landing was the best Ive experienced. Definitely recommend flying with them.
The flights from Frankfurt to Auckland via Dubai with Emirates was very comfortable. The seats in the economy class provide lots of space even for taller people like me. There were plenty of beverages to choose and all free. The food was quite tasty and enough to be filled. The most convincing feature at Emirates is the entertainment program on your touchscreen. There is a wide range of movies TV shows and music in different languages. Even the latest movies are available. Although my flight took more than 20 hours it wasnt possible for me to get through the whole offering of entertainment. Nevertheless I got the impression that the cabin crew could be more present from time to time. Waiting time for service was sometimes too long.
Flew on GA863 Sorong to Jakarta. I was assisted upon arrival in Sorong airport by the Garuda support team. The check in process was fast and efficient. I was then escorted through security and to the lounge by ground staff. When it came time for boarding the team helped me through the gate check in process and onto the aircraft. The flight was quite full however the cabin crew managed well. I had ordered a diabetic meal the cabin crew informed me early in the flight that I could have my meal anytime. When it was provided it tasted quite good. The flight time was 3 hours and 39 minutes and we landed in Jakarta on time. Upon arrival I was met by the Garuda ground staff who assisted me in getting my baggage. Overall a good flight and the cabin crew were very helpful and kept coming around and asking if I need any additional snacks and soft drinks.
I booked a flight from Denpasar to Jakarta on 16 April The company changed from JT31 to JT25 no big schedule difference Then they changed from JT25 to JT15 2.5 hours later So I used their involuntary change process to book another flight ID6517 at the same time as my original flight Then they informed me that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hours They never provided any explanation They kicked me off JT25 but this flight was not canceled so I guess they gave my seat to someone else Their help desk never answered. I recommend to avoid this company and sisters companies such as Batik air.
SouthWest has left my wife and I stranded in Seattle on our way to our honeymoon to Bali. Flight changes for our international flight now cost 5K and southwest says they are not responsible for flight delays and inability to get me to my destinations on time I have never had such a negative overall experience during my travels that I had to take a moment just to air out the grievance at 4AM while still traveling. A short hour flight became a 3hour overall flight due to inclement weather and being rerouted to Grand Rapids Michigan. I understand that inclement weather cannot be controlled and safety is priority. One would assume as a purchaser of a connecting flight that when a portion of that flight is off schedule the airline will adjust as needed to still get the customer to their destination in a timely manner. I was not given any reasonable options as I was on my way to catch an international flight to Bali Indonesia and had to be in LAX by 4AM I was given a ticket to get into LAX at 930AM. Adjustments were made to get me flown to Seattle after waiting all night to get my bags in order to recheck them I was treated extremely poorly by the checkin bag personnel who was training another employee. She was very curt abrasive dry and mean. When I brought it to her attention that I had been stuck awake in the airport all night and that I did not appreciate her demeanor she brushed it off and continued in a very aggressive energy to nitpick anything i said or did such as placing both bags on the scale after the first one had been weighed. When I again emphasized the poor fashion in which she was treating me she said she refused to serve me any longer which to my knowledge is only acceptable in scenarios of disrespect and while i felt severely disrespected by her treatment of my person I did not act in any disrespectful fashion toward her. I am distraught as a whole at the incredibly poor showing Southwest is giving me during my travel toward my honeymoon with my wife who lives apart from me due to our work as physicians.
This review is not about the airline aircraft flight crew etc. The flights were excellent. It is about Air Transats affiliation with Europcar car rental company. They caused us problems during our 6 week vacation in Portugal plus they are still almost a month since we returned home charging our credit card with a 600 unauthorized charge. Also we have been trying to recover our security deposit of 300 euros that was promised after the car was returned. They correspond but dont answer questions as to the extra charges on our credit card. I checked the reviews for this company and 89 of the people reviewed gave it the lowest rating possible many with similar complaints regarding questionable probably illegal credit card charge transactions.
Kuwait to Istanbul. The best experience it was in time and the trip progressed smoothly. They have the best leg room the food serivce was abundant. The crew were helpful and accommodating to passenger requests.
Aeroflot refunded fully the ticket costs by clicking only only button. The process was easy and fast. My flight was not cancelled its just due to the new quarantine rules in the country of arrival I had to cancel the ticket. I was surprised and please to see how easy and fast the refund process is. Other airlines offer vouchers or refund only 30 of the ticket price whereas Aeroflot did it on their website and refunded the full fare paid. I am very pleased with the service and would be happy to book again.
Wed booked to fly Club World 4 months ago. Turned up at St Lucia to be told British Airways had overbooked and we had been downgraded this is on a 1700 ticket. According to the duty manager they regularly oversell the premium cabins and staff are fed up with apologising to angry passengers. We were given 300 each travel vouchers as compensation so it means we have to use British Airways again. We ended up in World Traveller plus premium economy. Seats were ok but its the standard Economy menu. Breakfast was a croissant which had come out of a fridge and was disgusting.
Once again flight on time early. Contact centre easy to get hold of and organized a change efficiently. Check in online no hassle staff on plane excellent comps to Robin on this mornings flight she was a great example of working with a smile. The only negative is obviously the increase in flight costs but thats everywhere.
On November 20th 2022 we had requested wheelchair assistance with AirAsia flight from KL to Bangkok BKK on arrival there was no assistance my wife had to climb down stairs. We had notified them that she could not negotiate stairs. I complained but no help whatsoever. So again on January 18th Flight from Bangkok DMK to Penang no wheelchair on arrival after 20 minutes a lift arrived a wheelchair was provided but no assistance I had to push my wife from the aircraft to the exit negotiating 3 steep ramps to get to Airport lounge level trying to carry 2 cabin bags also. When I complained that I am 78 years of age this is ridiculous Air Asia ground staff lady said You look fit enough Thank you for that. Air Asia have refunded the 300 baht that I had paid for the wheelchair but to my Air Asia account they say that I cannot get this returned to my bank account. I have to use it with them we do not intend to fly Air Asia again. Return flight on January 24th same problem IN DMK no wheelchair on arrival my wife was asked if she could walk she cannot because of the pain in her knee. Eventually a wheelchair arrived. Terrible service by AirAsia.
Manila to Auckland via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Ground staff and cabin crew were polite and well fed throughout the flight. In flight entertainment selection was good and lavatories are clean and stocked. Wish that baggage allowance is generous like of Qantas or PAL Economy 30 kg.
I flew from Newcastle on 110917 to Hurghada. Thomas Cook decided not to load 127 bags so the plane which was late could get into the air quicker no one knew until about 40 minutes before landing the pilot announced a load of rubbish about their supposed to follow on a following flight there isnt one.Thomas Cook will say anything to keep people quiet and claim they are giving out information if its factually inaccurate. So you fill out a form with all your details on Thomas Cook will do nothing with this they claimed our luggage would be couriered first thing the next day this was a lie they were on a late flight from Gatwick. Thomas Cook absolutely refused to give any local rep details. I spent the first day of my holiday in the hotel lobby trying to find out any information my 1st days diving cancelled so after several web chats with people either unwilling of unable to absolutely anything like tell me where my stuff is and a couple of FB messenger chats I finally call it quits at 0130 still no luggage. Wednesday 3 days in I go off diving returning to my hotel at about 8pm still no luggage nothing from Thomas Cook no email no phone calls no response. I happen to find out totally by chance I would have to take a taxi to Hurghada airport myself with boarding cards passport and luggage tags if I didnt have any of these no bags. In a nut shell Thomas Cook will take your money to take you on holiday not bother loading all your holiday stuff to save a bit of time you are an afterthought they will not support you in the slightest give you the required information to solve a problem nothing you are on your own.
This airline had apparently been suspended from service about a month ago September 2022 I was told on the airport in Nairobi as well as in Lamu. They havent informed passengers they even still let you buy tickets and do check in online and when you show up at the airport its only then when you realize that there is no flight of fly540. Please do not book with this airline.
They weighed my backpack which never happens usually and they made me pay for the extras and thats more than the ticket itself I had to empty everything and put in the big luggage and when I came back they didnt even measure the backpack and they charged me for the extra kilos in the big luggage So cheap will never fly with them again.
New York to Cairo via Dubai. Flew business class on A380 to Dubai then economy to Cairo on 777. service was excellent. Food high quality and plentiful. In flight entertainment had a variety of options though I couldnt use for first 45 minutes of first flight due to a technical issue. Would fly again. Wifi was very slow throughout the flight compared to other airlines.
I was impressed by the airlines efficiency starting from Houston IAH airport at checkin and further on the airport. They opened the checkin about 4 hours before the flight and in about 20 minutes since arriving at the airport I was up in the lounge having checked in passed immigration and security checks. The flight attendants did a very good job during the flights on both legs it seems they take their job very seriously. Checking the passengers baggage compartments emergency exits was done several time by the flight attendants as a matter of safety more times than Ive seen with other airlines. During the flight they wandered around serving refreshment drinks and sandwiches and since I had trouble sleeping Ive seen them a lot. The seats were comfortable in economy on both flights and I was actually expecting worse conditions after reading some reviews before the flight. The seats were indeed suitable especially since Im a bit overweight. There was wifi on board both flights however I did not use it. The entertainment system did not have as many choices as on other airlines but the fact that I did not see any advertising made everything a pleasant experience. The airport in Taipei was a bit crowded but the lounge was nice clean properly supplied and overall the experience was very good.
This is not my first review on Tunis Air but since the closure of the LondonTunis flight on BA this is the only scheduled direct service from the UK right now. Departed on the TU790 on the 06th April. The flight was over 2 hours late arriving into London on the inbound so did not depart until some time after the STD. Outbound aircraft TSIMH was very old 1994 and extremely dirty inside. The cabin crew were not very happy and showed this in the service or lack of during the flight. Meals were simply a piece of bread with cheese and chicken and 1 service of drinks. The most memorable part of the flight was going to the rear cabin once the food and drinks service was concluded. The cabin crew 6 members were having a wonderful time socialising with no regard or interest in the passengers. The return flight that I took on the 13th April as the return leg TU791 was operated by a much newer 2013 aeroplane TSIMV. However again clearly Tunis Air have either a very poor outsourced company which do the aircraft cleaning in Tunis Airport or they simply do not clean their planes in order to save costs At least 1 cabin crew member was on board who operated the flight a week earlier. Unfortunately again the service was a complete repeat of the earlier flight. Tunis Air are under increasing pressure I am informed to perform as an airline who frankly have not for some time. However if this is an indication of the measures they are taking to improve the service then I do not hold much hope for the airline going forward and once EZY start their service from STNMIR in June I will be switching my business to them.
First Flight Y9536 Calgary to Kelowna Delayed 2 hours without announcement in Calgary. Flight came from Toronto and is always delayed. No gate announcement until 15 min. Before boarding. Second flight Y9537 Kelowna to Calgary. Delayed by one day then cancelled. 6 hours later flight pushed out for another 2 full days. No notification SMS or Email received. Claimed for refund since I had to book another flight back to Calgary. System created a case File for APPR. But no response from the Airline. Unprofessional. File a complaint at Air Travel complaint.
Tokyo to Madrid via Paris. Bad experience with Air France they lost my baggage in the two ways of the travel. Experience in flight was normal like other company the ground services was an absolute disaster.
Osaka to Busan. Great value budget airline. Web site and onboard magazine promise free water but none was offered. Checkin at KIX was about 20 minutes checkin at PUS was zero with no other customers in sight. Offered decent seats even though we hadnt prebooked them. Outward flight was delayed due to air traffic control restrictions at KIX but landed on time due to timetable padding. Return flight left early but landed slightly late after circling around western Japan for ages. Boarding on both flights smooth. Bus to terminal at PUS but sky bridge on return flight. Perfectly adequate and reasonably efficient for a budget airline and a onehour flight. Would use again.
This is by far the worst flying experience Ive ever had the displeasure of experiencing. The staff were unhelpful rude and just gave wrong directions our gate changed a total of five times and looping back to our original gate it took two hours to even get a crew on board the plane and when we were finally seated and ready to go they had to refuel the plane Our flight was supposed to leave at 4 pm but it left at 920pm. I never wish to fly with this horrible airline for as long as I live. Awful experience.
I flew GCILGWGCI in November. 5 minutes early on departure. Arrival into LGW early. Even the bags arrived quickly. Cabin crew under pressure to serve the free drinks but got there. On return the only slight delay was the need for the long taxi down to the end of the runway at Gatwick. On time arrival. On E195 super plane 31m flight. Bag delivery in GCI could be improved though very slow. I have travelled 30 times on Aurigny this year. Never let me down they always get me home.
Funchal to Lanzarote via Las Palmas and back. The flights were on time crew smiling and served a snack between Funchal and Las Palmas which for a flight of about 1 hr 30 mins was a treat. Gran Canaria airport is busy all the time but actually it is very easy and simple to use.
LHRSOFLHR seat 1A on an upgraded A320 in both directions check in at T5 quick and the galleries lounge was fine as always. Departed on time a breakfast served by a pretty nice crew not that much room really for business class appears to be getting less. Return check in quick although security at Sofia very slow and the lounge is not worth using flight delayed around an hour due to weather but once away a decent meal served by yet another nice crew landed around 30 min late on a remote stand but bags on the belt by the time I reached it.
Prague to Ostrava 60 minutes is sometimes merged with Prague to Kosice 90 minutes into a single flight Prague to Kosice with a stopover in Ostrava which adds some 30 to 40 minutes to total flight time for passengers to Kosice. On January 12 however CSATravel Service came up with something new Prague to Ostrava via Kosice. The normally 60minute flight to Ostrava thus took 3 hours and 30 minutes Passengers to Ostrava were taken all the way to Kosice made to leave the aircraft there then to board again 20 minutes later and only brought to their destination on the way back to Prague. Huge savings for the carrier zero respect to cargo. Sorry I mean to passengers mainly homeward business travelers on a Friday afternoon. I am appalled at the level of arrogance displayed by the once respectable national carrier. If informed in time I could have opted for a train ride which would have brought me home earlier and at a fraction of the cost while pampering me with all the comforts of a modern speed train like WiFi royal amounts of legroom nice onboard service and a well stocked dining car. Instead I was confronted by the grim reality only at the gate minutes before boarding. No options no choice no apology no compensation. Just a matteroffactly answer to my astonished question Yes you will fly via Kosice. And one more thing the food included in my fare was not served which is why I checked NA below.
The best experience ever on board for me. The crew is very professional and helpful. Aircraft was so clean and the food is super delicious and tasty. Such a wonderful experience.
I was travelling to Tokyo Narita via Dubai. In 2022 I had the meal issues on return journey from NRT To DXB when they could only offer a meal with items I have bad allergies to Then second meal Cabin Crew forgot to offer wouldnt give any water on 12.5 hour flight. for the recent one I contacted Emirates Customer Service that I have allergies for fish mushroom and wholemeal Customer service rep said bring your own food then and the crew will heat them up I said it will be taken off me at security at Glasgow if not Dubai he said no the day came food was taken off me at Security at Glasgow. As backup they booked me a bland meal that wouldnt contain my allergies on DXB to NRT section GLADXB meals were fine which was Mushroom and second meal fish and mushroom. Which meant no food just a tiny bottle of water. Im already worried about the return flights and worries were confirmed when once again meals offered with allergy items Cabin crew Ill give credit concerned very little food and water. Not just that my seat was broke headphones broke and the so called ICE entertainment system wouldnt work 12 hours nothing to do and crew couldnt move as they already moved others with similar problem couldnt move myself. I recently got a response from Customer Service out of their control and one the flight cabin also said they would have refused the my own food and I wouldnt have gotten anything through Dubai for second flight. 2024 and 2025 holidays wont be with Emirates. Emirates are one of the worst customer service experiences.
Very rude call centre people once they take your money from card you are abandoned as no help you get from them. Flights have been cancelled no email notification no live information no refund after 3 months This is the last time I am using them.
I booked a connecting flight from Manila to Tacloban few weeks ago then Airasia cancelled and rebook my flight 1hr after my arrival from international flight. Then when I tried to re book the customer service is doesnt want to entertain my issue. I had no choice but to rebook it the next flight. I have waited 9 hrs at Manila then 2 hrs before the scheduled departure they announce again there will be delay of flight.
ORYPTP return in Business Class. On the outward flight from Paris we were first told we would have to fly via Fort de France eventually they got us a seat on the initial flight. It was a leased aircraft of Hi Fly. The cabin was filthy plastic spoons on the floor the seat with bread crumbs dust and grease everywhere. The seat was at most an Economy seat. The entertainment was of no use an economy tray with inedible food. No curtains to separate cabins and galley. Not to speak of the condition of the toilet. I feel it is not correct to not provide excuse and compensation to passengers if the delivered product differs so much from the purchased one.
Boarding was on time cabin crew were very friendly flight was late for like 10 mins and the whole crew and pilots were very apologetic. Plane was spotless. Drinks tea coffee and cake was served on 1 hours long flight. For 36 Euro promo fare very impressive flight.
Doha to Kolkata via Mumbai. Air India wasnt my first choice of airline. Usually when looking for airlines to fly Im searching up and down the list of consumeraviation from Qatar. This trip was mostly like a horror movie. The start flight was precisely 1 hour late on 11th Jan 19 AI9002. Was quite patient with the waiting time. Then it all started. Heres the list of flaws Poor hygiene in the washroom. No head napkinhygiene cloth on top of the seat absolutely unacceptable. Dinner a nightmare and I must elaborate with complete respect by saying management is least bothered with regards to the quality of food no expiry date label on the food how could you do that. Its simply criminal. Asked the staff and all that they have to say is Its our standard. I replied Its my right to know the manufacturing date and the date of expiration. Eyebrows up and rolling eyes is all I got. Staff looked helpless as they had no answer and hid themselves behind the curtain and never came out to clarify further. Its my right to have a great experience leave beside the money paid for the ticket. I do not expect a Qatar Airways service but at least please try and get close to them to make all happy who chooses you. Take customers seriously please. On the contrary the flight from Mumbai to Kolkata was excellent. Professional staff. Good breakfast again label missing. Honestly this flight made some good service recovery.
Venice to Melbourne via Dubai. I am now on my way back to Australia and yet again experiencing the worst customer service ever from Emirates. Just before my departure I had received an offer to upgrade from economy to business for part of my return trip from Dubai to Melbourne for AU 1157 . As my leg had not yet healed did my way into Europe on a wheelchair and although feeling much better I thought I could do this effort and upgrade so that I could be more comfortable. Before my departure I tried several times to do the online upgrade but unsuccessfully as every time i filled everything and clicked upgrade a message came out that the system was down Note that my card was more than capable of covering the cost hence it was not a payment issue Tried again before I had to catch my first flight but then I had to board and had to let go. Arrived in Dubai I went to the service desk where there was only single person available to do the ticketing service and was stuck serving a person for over 20 minutes I had another person before me and I knew I would never had time to wait so I went to another side of the service desk to ask for assistance. The lady said no one else could assist and also that she knew for sure I could not upgrade with that offer anymore as I had already started the first leg. When I explained that I did try many times to do the upgrade online before my flight but the Emirates website did not work and a message came out that the system was down so it was not my fault they just said they could not do anything and if I wanted to upgrade the price would not have been the same On the plane I asked again. They had quite a few empty seats in business but they asked almost 4 times as much as the offer I had in my email asked around 3.500 US dollars for one leg upgrade on the plane While my offer was 1157 Australian dollars for the same which equals to us 864 I am so angry and disappointed but if you want to see this from a marketing point of view Emirates has lost both in image and in money. In fact those seats have remained empty and Emirates has now another very upset and angry customer who has been loyal for years. Emirates has gone so downhill lately which is unbelievable.
Took SilkAik flight on 21 Augustfrom Siem Reap back to Singapore. The crew were not friendly and not attentive to passenger. Their attitude was rude especially when clearing the trays from us without even asking. No smiling faces at all.
Was actually two way trip from LAX to LIN and viceversa. Change at CDG got delayed over 3 hours. Return they cancel me from the flight for no reason Upgrade to Business up to CDG and Premium Economy to LAX from CDG lost my luggage. WIFI not working for 80 of the flight.
Jakarta to Denpasar BaliS on 06 January 2021 as part of Family trip to SE Asia. Bali requires a valid PCR Test to enter and we were told to validate our papers at a validation desk at the airport before we can even checkin. Check in was done really quick. We waited at a gate area where there were 3 other airplanes were parked so it was quite crowded and only after other flights took off we were able to get some seats close to the gate. The boarding was done old style Business class first then Economy all at the same time. However they did not announce to prepare the PCR Test to show at the gate so after we showed them our passports I have to fish for the PCR Test papers from my rolling bag for the gate agent when we were already at the gate and she asked for it. Or perhaps she just did it randomly because were not locals I dont know. The airplane is a 9 year old B738 PKGFS that is still in good condition and clean however we still sanitize the tray table seatbelts screen and armrest with Clorox wipes. The seats are large with ample legroom and the touch screen even though smaller but still very bright and watchable. They do not have a large selection of movies and music available but more than enough for this short 1.5 hours flight. They still use the twoprong jack so we cannot use our wireless transmitter 3.5 jack and bluetooth headphones but have to use the provided free headphones. The FAs were very courteous and polite they are super friendly and helpful and also cheerful in their disposition when interacting with passengers. No wonder GA FAs won awards years in a row for being the best FA in the world Even for this short flight we got a snack box with savory pastry cake and a granola bar and a bottle of water. The FAs also offer drink service along with the snack box. They apologized that due to Covid19 they can no longer offer hot meal but only snack box in this short flight. Very good engagement again makes me realize why they were the best FAs We left 27 minutes behind schedule due to some late passengers but were able to arrive 1226 PM local time 14 minutes early from our scheduled arrival. Even in this short flight the service is great and the spacious seats and even though rather limited entertainment makes flying Garuda Indonesia a great experience. Other airlines especially in US should learn a lot from Garuda on how to make a flight that is enjoyed and not dreaded by their passengers.
I booked a flight from Papeete to Paris via San Francisco on Edreams. They proceeded to the reservation on French Bee. When I arrived at Papeete airport I was asked to collect my luggage in San Francisco. This was something I could not do as there was only two hours of transit time. I tried everything I stressed all the people in the customs line to try to arrive on time finally I missed the flight to Paris. In San Francisco put me back on the next flight to Paris 2 days later. I asked them to book me a hotel which was refused because for them it was a mistake at Edreams. They left me without a solution. I had some money and I was able to book a hotel end of holidayslimited budget. When I came back I tried everything to recover the hotel and restaurant expenses.
First time flight on Virgin America from Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles. Buckled up waiting on tarmac and the pilot announces there is not enough fuel to reach our nonstop destination Los Angeles due to the expectation of strong headwinds he states we will probably have to stop in Las Vegas for refueling. I never heard this type of announcement before and it was kind of creepy. If amount of fuel was a concern why couldnt that have been addressed while at Fort Lauderdale prior to takeoff. Though I am an Alaska Airlines fan and knowing that they just purchased Virgin America not sure if I will fly Virgin America again. It ended up we were able to bypass Las Vegas with pilot announcing our fuel safety margin was OK and we went on to LAX. Still I think that creepy announcement gave me a bit of angst during the flight that I could have done without
Flew QantasLink from Gladstone to Brisbane. Food was great Australian owned and made selections staff incredibly helpful. Phoned ahead to help me make my connecting flight and got a private car on the runway waiting for me as I arrived. Unbelievable service delays due to weather put my connecting flight in trouble I booked this myself and it was my own fault for cutting it close. Qantas went out of their way to help me.
Flew back from Malta after scattering our sons ashes at his favourite spots. When we boarded the aircraft for our return flight my wife became upset. A member of the cabin crew noticed this and immediately spoke to my wife and tried to reassure her. Her name is Tracey an exceptional crew member. I noticed she spoke to other travellers in a courteous manner and was friendly. Each time she passed my wife she asked how she was and would she like anything. This kindness made a difficult time easier for us both. Aircraft seats were comfortable and service good for a 2hrs. 45mins. flight. Thank you B.A.
Gatwick to Holguin. A technical fault delayed us for 5 hours and we were put up in a hotel. We had a 7.30 am call to be told we are going back to the airport but we were without food and drink vouchers. Finally at 6pm we get told to go back to the airport. We checkin for the second time wait and sit on the plane and wait. No communication from Cubana staff for over an hour we are all getting more and more upset and frustrated. We had to get off the plane and told we couldnt get our luggage as Servisair had all gone home. We had to go through passport control again and by this time all passengers were upset and really angry. Cubana left it up to Gatwick staff to look after us and gave us blankets and mats to sleep on the floor which is a joke We cancelled our holiday with Cubana and booked it with a reputable airline.
Flew British Airways from Lisbon to London Heathrow. Uneventful flight. The crew were very pleasant when welcoming the passengers but then seemed like they were doing everyone a favor by being there. They should smile and be a little more considerate. However the checkin lady was nice and we had a laugh. My problem with BA for a while now is that it has become a low cost airline for shorter flights.
During our two week stay in Vietnam we booked three flights weeks in advance. All flights were adjusted and changed within 48 hours of departure one we werent even told about until we arrived for check in. Our final flight which was scheduled to get a connecting flight back to Australia was changed with less than 24 hours notice and put us at risk of being unable to get home. Customer service was impossible to reach on the phone and took hours to respond to multiple emails and Facebook messages ruining the last day of our trip. When we went to check in on this final flight we were told by the staff that we were not in their system even though we had an email confirmation had chosen seats and had ticket numbers allocated to us in the app. I had to literally cry and beg so that the staff would acknowledge their mistake so that they would issue us with tickets for the flight we needed to be on to get home. Ive been given no actual apology or compensation for the immense amount of stress theyve caused over the last 2 weeks just autogenerated responses from the customer service team.
Beijing to London. After I got off the plane I found no baggage I found that there was no result for about two hours and there was a suitcase that was exactly the same as my suitcase. Brand model color are the same has been unclaimed. After the airport staff said that let me contact Air China Air China has passenger contact information and gave a baggage agency company list file number and said it would help find after the exit my son to China Air China The phone was transferred to the baggage office and then my son suggested that the airline contact the owner of the unclaimed box. Then the customer service said Sorry our airline does not have the customers contact information but we recorded the file. And said it twice. My son contacted GBS baggage agency at 730 pm London time on the 29th. During the exchange the staff called this passenger took the wrong baggage but the baggage was not found. After that I called again at 11.59 in the evening. The customer service still said that if there was any problem please contact the London airport after my repeated questioning the customer service changed the name and said Contact China Air Chinas partner company at the London airport Thirdparty outsourcing companies are completely unable to provide effective and reasonable solutions. When it comes to allowing Air Chinas partner companies in London to reply to the process of this incident every day the customer service said that no permission no idea only message in my After mentioning the compensation the customer service said that the baggage will be searched for within 21 days. If the baggage is not found after 21 days the baggage tag will be lost and the airport will be compensated. But as far as I know it is only passive waiting to find the baggage. The person who got the wrong baggage contacted the airport but until now Air China did not receive the wrong number of luggage.
Hong Kong to Xian via Xiamen. I had to book Xiamen Airlines because I would have to have an extra day in Hong Kong so decided to stay in Xiamen over night. The flight was first delayed 1 hour then 2 and the 355 thats almost 4 hours and another airlines flight to Xiamen went through so it was not the weather that caused the delay by the time the third delay appeared on the board it was too late to cancel my hotel booking and get a refund once I got out at Xiamen airport I had only two hours between my flight and next flight checkin I first asked for a compensation they said sorry then later I asked for a hotel refund since clearly this was their mess up that led me to the mess up also denied then was told that the airport free hotel had no place and the lounges wouldnt open for another two hours will have to take my next flight soon and will have to have a sit down with a manager of some sort of this is how they run their business I would stay clear of Xiamen Airlines and be careful considering to booking a ticket with them especially involving a non direct location.
This is not the first time I flew Air Serbia but it was the first flying business class. One thing that none of the people complaining about broken wheels I had those broken by Lufthansa and never saw a refund either are saying is that Air Serbia seems to be one of the very few airlines in the world respecting the safety distancing rules that airlines are supposed to obey but do not All the middle seats on our flight both in the Economy and Business class were blocked. After flying Air Serbia in December I had to fly Turkish AeroMexico Avianca and Viva Colombia and none of them had this policy we flew as packed as ever. So hat down to Air Serbia for going this extra mile and flying half empty planes in order to make passengers safer during the pandemic. Every other aspect of our trip was just fine there was a wonderful lounge with free food in Belgrade which we used before the flight the big meal on the flight we flew safely and comfortably the crew was very kind and polite our luggage made it and the touchdown at Istanbul was like landing on cotton. I could not wish anything more from an airline. Thank you and keep up the good work.
Never fly with this airline. They overbooked our flight from San Juan to Vieques a small plane that could hold no more than 10 passengers. We were supposed to fly via Silver on our connecting flight from San Juan to Vieques on our honeymoon but they booted us from the flight because of apparent overbooking. They gave us a voucher to stay at a hotel in San Juan over night but the hotel proceeded to charge our credit card anyway. These rats are only out to scam people and steal your money. If you can fly with Cape Air instead if traveling to Vieques they are much more reliable and professional.
United is the worst airline I have ever experienced. They do things like delay your flight every 30 minutes for 5 hours then abruptly cancel because the pilot tapped out at midnight. Absolutely unacceptable and I will never fly United again. I also feel obligated to warn everyone else never to fly united either. Terrible airline.
On time departure from IAD and smooth connection in IST for onward flight to VIE. FAs need to improve their English which is surprisingly poor given the airlines global reach. Almost without fail each time I asked for a drink full of ice and motioned with my hands to show a glass brimming with ice I got a drink without any ice at all. Other interactions with crew were found to be lacking given low English proficiency. The cockpit announcement on the ISTVIE sector was almost completely unintelligible. Food was fairly good but no better than QR or a number of other carriers. On the return ISTIAD a very rude passenger in 3E I was in 4K began berating me when I dared to use the overhead bin above his seat which was directly across from my seat. All other bins were full with either bedding for the sleep service or other paxs luggage. He shouted at me Why are you using my bin to which I replied it isnt your bin it is for business class passengers. He continued to berate me. I told him to be quiet and reported it to the chief purser who did nothing.
I was flying from Beijing to Pyongyang with a Tupolev 204300. The aircraft was in an excellent state and the service was very friendly. The flight departed and arrived in time.
Last Saturday I flew Milan LinateOlbia Costa Smeralda. Originally booked the early morning flight but was rescheduled on the next flight. No explanation or other option given. Meridiana still operates the old MD80 my plane was at least 20 years old and did show its age no in flight entertainment at all even the in flight magazine was missing. Seats are quite comfortable though. Cabin crew looked lazy coffee tea water and juices free of charge. Prices are way too high but on this route they are the only ones flying. Talks by itself. If you can avoid it.
Flew Kigali to Monrovia over Nairobi and Accra on 89 May 2022. Flights on time. Checked in online worked well and got my BPs in airport swiftly. No luggage issues. Recognised as Skyteam elite. Kenya Airways staff came to me in lounge and without request carried my handluggage for me from lounge to the aircraft. No waiting time nor queues anywhere on the trip despite the flights were full or almost full. KQ delivers and have rarely let me down over the years. Pearl Lounge in Kigali delivers but suffers from deprived views of airport runways. First flight was on an Embraer 190 which is a lovely roomy aircraft. Onboard they allowed me to shift to an exit row as my original seat was mistakenly occupied by another person. The seat now offered was very nice it would have cost me 50 USD if booked online. Drinks were generously provided. Appreciate Kenya Airways often have the Happy Hour concept where a request for a single drink most often triggers serving two. The wine in minibottles was acceptable a South African Stonedale. I had requested seafood meal and I got it it was a cold tasty salmon sandwich. FAs were kind and effective. No IFE nor WiFi but on a 90 minutes flight its not an issue. Transit in Nairobi Airport smooth and quick. It took me only 15 Minutes to reach the KQ Pride Lounge. I love this lounge roomy and curvy designs with lots of nice sections. Had a god nights sleep after acquainting myself with a Niederburg rosewine which superseded an alternative Italian sparkling wine The next flights from Nairobi to Monrovia via Accra were on their B737800. Despite the flight was completely full all seats taken in both classes the staff manage to care passengers well. No power outlet nor monitors only WiFi and use of personal devices were possible. Special meal rendered to perfection. I also tried other dishes as I was offered. Drinks provided generously again Happy Hour order 1 get 2 occurred at least once. Slight delay as the stopover in Accra took longer time as a lot of passengers disembarked before cleaning and loads of new passengers came on board again the flight was full. Luggage in Monrovia came out quickly. Nicely done Kenya Airways. Can recommend.
Ho Chi Minh to Bangkok. Top service from beginning to end. Aircraft was clean and spacious and the cabin crew was very friendly. No wait times on either end and our luggage was returned ASAP.
Brisbane to Sydney. Travelled with a 6 month old baby and this was the worst service ever experienced. Some of the young ladies employed at Brisbane airport service desk demonstrated zero customer service on our trip to Sydney. They were sarcastic extremely rude and showed no understanding of what was helpful to a travelling family. Ive done 8 flights with my daughter on other airlines and this short flight with Tigerair was by far the worst and left me in tears. We also had white stains on the seats in the plane overall a nightmare experience. Tiger need to train their Brisbane front of house staff in customer service.
Flight was delayed due to weather issues and was rebooked for the next day delayed again and finally flew later that day. Comfortable flight eventually and the domestic lounge in Sydney was excellent too. Followed up on missed flight related issues and was handled promptly and very professionally by Roshelyn Christine the guest relations people. Thank you.
Just as most of the other reviewers stated Bahamasair is just so lacking in professionalism. But there is not much competition so they continue to perform without caring. We sat in Marsh Harbor this past Sunday for seven hours waiting for our flight to West Palm Beach to show up. No explanation and no help from the airline employees. To be fair they did give us an 8 voucher to be used at the airport cafe. Of course we missed our flight out of West Palm to Boston no help given to us for the inconvenience. Just so frustrating especially when checking in to the Holiday Inn West Palm to find other airlines distressed passengers with credit vouchers to be used for foodhotelexpenses. Also our flight to Marsh Harbor was delayed but only by one hour which I think is great for Bahamasair hardly worth mentioning. We love the Bahamas but will have to avoid them in the future if Bahamasair is the only option.
Departure was about 40 minutes late. The A350 we flew on was about eighteen months old. The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back it is a real challenge to get out of the seat. The screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen. Audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation I gave up trying to watch. The cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service it felt very disorganised. Felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft felt unnatural. The overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight. I tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wifes meal but no one responds better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle. Nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours. I am going to explore other options before using BA again the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport.
Tokyo to Tashkent via Seoul. Booked ticked for family. Since we had newly born child I called Asiana Airlines to add him. Eventually they did not we found it out during check in time. Called to check opening time for luggage check in. Was told different time than the actual. It took 1 hour to check in our suitcases by using individual mileages. During passport check Asiana Airlines did not delay the flight 1015 minutes. Staff was very cold did not show any empathy to help and communicate what I am requesting to her pilot Had to pay extra 500 to change the tickets. Could not use Family Mileage. Could not get reasonable explanation from staff. Worst experience ever.
Auckland to Papeete. A new Boeing 7879 good spacious seats on Business class. We had a bulk seat 1A. Even though close to the galley I did not hear any rattling. Entertainment is very poor. This review is about the cabin crew on board service. It is appalling. They do the minimum at the cabin. No helping to set up your tray for dinner. No food order taken. They look fed up. I experienced their service to be rude distant unenthusiastic and Unfriendly. If you ever go to PPT fly with air New Zealand.
Overall a decent experience with Air France travelling back home from Paris to Bogota. Flying on an A340 the economy class seats were very uncomfortable and the tv screens were outdated compared to other airlines but aside from that I had an enjoyable flight. The food we received was delicious and there was enough in flight entertainment to get me trough the 11 hour flight.
No frills quick easy safely and clean flights from Dagestan to Moscow. The airplane was clean the staff in nice uniforms professional. They packed us quickly flew us safely the baggage was out sooner than I made it to the carousel. Only a glass of water for the whole flight but it is only 2 hours. Nothing to complain about would fly again and recommend.
Spoke with an agent to see if I could get a voucher to fly at a later date as my husband has Covid. Unable to get a voucher as agent stated Sun Country no longer has Covid Rules in place all customers can fly Sun Country airlines even if you have Covid. So no voucher but more concerned that the information is not accurate. I only had a one way to MN with Sun Country my returning flight was with Frontier and I was given vouchers immediately 3 of us flying and all given vouchers. I fly to MN many times during the year as does my family flying from MN to Denver. We will never fly Sun Country Airlines. Thanks to Frontier for working with us and slowing us to fly at a later date.
Shanghai PVG to Chengdu in economy. Check in through MUstaff usually grumpy but got requested emergency exit. As usual gate was changed and flight delayed by the usual 45 min. Clean A320. I am 6ft 6 and had way enough legroom Emergency exit proved to be only 2nd row behind the exit door seats but legroom still ok. Shortly before take off was asked if I speak Chinese. As I denied I was quite straight told I should move this is a Chinese flight I should move 1 row behind. Ok no problem The emergency exit seats were then occupied by 2 elderly Chinese ladies of which I doubt there were strong enough to open the door not to say help other passengers. After boarding plane sat another 20 min or so on the parking position. FAs went round to distribute Chinese Newspapers a single FA came running with an English copy of China Daily for me. After take off plenty of drink runs however no beer and food was absent did not manage to find the reason. Were handed small bags with dried beef and dates but I was really hungry. After landing plane was parked on the tarmac had to take a 10min busride to the terminal. Overall pleasant and nice I am amazed to find this level of service and friendliness at a Chinese airline. Will fly them again and can refer them without hesitation to be one of the best Chinese airlines.
ALGAAE. The flight to Annaba took 1hr and was uneventful. Air Algerie will always serve you a drink and a close an eye to your baggage allowance which is good. But service is nondescript and like many airlines of North Africa when there is a problem there is nobody to speak to and nobody is responsible for anything. So when flying them have lots of time on your hand patience and a good book. Their prices are usually good especially for domestic flights. Would fly them again but as I said it is nothing memorable.
I booked a flight on August 2nd for 4 members Myself wife 2 kids. I was very happy to see a fight which was departing early from Bangalore to Jaipur. However 3 days before travel the flight was rescheduled at 1130 AM. After a day It was rescheduled for 1100 AM. Actually I booked this flight so that I could reach Jaipur early and then drive from Jaipur to Hanumangarh. One day before the travel it was rescheduled at 330 PM. In the airport Flight was again delayed and left around 4 20 PM. Because of this inconvenience we had to stay in Jaipur and leave next day morning. I had specially spoken to Customer care regarding travelling with 2 small kids and they agreed to put our cabin baggage to checkin baggage as one luggage by hearing about our travel. However on the airport counter the lady said i cannot do so and need to speak with customer care. Sir if you have issue you need to submit a complaint. From my side I was totally helpless by hearing from their side. Frankly they need to have a uniformity regarding their rules and regulation. If they agreed anything through customer support they need to update that on my booking. Anyways after a long struggle and repeated requests they agreed. Personally This was my first and last time I travelled on GoAir.
After we had checked in given up our bag and gone through security we received a text from Jetstar Flight cancelled due to engineering reasons. Better safe than sorry I get it. But it was the Easter long weekend there were no other flights available until the next day. It took us an hour to get our bag back and we lost a day of our Easter break. On the following day the automatic checkin was quick and easy. Service from the ground and cabin staff was good. The plane operated 40 mins late. It would have been sensible to leave passengers in the public area of the main terminal for that time so they could get food and go to the toilet. But Jetstar called us all down to the already crowded departure area to spend the time milling about and trying to work out if there was a queue. Seats were comfortable if basic. The airlines takeon bag policy was not enforced the cabin crew were imploring passengers who had done the right thing to put their bags under the seat in front of them in order to make room in the overhead racks for the suitcasesize bags that the airline had allowed on board.
Manchester to Kos. Please dont book the airport lounges if flying with Thomas Cook from Manchester. You pay for 3hours in lounge but Thomas Cook wont let you check in until exactly 3hours before takeoff even though youve already checked in online. After this you still need to go through security and all the delays this brings you also have to be at the gate 30 Mina before takeoff reducing time spent in lounge considerably. Thomas Cook staff were very rude at info desk when trying to make this point and saying airport lounges were nothing to do with them even though they bombard you with offers to book them by email pre holiday. Wont be booking lounges again.
Peruvian Airlines Boeing 737 from Lima to Cusco on an aged plane but clean. We had an hour delay but was not airlines fault. They had us for 35 minutes waiting with doors closed but the LIM control tower was not giving the go ahead. 3 flights from LIM that we had and all of them were delayed very unorganized airport. The airline was OK they served sandwiches and drinks on an 1 hour and 15 minutes flight. Ticket value is great because they do not charge the tax of 85 each way that other airlines charge. Reading the reviews I was afraid but our experience was OK.
Flew Istanbul to Hurghada. Convenient airside access through the lounge appreciated. The lounge offering good range of food and beverage options late into the night. Could do with some variations though. Orderly boarding process with preflight announcements and priority enforcement. Was upgraded due to overbooking which was a nice surprise. Full cabin. The crew were excellent. Pre take off drinks a nice breakfast with two warm choices and after meal drinks service provided. Handed out tablets with preloaded entertainment and good quality headphones for this 2.5 hour hop on this A321 with empty middle seat configured J Cabin. Very smooth landing despite rough weather and on time arrival. Kudos to the flightdeck. Excellent overall flying experience with Turkish Airlines on this journey.
I paid almost 300 to fly from London to Frankfurt. The flight took off and then was rerouted back to London because of weather and German air space closing. The communication to passengers was horrible and it took two hours waiting in line to get a hotel room only to learn they still hadnt rebooked my flight. While waiting in line I tried multiple times to call their customer service number and was on hold for twenty minutes at a time before hanging up due to international cell phone costs. The rebooked flight landed 22 hours after my original flight was supposed to land and even that flight was delayed because of broken air conditioning. Which was identified after we already boarded and were sitting on the tarmac during a rare London heatwave. I landed almost a day later than planned but my bag didnt make it from London for another four days. British Airways provided no guidance for which baggage and delay related expenses theyd reimburse yet then denied portions of my claim. The delays lost baggage and frustrating experience dealing with them really ruined the first part of my holiday. I complained to their customer service team and after a lot of back and forth they offered a 20 pound travel voucher. Such a horrible experience with this airline will never fly them again
I hate British Airways We get to London on Oct 3 and our next flight is cancelled. We stand in line with 1200 other people to get it fixed and they tell everyone to leave the airport and call them to fix. They book us the next day..via online. Dont offer vouchers for hotel we will miss our tour. Now trying to get home from Istanbul. Plane is here but should have started loading an hour ago. No explanations. May miss next flight. Will never travel with them again. Was this same problem April 2022 flight.
My wife and me were on our holiday trip to USA and taken SQ32 on 313 in SIA business Class seat 15D F. We are happy with the check in and boarding. It was very smooth although there were COVID 19 documents to verify. Crew on board was cheerful and helpful. The soup does not taste peppery at all. This need to improve as Singaporeans will not like this. I had chicken rice and the rice was super nice with the chillie. The chicken could have been better with abit more flavour. The appetizers salmons prawns were nice. Like the cheese and biscuits as well. When we were ask which red wine we would like to have Ive chosen the Barrosa red wine because I am familiar with it. At the initial stage suggest that the stewardess could have just recommend one of them since I was indecisive on which red wine to choose from. When I asked about any arrival and custom forms to fill in. A few of the steward and stewardess told us it is now done online but when we arrived the SFO ground staff told us there is no requirement for now to fill out any forms. SIA need to update their cabin crew about this as this was a bit of worry for me as I have not been to USA for 10 years. Not the cabin crews fault for this. Overall the cabin crew team on board were cheerful and helpful. We totally enjoy the flight in business class especially my wife as this is her first time in business class and she enjoy the new business class seat a lot as she was I totally worried that she could not sleep but the food down seat converted to bed was comfortable for her to sleep in.
Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul. I was mostly disappointed with the services. I flew from Montreal to Istanbul and from the beginning I felt the experience to be flawed. There were some 28 business class seats and I had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. The seat is quite comfortable and large was what I noticed at first. The cabin crew was awful. They congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. As we were in the middle of winter passengers all had heavy winter coats. I was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. I was a bit taken aback by the crews response No later later. Needless to say I was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. The crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbours at any time during this 930 hour flight. We sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. The crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. I declined the drink and was asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered champagne. All drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and I thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in Canada even on low cost carriers Menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. After take off the service was not well planned. It took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds We had just left Montreal at 1045 pm and I suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order I declined the offer for bedding and informed they that I would be ready for it after dinner. Of Course Sir anything you want. The response lacked being genuine and I felt the crew was somewhat irked. The service began with handling out a bottle of water 40 minutes into the flight. We waited another 10 or so minutes and we were asked for drinks. The Onboard Chef came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way. He would take the order for 35 seats at a time and then disappear. The whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. The food was served and it was beautifully plated. I cant say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier Ive flown in business class. The onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and I could not really see how he was a chef. He took our order chefs dont usually do this and made sure the plates looked nice. I think that is the extent of it and I dont really see any exotic or added value to this.During the whole meal my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time. I have flown many carriers in business class and I have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal. The crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive. I also experienced the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul during my connection. It is tired looking and circus like atmosphere. I qualified for the use of a resting suite. The attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when I could shower. I was there 3 hours and she never came.
Hong Kong to London via Istanbul. After I went through security and immigration I headed tow the plaza premium lounge that Turkish shares with other airlines. The lounge had poor WiFi poor food choices and unsatisfactory bathrooms. Aboard the plane the seats were in a tight 232 layout. At Istanbul airport the Turkish lounge was big but bad. At the golf simulator the balls were made out of foam and never flew straight. They had WiFi so bad I couldnt watch YouTube. Aboard my flight to Heathrow the plane and FA were the same horrible. When they served breakfast I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich but their definition of a ham and cheese sandwich didnt include ham cheese or even bread. Instead they served a disgusting scrambled egg and vegetables. I would never fly Turkish airlines again.
Very disappointing experience. London wouldnt check us in the whole way so there was a huge queue in Helsinki at the boarding gate to get our documents checked again. Secondly I had 3 lots of seat changes to my flights without asking and or notifying me of the changes. I selected 1A in advance months prior. I noticed I was moved to another seat before departure. Spoke to customer service via chat who said 1A was blocked and unserviceable. I then moved seats online to my second choice to then find in Helsinki I had been moved again and dumped in a seat right next to the engine. And of course when I boarded the flight someone was sitting in 1A when I had been told the seat was blocked and not serviceable. I feel like this airline doesnt care about their customers in business class and they just blatantly lie about everything. I gave them the opportunity to rectify the issue including providing complaintfeedback before departure which was not replied to. So its obvious they couldnt care less about the quality of their business class experience.
Below average flight. Recently I travelled in SpiceJet on 06July2022. I have travelled twice with this SpiceJet but I made a mistake giving this airline a second chance. Every time SpiceJet flight is 4050 min late so as to avoid the 60 min mark so as to evade any penalty. After deboarding the luggage took forever to come and due to it delayed flight delayed luggage I missed my connecting train for which I had paid a hefty amount in tatkaal tickets. Its mandatary to pay and choose a seat before webcheck in.
Jeddah to Dammam. Bad bad deal. 2 hours after the scheduled takeoff time Im writing this review from my seat in the plane on the tarmac. There were no announcements no updates on the screens half an hour after scheduled takeoff time. The ground staff were beyond terrible. Passengers were told they were tiring huffed and puffed at and sent from gate 2 to gate 5 to gate 2 until a passenger exploded in rage demanding to meet the supervisor granted he was loud but he was told to go away. Finally this passenger managed to go to the civil aviation office and a new flight time was displayed and the flight has still not departed 2 hours after scheduled flight time. Delays happen the aviation industry has its standards and benchmarks in todays world. A lot of work needs to be done and I would not travel on this airline again.
Security control at Dortmund airport was slow but had enough time. No checked baggage only small cabin baggage. Boarding started early we had to wait on the staircase. Seat was allocated during online checkin I had a standard window seat with limited but still enough space. Cabin crew polite and helpful. Departure and arrival were as scheduled. Food and drinks for sale no inflight entertainment. A lowcost 20 but efficient flight.
Singapore to Los Angeles. I know we paid a little extra for this oneway flight but it was totally worth it The most comfortable newest economy seats weve even seen. Large screen viewer a separate reading light bottle of water socks toothbrush and toothpaste sleeping mask fully reclining foot rest complimentary alcohol premium ice cream etc. We will fly Singapore Airlines whenever we can in the future
Naples to Gatwick. The online checkin would not work for me in accordance with the One World Frequent flyer policy. I am a Qantas frequent flyer and so I ought to have had the chance to checkin a few days ahead of the flight. The BA website would not let me do so. The bagdrop in Naples was slow and seemed rather random. Boarding was tedious. I should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card. In the mean time other passengers were allowed through the boarding gate which proved to be misleading as a transfer bus was needed. Boarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggage. The cabin crew were quite indifferent. I greeted 2 cabin crew when I boarded and neither of them smiled back. I bought a Marks and Spencer drink at an inflated price. One of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when I went to collect my bag it has been ripped by the luggage of another passenger. Disembarkation was slow and badly managed. Nobody from the crew fare welled the passengers. BA has become a lowcost airline in its service and given the cost of the ticket and the charge for a bag I will not be using them again in a hurry.
Flight Amsterdam Kos. I booked premium comfort class. Because of technical problems they changed planes. I didnt get the premium comfort extras I had paid for. They had no solutions with a bad service.
I recently flew on British Airways long haul on a flight from Philadelphia to New Delhi havinh not having travelled with British Airway for around a decade. I had been a huge fan of British Airways in the past and was very curious to see how their inflight product and entertainment had changed in that time. I also was curious to see Heathrows new Terminal 5. British Airways overall product has improved in that time. On the first leg from Philadelphia to London I was very happy to notice the new seats with excellent comfort with adjustable headrests and new Audio Video on Demand AVOD entertainment systems. I had been travelling with noise cancelling headphones which made the experience a thoroughly enjoyable one. Inflight entertainment system is sophisticated and I enjoyed their World music section in particular. The Asian vegetarian meals was of a high standard for the most part. My only criticism in this area was that on the second meal breakfast we only were served a fruit platter and had to ask for the croissants everyone else were given. In addition I found the chapatis on the DelhiLondon sector to be hard as rocks. Otherwise the meals were very good. Terminal 5 is a gem of an airport but the true highlight of the journey was on the LondonPhiladelphia sector when I had the opportunity to fly on the Dreamliner. The plane is a marvel. The windows are huge dimmable by button too. The bathrooms are larger than usual and the flight was very smooth. Additionally the legroom on the Dreamliner is impressive an improvement on the B777. And finally a word about the cabin attendants. Their level of friendliness varies from person to person but for the most part they represent the best traditions of British hospitality informal politeness. All in all I was happy with my BA trip and they continue to perform as one of my favourite airlines.
LHRPHL on a 787 Dreamliner seat 3K. I recommend seats 3K 3A 7A and 7K as you get aisle access and no other passengers have to climb over your feet when they leave their seat. The seat does feel a little claustrophobic compared to the upper deck of the 747 but its very comfortable. The service was outstanding provided by an all male crew. The food quality has improved and so has the menu choices. The entertainment system is excellent as its the Thales version on the 787 so the screens are bigger and the picture quality is better. The aircraft is also very quiet and the windows are a gimmick as you dim the windows rather than using the conventional blind.
Riga to Bordeaux. Terrible airline worst service ever humiliating experience Dont recommend anyone this airline but especially if you are musician. Stay away from them.
It was such a long time that we have not seen such a bad airline. Flight almost 3 and 4 hours you have 28 grams of salted biscuits and 25 grams of sweet biscuits Water comes without a glass. Directly from the plastic bottle And everything like that.
Twice in one trip they boarded us knowing there was a maintenance issue. Then deplaned and delayed us for hours. They lied about resolutions and refused to give concrete answers when asked direct questions about an updated departure. Employee behavior is unprofessional across the board. We drove from Texas to Monterrey to fly out enticed by the savings but have been robbed over a day of our vacation. We will be spending the extra money to fly a more expensive carrier direct next time. Their behavior is appalling. But its okay. We got 6 for a snack while we waited for our next flights.
Heathrow to Manchester. Short hop of just 35mins in the air unfortunately delayed by about the same amount of time due to someone not boarding. Done this flight a number of times and kudos to the fact they manage to get a trolley service in before landing. Alcoholic drink is free which is something considering this isnt the case even on 6hr transAmerican flights.
ZRH to LJU as a continuation to a flight with Swiss. Adria were not as good as Swiss but they did make us feel welcome onboard and look after us. The return flight was much better than the outbound flight with the cabin crew smiling and talking to passengers. The CRJ was clean and looked in better condition than other airlines equipment I have flown in the past.
I was forced to check in my trolley at the gate in Vienna. There was lots of space on the aircraft i could have put my board trolley under the seat in front of me but they said its too heavy. Avoid Austrian if you can as well as Vienna airport.
London to Bangkok. I traveled with my wife who is Thai I am British. Firstly I made a mistake with my booking and I understand that that was my fault but I was charged heavily. What was more frustrating was that I could not contact the airline personally by email as they did not respond. The telephone number supplied did not work either. To top that off my THAI wife got allocated 30kg of Luggage and me 20kg We were sat together and checked in together and the check in staff just shrugged their shoulders and said We have no control over that. I usually fly Korean Air recommend but this was my first of many trips to Thailand so I thought I would fly with the National carrier. Never again. No wonder they are going under when they need customers post covid I will say that the onboard staff were great though. The company is letting them down.
Chennai to San Francisco via Hong Kong. Extremely disappointed with Cathays check in process. The person at the check in counter straight out lied to me about the carry on baggage allowance and said that only one piece was allowed when online it says very clearly that there is one piece allowed a laptop bag for under the seat and force me to check in my carry on even after I told him that Id flown one way with the same baggage. He wouldnt put any priority tags on the baggage even though I told him there was important paper work in it. On top of that he gave me a slip saying that Cathay was not responsible for any lost baggage as the flights are operated by different carriers also a lie both the flights from and to HKG are through Cathay only. I will not be flying Cathay again until they train their representatives to be more honest.
I booked a flight to Skiathos with Monarch Airlines. It was not until my booking was confirmed and therefore could not be cancelled that it became apparent this was not a monarch aircraft but a Lithuanian carrier called SMALL PLANET. Not content with the misleading information the flight time originally 0630 from Gatwick was changed firstly to a flight 5 hours later and then changed again less than 24 hors before the flight by a further 3 hours The moral is to exercise caution and try to book a flight with a professional airline for the scheduled take off time.
Great all round. BA2591 11 October. Good price easy boarding lovely cabin crew great iced coffee on sale. Comfortable on time and a nice smile from the cabin and flight crew after a windy landing. Couldnt ask for more until they reinstate a free drink and sandwich.
Check in at First counter by a scruffy guy who wouldnt check my bag through on a connection. The ground crew were ordinary on First check in nothing special and in the lounge. Unable to answer if there was an arrivals lounge at Changi and just not interested in passengers sorry customer compared with comparable Qantas products. Managed to get upstairs at the last minute on BA11 107. Excellent cabin crew. Couldnt have been more different than on any other sector on this trip. Interesting and interested. They couldnt understand the lack of through bag at Singapore. Good food clean cabin uncomfortable and dated seat so didnt sleep much. This cabin crew probably dont go on to Sydney. Shame because they were excellent.
When I tried to check in online I was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under 300. I decided to take it but then the website wouldnt allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly but I was then told that because I had changed my booking I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The checkin agent was helpful but couldnt fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window not sitting together. After going through that the flight was surprisingly good with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy which wasnt too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic and Emma and Daniel who looked after us could not have been better. Ive obviously learned my lesson about late BA upgrades but everything else was good.
My wife and I had booked a trip to Europe. We unfortunately had to cancel the day before we were scheduled to leave due to a death in the family. I did not have trip insurance and had obtained the tickets with miles. The miles were not refundable. I called Singapore and after providing medical documentation they generously credited me my miles back so we can rebook our trip at a later date. To me this is the sign of a FIRST CLASS organization. They were in their rights not to refund the miles but they did. I have flown Singapore for years even if a had to take a second flight to arrive at my destination. I will continue to use Singapore every chance I get. I give them 5 stars for their compassion consideration and rapid response. Thank you.
Such an awful airline with 0 customer service How can they change the time of our flight so significantly twice and fail to tell us the second time around Is an email to notify your customers too much of a task for you Absolute joke
Honolulu to Kahului. Terrible experience trying to get refund for canceling travel for medical reason. We thought the mask mandate would be over when we booked our flight. Due to high blood pressure and retina vein occlusion and some loss of eyesight my husband cannot wear a mask for 14 hours. We thought the mandate would be over by now so called to cancel. The will not give a refund or rescheduled. Reschedule has to be in 3 months which we cannot get back by then and hope for mandates to end by then either. We were charged almost 400 to go one way for two of us between HNL and Maui. Refund for situations that you cannot control are nonexistent and prices rather high. No consideration for doctor report of risk for flying extended time with mask.
The outbound journey was delayed 10 hours in Port Moresby. The delayed flight was organised to leave at 2am however no ground staff at airport were organised so we sit on tarmac until ground staff arrive at 5am. The return flight from Pohpei was supposed to leave Pohnpei at 2 am and actually left 9.45am. I turned up to airport at 2 am and found out the flight was rescheduled to 9.45am. I contacted AirNuigini twice via email prior to departure to confirm that no changes had been made. I received an email saying that your servers were not working. I was not contacted about this change but others on the flight all new about this change a week before as they had booked flights only a week earlier. Therefore you new about the changes a week earlier did not advise me or even book me on the forward leg of the journey. The flight leaves Pohnpei at 9.45am but we are not booked on the continuing flight from Port Moresby to Brisbane. This flight leaves half empty and several passengers are not booked on this flight because Quants reservations are not open on Sunday. People who booked the week earlier are however on the flight. We were then sent to Sydney Airport and a connecting flight arranged to Brisbane. When we land in Sydney Qantas advise us that Air Nuigini connection to Brisbane is illegal because there is less than an hour between flights. The checkin had closed and there are no more flights that day. We are then stranded at Sydney Airport with no contact available from either Quantas or Airi Nugini. We then go to Flight Centre and are told there is only one flight left to Brisbane at a cost of 800. Some passengers take this option but I dont trust the airline to compensate me. So I am stranded with nobody to contact In Sydney at 7pm at night. Luckily some stranger took pity on me and let me sleep on their couch for the night. I contacted your airline in the morning and I was rebooked to Brisbane at 11am with Qantas. Qantas then advised that my 2 bags of 15kg were subject to excess baggage fee of 70. Eventually I got home at 12pm in Brisbane.
This is my second time to take Cathay Pacific flying from Manila to San Diego via Hong Kong. The food served was really bad with an after taste not to mention the fact that the flight was 2.5 hrs delayed. We were held inside the aircraft for 2hrs and the other 30mins was due to late boarding. I wont take Cathay Pacific anymore. The only positive thing is their legroom which is more spacious than other airlines.
First InterCaribbean Airways cancelled our flight from Provodenciales to Grand Turk then they cancelled our departure from Grand Turk with no notice. After multiple phone call and email attempts I have not received a Customer Service reply other than automated to my online request to my complaint on dated December 31 regarding reservations number AAX6F9 on InterCaribbean Airways. The 840 AM flight from GDT to PLS was cancelled and InterCaribbean Airways brought in another plane from Jamaica to take passengers to PLS 3 hours later than scheduled. This resulted in our 4 passengers party missing our connecting flight to FLL on Jet Blue at a loss of over 1724.06 half of the total round trip fare of 3448.12 from FLLPLS. We then had to purchase 4 additional tickets on Southwest Airlines at a cost of 1101.08. In total we are inconvenienced by InterCaribbean a total of 2825.14 as the Jet Blue flight was not refundable. Our final destination was not FLL and we had multiple connecting flights that we had to make. We were connected from FLL to Seattle WA then onto Anchorage Alaska and finally proceeding to Kodiak Alaska. It was imperative that we make it to the US Mainland and our connecting flights. Staying in Provo overnight if we could find lodging over the holiday to wait for a hypothetical flight on InterCaribbean to FLL was not an option. We would have had a loss of over 8000.00 if we missed our return connections. We are very fortunate that Southwest Airlines had seats remaining as our entire return flight schedule was in jeopardy. I was diligent over our holiday in checking the status of InterCaribbeans flight to GDT since they cancelled our incoming flight and I was forced to book with Caicos Express just to get to Grand Turk a week prior to our departure date. I checked email the morning of the flight for notifications we were at the airport by 700 AM before ticketing agents were even there. We were not told of the cancelled flight and rerouting of the new plane until 45 minutes post boarding time or approximately 930 AM. InterCaribbean Airways ticketing agent was very courteous and obviously tried all he could do thereafter but was basically ineffective. We finally received a refund for the cancellation of the incoming InterCaribbean flight from PLS to GDT a total of 29 days after the cancellation of the flight and we had to ultimately make multiple request for a refund. I had to call long distance to customer service to request initially. It was not an automatic refund. It also took 2 additional follow up phone calls and multiple emails to get this 320 refund on a supposed refundable ticket as it never showed up in my account as a credit. Unacceptable. I incurred 37.00 in longdistance phone service charges just to ensure InterCaribbean Airways did their job. The incompetence demonstrated by InterCaribbean on our return flight was the final straw to a disastrous vacation. Not only did it cost us thousands of dollars the added stress eliminated any benefit our pathetic vacation supplied.
Belgrade to Zurich. Employees are rude noncaring and just dont care for passengers. Instead of helping passengers with their questions and problems they brush them off and keep doing what they were doing before someone even asked them for help that is nothing Even though Im a Serbian myself I experienced firsthand their hospitality and their nonwillingness to help many times Tonight it was enough as far as Im concerned I wouldnt use Air Serbia There are many more airlines that are much better than them. Not to mention cheaper.
Very good all business class flight only issue experienced was the slow bag delivery upon arrival in JFK. Food exceptional and service provided was good. The seats were full flat. Ipad provided for inflight entertainment with several films tv shows etc. A good flight albeit a little expensive.
I would like to compliment the cabin crew on this flight. Their attitude and attention to detail reminded me of the good old Ansett Airline days where the staff took great pride in looking after their passengers. You could see that they just enjoyed what they we doing especially Sergios contagious smile beaming the full length of the aircraft that topped off an overall excellent experience. I was fortunate to get the same on my return flight ZL152 on 14 Dec 2022. Please thank this team for a job well done. Rex Airlines has definitely become my number one choice when flying domestically.
Had such a great experience on SQ278 yesterday from ADL to SIN. At last someone listened. As I have allergies I have been given the same chicken breast with carrots etc. After hearing that I have been bringing my own food on board to eat. This crew made their own version of cup noodles with chicken plus they had mushroom soup for me because I mentioned about NZ and CX flights where they made protein shake and chicken soup for me not on the menu. Its these small little things that can make one happy. Thank you Singapore Airlines. Wish they had wifi on board.
Breakfast was not served until 10 am so asked for a cup of tea at about 9 am to be told no because service starts in 10 mins. 1 hour later still waiting. However the worst part was the layover in Doha. We are Qantas Gold members and were not allowed in the Business Lounge we got the runaround and were eventually directed to a below quality lounge with inadequate bathroom facilities.
The flight was better in some areas than I expected not so good in others. I booked this flight with TUI in around February. I didnt expect much as this was a budget airline but I didnt expect it to be terrible. To start with ground service. I dont mean to moan but a 2 hour ground delay after boarding before spending another 8 hours in the same seat wasnt exactly nice. Secondly the seats. Legroom wasnt great but it was bearable Im pretty big so that was expected for the most part. The food surprised me in a good way quite good food. Keep in mind food on the return will not be as good from America though. The crew were nice I suppose nothing special. The IFE wasnt great but it was fine considering its a leisure airline. Would I recommend TUI Long Haul Yes if its your only choice.
Awful experience. Plane was late leaving UK and returning with no explanation at check in. Both ways we had a very long wait no seating whilst waiting for the gate to open. We had a 4 year old with us but were not offered a complimentary bottle of water and drinks on board the plane were extortionate. Will not fly with this airline again.
Ive tried flying this airline twice in business class. Both times have been chaos. Save yourself some grief pay the extra money and fly a better airline. Pros Airplane cabin staff were helpful and attentive. Flights to Europe are lower in cost. Cons Customer service is awful. Ill comment on our first experience which after 4 months our case is still unresolved. Our flight was scheduled to take off at 7pm Aug. 26 from Portland Oregon to Frankfurt Germany. We had a hotel scheduled for the night of arrival and a connecting flight to Stockholm scheduled for the next day. On Aug. 26 at 1037am we received an alert that our flight was delayed to the next day 24 hours. We immediately had to change our airport transportation 1 connecting flight and 2 hotel reservations. We had to pay a 50 fee to reschedule the connecting flight. Almost 47 minutes later we received a corrected alert that our flight was delayed NOT to the next day It was delayed 1hr 25min on the same day Aug. 26 in reality we werent able to board the plane for more than two hours. After the corrected alert we could not get airport transportation our original connecting flight was full so we had to purchase new connecting flight tickets at the premium price and rebook both hotels. The additional cost to us was over 5813. I regularly followup with Condor Airlines about the status of our claim. Their response continues to ask for patience due to high volume of incoming mail. The delay was not due to weather and the counter and gate staff could offer no explanation. We tried inquiring to file a claim for a partial refund but were told to contact Condor customer service which is a black hole of no response.
10 April 2015 Airbus A320 Business Heathrow to Rome FCO. A total waste of money. The food was tea there was no entertainment system and the only difference I could find from premium coach or regular coach was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. As alcoholic beverages are provided for all classes theres nothing to be gained there the seat pitch was pathetic and aside from having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had was boarding and deplaning first. Dont waste your money unless someone else is paying for it.
Singapore to London Heathrow. Yet another excellent flight on Singapore Airlines despite flying on the older product. The older A380 was operating this 14hour flight from Singapore to London but I still enjoyed the seat. My cabin was nearly empty and we could choose whatever seat we wanted. The seat was huge it had a lot of legroom width and was very comfortable. Unfortunately the IFE was not touchscreen and it was not very responsive which would be expected for a 13yearold system. There were still a large variety of movies and TV shows in the entertainment system. The crew were friendly helpful and provided excellent service they really made the flight enjoyable. The food was absolutely delicious. I could hardly tell the difference between this airline food and food on the ground. We arrived in London on time.
Evening flights between KRK and CPH are often delayed at least 1h just because the plane did not make it on time from the previous route. Poor logistics of the company move the landing time of the delayed flights to e.g. 2 AM which causes sleep deprivation of the traveller and greatly increases the cost of the trip as often the only option to get home at this hour is to take a taxi.
Never before have I encountered an airline with less interest in its customers. 1 Passengers were not informed of a 3 hour delay forcing us to wake at 5.00am for a 7.50am flight and then wait in the airport departure lounge until 10.15am. 2 It is now 1.11pm we are still in the departure lounge and the flight has been delayed until 4.00pm with no guarantee of departure. 3 No attempt has been made to transfer passengers to other flights or airlines worse it was actively opposed. 4 No attempt has been made to compensate passengers for LA day hotel and other expenses incurred. 5 No attempt has been made to soften the inconvenience by providing access to the Lounge or other customer service.
Flew Thomson from London Gatwick to Mauritius. My first time flying in the Boeing Dreamliner and despite initially being sceptical on all the hype about the airy cabin environment I have to say both outbound and inbound flights were the best I have encountered when flying Premium Economy cabin long haul. Being of 6 foot 2 inches in height and weighing 18 stone I found the premium ecomomy seating extremely comfortable seat 3G both ways and even got the passenger in front of me to fully recline their seat to see if it impinged on my comfort it did not. Both flights were punctual I believe this had a lot to do with the well administered boarding arrangements at both airports. The service in Premium Economy was first rate the outbound flight having slightly the edge over the inbound one with the food quality seeming to be of a better standard on the flight out. The cabin staff were very frequent visitors with the drinks trolley especially during the early stage of the journey and this probably contributed to me spending a large portion of the outbound night flight sleeping. I cannot comment on the cabin media as I did not watch any films but my wife says that TUI could do with updating their film offerings. In summary very comfortable flights with good service. I would definitely fly Thomson Airways Premium Economy cabin on the Boeing Dreamliner again.
Gatwick to Antigua. A frequent flyer with BA for over 15 years Silver exec club I have seen the steadily decline of this airline particularly over the past 18 months Alex Cruz take over. my partner and I fly regularly in ecoprem and club depending on prices so have seen the decline across all classes. recent trip to Antigua from LGW was awful. A pretty empty cabin filthy isnt the word awful in flight entertainment Rockwell that hasnt changed in 10 years easily. Food choice is no longer a choice its a meat dish or veg. alcoholic beverages are loaded at origin LGW for both legs so they have now halved what they usually stocked previously. 3 hours into flight there was no spirits left bearing in mind only one drink had been served prior to the meal service 1.5 hours in to the flight. BA state in their motto to fly to serve. Yes they certainly are flying but most certainly not serving. The cabin crew are ashamed and embarrassed at the cuts which is evident in their conversations at the back of the aircraft and to anyone who speaks to them they are disgusted with what the bosses have done. They have cheapened the brand of the national carrier but havent cheapened their prices. easyjet and Ryanair offer superior and on long haul its got to the point I will now fly Virgin and others again offer more for your money in all aspects of the flight. Stop trying to make BA budget we want it back to how it used to be All I can say is the compensation passengers will be receiving following the major IT glitch a fortnight ago is one way of paying customers back for the awful attitude and decline in British Airways.
As expected the plane arrived late and caused a 1.5 hour delay but to their credit they managed to turn the plane around in just a mere 45 minutes including disembarking boarding and paperwork therefore partially making up for lost time. Just factor in a delay of an hour or two and be mentally prepared for it to happen from such a nofrills airline and one will keep expectations in check. The crew took pride in their work and executed their job well.
The worst experience I have ever had. They lost my baggage during my transfer in Warsaw and destroyed it. There was a lot of expensive stuff inside and nothing perishable as they claimed. I will never use this airline again even if I have to pay several times more for a ticket.
Checking in at 0600 in Cape Town along with my husband and 20 month old baby for our flight back to Whk at 0800 we were casually informed that our plane was inserviceble and would hopefully be ready for departure at 1000. Needless to say that did not happen and we departed at 1800 that evening without much of an explanation or apology. My husband dared his next venture with Air Namibia on 21 March and was casually informed 5hours before his flight that it was cancelled but had been rebooked on a SAL flight to be booked in within 2 hours which turned out not to be true after confirming the booking with SAL ourselves. We live 500km away from Whk and cannot be on standby to be ready for their flight changes as it suits them We have always been regular travelers with Air Namibia but unfortunately it seems not to be safe anymore to rely on their unserviceable planes or their inconsiderate service.
Kuwait To Munich Via Doha. The Kuwait To Doha flight was operated on an a bit old but good A330300 The Doha To Munich was operated on a great Boeing B777300ER. Starting from the short 50 minute KWIDOH Flight it was great Good and comfortable aircraft screens were a bit outdated on the A330 but still has the latest oryx one movies. the legroom was fantastic however window seats only have an IFE Box under each seat blocking legroom. Service on that short flight was great Cabin crew were very nice beautiful deep blue mood lighting which created a beautiful atmosphere Inside the cabin and the flight was OnTime. Connection In Doha was super easy smooth and efficient beautiful super modern airport with great toilets range of shops and restaurants and very nice staff. Boarding Started few minutes after the landing from Kuwait so we rushed to our next flight to Munich. Second flight was operated on a new and very comfortable Boeing B777300ER as much as people complained about the 10 abreast 777 I found it to be actually good Legroom was amazing Seat recline was excellent NO IFE box under the seat blocking legroom on the B777. On demand high resolution screens beautiful mood lighting with nice refreshing towels being distributed. What Impressed me the most Is the Qatar Airways New Super WiFi I was told that it was the fastest and best In the Air. Even a YouTube video would be played. And WiFi Is cheap on Qatar Airways 30 Minutes for free and only 10USD for the duration of the flight no matter how long. The OryxOne Inflight Entertainment System was excellent and offered a lot of great movies and TV Shows After departure the snack service commenced they served a Quisine savory snack sandwiches it was very good much better snacks then what they used to serve before. It was a good chicken pizza sandwich not the dry chicken sandwiches they used to serve. Since It was a night flight Cabin lights were dimmed Into mood lighting which created a beautiful atmosphere onboard the crew kept serving beverages every 30 minutes they were very nice and helpful. Few hours later they served breakfast I ordered a special Hindu Meal request It was delicious at least better than the normal meal they serve. That wasnt my first time flying Qatar Airways but I really have to say Qatar Airways has Improved a lot since my last flight with them almost 9 months ago. Much Better cheaper and faster WiFi better savory snacks better breakfasts better refreshed Oryx Entertainment System. Looking forward for my return flight with Qatar Airways again soon.
I will start by saying that the plane accommodations were outstanding the in flight crew was amazing. That being said the baggage handling is atrocious and the customer service is even worse. We gate checked our stroller and car seat only for the gate agent to tell us that we would have to retrieve it at baggage claim and it would not be brought to the gate. Completely defeats the purpose of checking in at the gate. Next was how our baggage was handled. Our car seat which was gate checked did not make our destination keep in mind that our flight was only 35 full and delayed at the transfer in Helsinki for one hour. Then on arrival at least 2030 of the passengers received an email that some or all of their luggage did not make the transfer. This must be laziness on the part of the ground crew in Helsinki because there is no reason this many bags did not make the flight. People with kid people with turn around flights people with transfers to other cities and countries were being told their bags would not arrive for 2 days or more. Our car seat that was gate checked was placed on the carousel not the oversized baggage belt. The frame was damaged and it has been over one month and Finnair has not even responded to the emails or claims we have made in their system. This is unacceptable our carseat ended up being delayed for 3 days and Finnair has not even reimbursed us for having to rent one for those days from the car rental agency. This level of incompetence is the highest I have ever experienced from and airline. If you travel Finnair be prepared to have your baggage not arrive with you.
Manchester to Hurghada. The aircraft used for this 5hr flight is in my opinion unsuitable. The seats dont recline and are quiet hard no entertainment system or charging ports and its not like the lack of amenities are hugely reflected in the ticket price but the flight crew were very friendly and professional so not all bad.
Width of the seats is unacceptable. I can recommend business class I advise against a longer economy class flight due to the seats.
Dubai to Gothenburg via Paris. First time flying with Air France since 2004. The service was as good as I remembered. The food and drinks were very good. After take off a nice snack with a chicken salad bread croissant and a dessert with a nice hot breakfast before landing. The crew were very nice and service minded. On the second flight with HOP also great service and a nice snack included.
Flight and crew great the problems came when we had to deal with the Orlando check in staff and customer complaints in uk. Total nightmare and they just did not care at all. Our seats were booked 3 months in advance as we had a small baby with us. When arriving at Orlando airport to return home the check in agent changed our seats to mid row and no bassinets. We noticed before going through security and returned to advise to get our seats that we had booked back. This turned into 2 hours of sheer hell with the staff including airport manager while my baby screamed the place down hungry as we could not go through security until they had rectified the problem. The staff were rude and arrogant and refused to admit they had messed up and refused to change our seats back as they had seated someone else there who had no baby. Even though these seats are reserved for people with babies due to the bassinet availability. Eventually it was changed back after so much stress and hassle. On returning we complained and 3 times we got the answer yes it was our fault we are sorry but we cant give anything to say sorry for our behaviour. Eventually after another complaint they agreed to 3000 avios and 25 voucher. I wont be flying with British Airways again as they are so bad in customer relations and check in agents leave a lot to be desired.
Outbound 11 March Dubai to Tehran and return on 13 March. I always select Mahan for my Dubai Tehran trips. Its a budget airline but the food service and staff hospitality are on par with any top airlines of the world. Seats are comfortable enough leg room delicious food. Very smooth take off and landing.
Very new plane. Seats were by far the most uncomfortable Ive ever flown. And Ive flown a lot. Im average height 511 and 170 lbs not big or fat and my knees were very tight in seat. Plastic seats with almost no cushions plastic armrest with no padding no recline at all. And it was a new plane. Carry on bag over 70. I put them on my no fly list
The single worst airline experience of my life. This airline is a joke. Absolute disgrace to abandon passengers in Manila airport with no food water or information Would definitely have not booked had I known this is how they treat passengers
BangkokParo return via Kolkotta on the way out and Gaya on the way back. Business class. The overall experience was good food drink and FA service was of a very good standard. Its worth paying the little extra for business class 40 per person each way as the seats are roomy and comfortable plus you get lounge access at both Bangkok and Paro although the Paro lounge is a bit quaint. The other reason for booking business class is if your flight gets delayed as ours did on the return journey for around five hours. Theres little in the way of facilities at Paro airport so its worth the extra for a more comfortable place to wait and enjoy free drinks of course. Make sure you sit on the left hand side on the flight into Paro as you get the best views of the Himalayas. And finally dont be worried about the descent into Paro as the plane does get worryingly close to the mountainsides.
Totally trash. They delayed for 2 hours first and then additional 3 hours. And it was only for 2 hours flight to Sarasota. They told that there is heavy air traffic at Sarasota but when I checked over Flight Radar there wasnt a huge amount of traffic. They are lying to customers.
Barcelona to Tel Aviv. One of the last flights of the 747 for El Al before they will be replaced by the new 787 8 or 9. Well it was a vintage flight with an old aircraft that we all loved. The business seats are like they are from the 90s so no real flat bed and the audio was very old without VOD etc. Service was good as usual but food was embarrassing. El Al changed the menu and now serve only sandwiches for EU flights. Very basic poor and absolutely not enough for an almost 5hr flight.
Mina at the service desk at Salt Lake City was exceptional. Top notch customer service. She really made us feel like we were valued customers. Would definitely fly delta again.
I am a frequent traveller and have had an opportunity to travel via multiple air lines My tour on 12th March 2022 with Qatar Air Ways flight QR070 was first one but was very best. I was first class treatment in an economy class cabin. The hospitality and cooperation from cabin crew was extra ordinary. Food was delicious air craft was well maintained and facilities were impressive. The crew members were professional organized and helpful.
Went to BKK via Heathrow on 26th October. Was all excited to be flying back to Thailand. I know direct flights are better but longer but thought flying with the UK flag carrier I was going to get a good flight. Well to be honest I was disappointed I was at least expecting to be able to charge a phone onboard only to be told only in business class. Most other airlines have this facility in economy. No menus for food and 2 options and same with breakfast. Drinks were limited to soft and only wine and beer. Inflight entertainment was poor at best and was bored witless with films I have seen before or had no interest in. Even the documentaries were all BBC which were ok. Music was equally lacklustre and limited. Only saving grace was the seat I was in and that was the only positive aspect despite the fact there was a baby crying most of the time. Sorry BA. I was expecting a good experience but felt let down and disappointed.
This was my worst travel experience with Qantas I flew with them before but their quality seems to be going downhill I flew to Singapore via Brisbane I was only informed at the airport that my flight from Brisbane to Singapore was delayed 8hours No prior notification received through email or even their own app whatsoever. When I landed in Brisbane at least they could have given me vouchers or something or access to their airport lounge for such a long delay. Very disappointed in Qantas.
Very pleasant experience There was a delay for sure but this is almost normal these days. The temperature in the plane was comfortable the movies were good almost 200 movies to choose from the seat was comfortable and the legroom as in other planes.
I flew yesterday from MRU to FCO on the B767300 763 registered IAIGG. When I read the reviews on here I was a bit worried about the flight. Its true the flight was fours hours late and I didnt receive any notification from Meridiana. For a planned 6am flight four hours makes a big difference when you need to wake up early. I checked with the airport and they advised to come four hours later. The flight itself was fine. The economy seats are high density but they are comfortable. The crew were excellent and really did a good job throughout the flight. Foodwise it was fine but for a 10.5 hour flight the offerings were a little thin. The addition of a free service bar would be a useful addition.
LHR to PHL on 787 online check in worked well T5 first class lounge very nice good choice of drinks available food could be better but nothing to complain about. Priority boarding worked well too. Service always very good flying every month to the US. Did not eat anything because I wanted only to sleep. Had seat 3e middle seat at the end of the first club world cabin which gives you a lot of private space. Entertainment system good but a better selection necessary. Overall I can recommend BA however on most of the Asian airlines you have roomier seats.
Really rude staff have no idea what theyre doing. Demanded 150 for a bag I already paid for. Waste of time and energy. They have cheap tickets but they demand more money for bags and everything.
Siem Reap to Bangkok. They wait for unassuming customers to come to the counter and hold them hostage with check in baggage fees. Online there is no reference the fee doubling when paid at counter. You cant pay online at counter. Even in the US domestic flights charge 35 for first check in. If you dont pre check online 5 hours before the flight you will be charged 40 for 15kg. Online you pay 22 for up to 20kg. I do not recommend this Thai AirAsia.
My travel day was June 2 at 0035 arrived to the airport on time boarding start at 1150 pm. Coming close to the take off time the fly got delayed the claim is due to one of the air staff was being sick. They started requested how they need about 10 passengers to give up their seat offering new book and hotel stay which I found weird. Boarding started to commence they kept requesting passengers to give up seats and rebook. The airplane was loaded back to front by the time my section was called rows 1 15 we werent getting on the plane. We were volunteered to give up our seats claiming ones again due to short staffing on the plane. All my years of flying Ive never come across this or heard of this. I feel theres a big scam here they over book the flight made all these promises well get a full refund along with the cost of booking another flight with another airline. Im still waiting on someone to reach out Ive called the customer service number has they open 7am 3 days back to back and look the line is busy Ive waited on hold for 1.5 hour out of one of the 3 days trying to get someone. So Im out the money on the flight with lynx and paid extra for another the same day in the morning 0630. In total I paid 680.79 for a 1 way flight for 2 airlines because of this.
My flight from Sydney to Doha connecting to Munich got cancelled due to technical issues after we were sitting in the airplane at the gate for 3 hours. I had to stand in line for another 3 hours to get a hotel for the night. Airport staff took my contact details and I was promised to get informed by the airline about the new departure time. As the airport staff ran out of taxi vouchers we had to pay for our own taxi to the hotel and were promised to be payed back the next day. I was never informed by any Qatar staff about my new departure time. As the airplane was still broken the next day they had to rebook us on different flights. I had to spend 25 hours on the phone to a call centre agent in India who rebooked me on a different routing. At the airport I was not able to claim my taxi money back. After arriving with 20 hour delay in Munich I went to the Qatar Airways office to claim my taxi money back and was given a sheet of paper with an email address where I should write my claim to. I wrote my claim and never got an answer or any money back. After calling the Call centre again I was told this time that the email address was wrong. So who knows if I will ever be reimbursed. Not even speaking about any other compensation.
Vancouver to London. Very poor experience my flight with BA. the 242 business is not nice as much as crowded as economical class. One toilet closed nobody around to repair . on one point BA even better than asian companies. its even more freezing. why do we need to freeze in such a 9 hours trip no staff to answer my question. no staff to make it better. one good point the seat are surprisingly comfortable but easy to make it better.
Flew Turkish Airlines from Bangkok to Istanbul. Food was good. Entertainment good. Temperature control very cold. We asked the cabin crew 4 times to increase the temperature as everybody was covered with blankets. Unfortunately the flight was delayed and we didnt make it to our next flight although we reached the gate 15 mins before departure. The company dealt with this well providing accommodation dinner and the next available flight the next day.
My Business Class flight from RJK to LHR was business in name and cost only. Despite the online reservation system clearly indicating that the central seat on the A319 is left vacant consistent with my experience of other Star Alliance partners an upgraded passenger was put in the seat next to me and the response from the airline was only that they do not guarantee the extra space. This is an extremely misleading reservation system and doesnt help when your partner has booked the aisle seat thinking they are next to you. The only communication from the cabin crew regarding the move was to ask me whether I would mind moving to let him have the window seat The airport had no business facilities there was no sparkling wine the food was extremely poor I was not even able to get a second piece of butter for my bread and my baggage with its priority tag was one of the last to arrive at LHR after a 45 minute wait. Considering the large price gap I am left wondering what exactly that money paid for as I am certain that a slice of ham and bowl of cereal cannot cost over 100 GBP themselves
Absolutely horrible service cabin crew doesnt speak English they are rude and not friendly especially if you ask them to speak in English. Very uncomfortable seats dirty cabin average food and no wifi at all not even an option to pay for it it doesnt exist When I asked if my connected flight was waiting because the original flight was delayed they were rude and not helpful at all Entertainment below average earphones that are not working usb plug cant be used to charge your phone no power coming out of it. Blankets and pillows smell bad and dont look clean at all even though they were packed in a bag. Absolutely horrible I would never use their services again
Almaty to Bishkek. Have flown this route number of times in past year sometimes via TSE the older version of Embraer used which in my view is more comfortable than the new model in their fleet. All Sectors on schedule very pleasant crew.
Gatwick to Rome return. Outward flight the plane was full. Booked and paid for an aisle seat but no legroom and narrow seat. Did not eat on the aircraft. Landed on time. Return flight left Rome late again full. This time I booked and paid for aisle seat near emergency exit more leg room. Food on the plane was from MS. Chose the ploughmans option having looked at the glossy catalogue. The food bore little resemblance to the photograph dry and not filled. I feel sorry for the cabin crew as it takes them ages to serve the food receive payment you cant use cash and then clear it all up. Passengers near the rear of the aircraft would be lucky to be served. British Airways European flights are nothing more than a nofrills airline. So much cost cutting it opens the door to look at other cheaper options offering the same service. This is not good enough.
YEGSEA economy. Checkin efficient mentioned I was connecting internationally and got the 15 bag fee waived. Flight a little late but well informed and crew apologised. Good communication from the cockpit nice CRJ aircraft in good condition with ample legroom leather seats. Inflight service was surprising 2pm flight with free beer wine and pretzels with topups throughout the flight. No IFE but for 1.5 hours who cares. Friendly and obliging crew.
The worst experience ever. They charge you a lot for 2 or 3kg extra luggage. You cant pay with USD or Euro only pesos. The staff is playing it stupid and did not mention the possibility to pay online. Indeed I do not recommend and the aircraft is prehistoric ATR 72600 from the eighties For me its a big s.cam
Milan to Houston via Paris. The flights were okay as usual but my luggage arrived to Houston destroyed. I saw no Air France agents in the arrival. I took my luggage directly home and filled a claim form. I got an email with no case number or reference saying that I will get an answer in 2 weeks or little longer. Nothing happened after one month and I contacted customer services .. and they told me to refill the claim. I did on November 11 and I got another email identical to the previous one.
Bari to London via Rome and had 2 very different flight experiences. I booked my flights several months ahead of travel for my summer holiday and found the Alitalia site to be very efficient and user friendly. Alitalia emailed me a reminder to checkin online and so that side of things proved to be impressive and reliable. Checkin at Bari was quick and the gentleman who checked me in made pleasant small talk and was very polite. The flight from Bari to Rome was on an A320 the aircraft was clean and the interior well presented. Boarding was well managed and the flight departed slightly early and reached Rome 10 mins ahead of schedule. During this short flight the friendly and well turned out crew served drinks and were a great credit to their company. Disembarkation was most efficient and orderly. I transferred from the domestic terminal to terminal E for the flight to London. This flight was on a clearly older A320. Boarding was not orderly as too many passengers had far too much hand luggage. The flight was delayed for over 90 minutes on the runway and no announcements were made by the captain at all. Most of the cabin crew disappeared and left one lady to try and answer questions from worried passengers. One passenger was told that storms over London had caused the delay and another person said there was power failure at Heathrow. This was all hearsay and not at all beneficial to passengers. I noted how a captain from another airline was treated like a king by the cabin crew. He was placed by the emergency seat and another passenger moved to enable this. Two Mexican ladies sat next to me and were concerned about missing their flight to Mexico City. The same cabin crew member who fussed over the captain waved her hands at the Mexicans and said it was not her job to know about connecting flights. During this flight a small drink was served and a snack consisting of a micro packet of biscuits. When I arrived at Heathrow I found that my case had been broken. I had to find a place to report this and was assisted by a young man who was clearly not coping well. Apparently quite a few bags on the flight did not even arrive in London. I shall hesitate to use Alitalia for international flights but should I need a domestic flight I shall consider them The poor communication was a great concern and the indifferent staff on the Rome to London flight were a cause for concern.
I took biz class flight from Beijing to Taipei. The overall service was good but I ordered a fruit platter and that was a very basic one the presentation was not good and the fruit quality was not either. But the crew was attentive and pleasant I hope Air China can improve the food as there is only so much a crew member can do to make up the overall customer experience. Air Chinas aircraft and seatings in biz class are on the par with some airlines.
London to Kochi via Bahrain. The flight from London to Bahrain was alright. However in the second flight form Bahrain to Kochi the plane was very old. Service was rude and food quality poor. Same in the return in the flight from Kochi to Bahrain the plane was very old clearly outdated. I would not fly with them again it was scary.
I booked roundtrip flight from LAX to Bangkok via Taipei for January 2020. Since the time I booked the flight 5 months ago the flight times were changed at least 5 times. The latest arrival time is much later than the original arrival time which created a problem for my plans. I cancelled the fight but was charged 200 cancellation fee 100 for each person in the booking. Since my cancellation was due to China Airlines change of schedule the 200 cancellation fee should be waived. But China Airline refused to refund.
Do not fly this airline. Bait and switch tactics used. Nothing but fees for everything. Starts off the lowest airline out there. After you pick all the options like the seat you want which all of them cost money. You pay more than a reputable airline. No thanks do not buy
In April my husband and I had booked business class seats from Bermuda to London on British Airways. The flight was cancelled and we were rebooked on the next day in premium economy and to date two months later no refund or compensation. We are gold card members and fly to London business class about 1214 times a year. The service from Customer Relations is absolutely unbelievable. Last September I had glass in my foot on a flight from Bermuda to London as a result of flight crew dropping drinking glasses and not cleaning up properly. No compensation. British Airways has the monopoly on flights from Bermuda to London and the service is simply terrible. What really bothers me is that no one cares from British Airways and I have no idea of where to lodge a complaint.
Dublin to Paris CDG. Service onboard was impeccable. Served a lovely salmon dish with a nice roll ratatouille cheese and a nice chocolate cake for desert. Everything was well presented and the stewardess very professional and friendly. Priority boarding was efficient but I wonder why boarding announcement was made way before boarding could start. Overall service from check in and lounge experience were good but for some reason my baggage despite flying business class and supposedly priority came out quite late with no priority sticker on it.
Where do I start. This was my first flight with Qatar and its the best flight I have ever experienced. I flew business and it was actually better the BAs First class. From start to finish the customer service was exceptional. The check in process was fantastic. I love the little seating area and fresh drink when you arrive. The lounge at Heathrow was fantastic particularly the staff who couldnt do enough for you. It is without doubt the best food Ive ever had on an aircraft Ive added photos so you can see and again the best service. I really couldnt fault anything. You clearly get what you pay for and other airlines could learn a lot from Qatar. Thank you for looking after me. It was a pleasure flying with you.
Flew Southampton to Dubai via Paris CDG. Our first long haul flight with Air France we chose their business class over BA Club world even though it meant changing aircraft. The whole experience was excellent. I lost my computer in Paris and the ground crew amazingly found it and bought it to the lounge for me. Lounge in hall L 2 F was brand new and excellent. Slight delay caused by heavy snow. On board was new business cabin really comfortable seat. Food exquisite and beverages all good. Cabin crew all excellent. Can not fault them.
Never again I will book Bulgaria Air. We booked in October 2015 7 tickets to fly the 1st June 2016 to Sofia for a citytrip. They already changed a few times the hours of the flight. The return was to be in the evening and now they changed it to 6amin the morning. And last week they changed the depart from 9am in the morning to 20.25 in the evening. So we lose 2 days of our city trip. Never again
I unfortunately missed my flight by minutes However the staff were very professional reassuring and efficient in helping me to rectify my mistake. I would like to thank those staff members from the bottom of my heart for making what seemed impossible possible What a great team of people there is at Gold Coast airport Thank you again
If you have a physical disability do not expect any help from these people. I am a wheelchair user and this was my first time flying since becoming disabled so I was already nervous. We received 210 assistance getting to my seat. When we landed a flight attendant clapped her hands and said chop chop time to get to work To my mother to assemble my chair and received no assistance obtaining parts from the overhead compartment. Coming back to Florida we relied on other very nice passengers to hold the flow of people moving so we could get off. My mother had to carry 2 large carryon bags a purse and wheelchair seats and handles all the way to the gate entrance with no help. The attendants coming home were very nice but should have at the very least held the flow of passengers getting off. We will never fly this airline again.
Flight of march 2020 was logically cancelled. We requested a refund which the system said was being processed and could take up to 45 days. Since then no money and no more contact. Phoned multiple times waiting time up to an hour and when finally in the call being pressed away again.
Ho Chi Minh City to Seoul. Asiana Airlines is the third 5Star airline that I have travelled after Eva Air and ANA. It is clear that Asians airlines are better than others. Cabin crews were very kind skilled and the meal was very good. Asiana deserves to be rated 5Star.
I flew from Singapore to Jakarta on Jetstar Asia codeshare with Jet Airways. The flight was quite comfortable for the short flight. The legspace and seat width and support was comfortable. Since it was a codeshare flight I got a complementary snack and beverage which was sufficient and good for the flight duration.
We flew from London Gatwick to Olbia Sardinia with Meridiana. The booking was a nightmare the online computer kept crashing and requesting me to try again. After numerous failed attempts I rang the call centre for help all they could do was to instruct me to try booking two single tickets surprise surprise this too failed a whole day wasted and nothing to show for it. The following day an instinct made me ring my credit card and was horrified to find that two payments had been taken from my account by Meridiana yet no tickets provided. To cut a long story short a total of 7 emails largely unanswered and 4 phone calls totaling 67 minutes at a cost of 37 I eventually got my tickets but no refund. Fortunately the credit card company were on the ball and credited the money owing. This call centre is beyond useless I am dreaming that they may actually refund my phone bill. Having received my eticket the online check in was okay albeit in Italian but there was no indication that the operation was sucessful. Boarding passes arrived the next day by email but were torn up on arrival at Gatwick how odd standard tickets issued. The check in was amazing for Gatwick so quiet no queues and unhurried we seemed almost to be the only passengers. The staff were friendly and we had plenty of time to stroll to the gate once announced boarding was delayed resulting in a 30 minute late take off. The aircraft a Boeing 737300 was around 20 years old but it was fine a capacity of around 120 is much lower than the regular 737s with less than 100 passengers the whole process through the airport was unhurried. The flight was uneventful but we were given a roll and drink most unexpected these days. My seat itself was comfortable but at 6 3 I did find my knees digging into the seat in front not so good. There were two empty rows of emergency seats behind me but perversly was not allowed to sit there without paying extra. A thought crossed my mind I have flown in these seats many times with other airlines and I have always been instructed to familiarise myself with the proceedure of opening the emergency exit in case of an emergency. Maybe Meridiana are operating within airline regulations but with no one sitting next to the exit with knowledge how long would it take for somebody to reach the exit read and understand the instructions then execute during panic and possible darkness A disaster waiting to happen. The departure from Olbia was equally quiet and laid back and the flight to Gatwick uneventful.
Brilliant service from the cabin crew and CaptainFirst Officer on this much delayed LisbonLHR flight. BA have questions to answer another LisbonLHR flight which was heavily delayed this happens regularly another BA flight from Lisbon with a remote boarding location and poor management prior to boarding. Our two hour delay all after we had boarded was handled brilliantly by the crew with regular communication refreshments and as jovial atmosphere as was possible. But BA must face up to the astonishingly poor lounge in Lisbon the poor management of boarding and a limp response to questions.
I had my flight booked for 1st October from Goa to Hyderabad. The flight time being around an hour. SpiceJet calls me a day prior to inform the flight is cancelled and I have to take an alternate flight Goa Delhi Delhi Hyderabad the flight time including lay over is more than 10 hours. I am travelling with 2 kids. Very very bad. Dont prefer SpiceJet.
Flew from Osaka to Los Angeles on 992019 at 525 PM boarding time. The gate agents were very helpful and friendly. Ive never receive such great service from an international airline ever I highly recommend Japanese Airlines and would recommend this airline to any friends or relatives.
Took a day trip to Vienna with British Airways booked at the last minute. Flying out at 0720 on a Sunday and having an early start to get to the airport I was looking forward to getting some sleep on the flight. Having never usually been a problem I boarded the aircraft and asked if it would be possible to get a pillow and blanket to be told by a member of crew that these are not for economy passengers only business. Freezing temperature onboard the aircraft so managed to get limited sleep another example of BAs pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates the nonexistence of customer service within the airline. Despite it being one of the first flights out of Heathrow with no queue for departure and perfect weather conditions we still managed to arrive about 20 minutes late into Vienna quite as to how is beyond me. Ill be sticking to easyJet until British Airways once again starts to value its passengers as currently they couldnt care less.
I have booked tickets for 6 people. 4 hours before the flight take off I received a call from AirAsia customer service that the flight is cancelled due to technical issue. I was asked to take the next day 5 am call. I told them I had already started my commute to airport and try to find an alternate flight for the same day. 10 minutes later I got a call again stating that the technical problem got resolved and I can use the same flight. When I enquired with some of the copassengers to find out whether they received similar call from AirAsia none of them had received calls like that.
Ethiopian Airlines is a disappointing airline. The first flight should not have taken place in the plane we flew in. It was not maintained well. The roof boards were loose. The bathroom was duck taped together. The sink section came out of its socket and was open up. The plane should be taken in for proper maintenance. The food is terrible and Im one who enjoys plane food. The chicken was rubbery and bland. I recommend bringing your own food. The staff barely offer you something to drink and when the staff were told about the damage they did not attend to it. The equipment on the plane is old and some lucky passengers were given earphones and a blanket we had to request these items. The second flight was somehow worse. The flight was overbooked. The food was even worse than the first flight inedible except the bread and cheese. The staff kept the cabin lights on throughout the night so it is impossible to sleep. I requested three times for the cabin lights to be turned off during the dark and I was ignored even though this was possible on the first flight. The seating is uncomfortable and small. This flight ran out of drinkable water. The movies were outdated and it was an unpleasant and long flight. If you travel far I recommend Qatar Airways its more worth the money you pay. I have travelled on many flights with many airlines but I will never fly with Ethiopian Airlines again. I do hope the airline fixes these problems because I do wish the best for them in the future.
There is a list of items that went wrong when we used Silver for a trip from Ft Lauderdale to North Eleuthera. They delayed our flight by over 4 hours. Customer service was nonexistent and it caused us to miss a connecting flight. Checked bags were damaged. The planes are gross. They should clean the planes at least once per day. We paid for front row seats and the attendant made us move to the back of the plane to rebalance. That money was never refunded because there is no customer service. Ill never use Silver Airways again. Only use them if you absolutely have to.
Disappointing flight. A very old Boeing 777 seat configuration 232 in Business. Champagne and wine were nothing special. Food was the worst I had on a flight my beef was overdone vegetables tasteless and cheese had supermarket quality We arrived punctually and the crew was very friendly.
I had the worst experience of my lifetime flying with Emirates. It all started from Thiruvananthapuram where our travel began food was just pathetic and the service is just awful. Let alone the seats are not even comfortable with hardly any legroom. Sitting on the seat for less than an hour and you feel your bones crushing on the frame of the seat. The flight attendants seem like overly busy even if they were to walk past you and you ask them for a glass of water. The next leg was the long haul. Both my wife and I were just exhausted with the service and the flight attendants wouldnt even get a band aid after I cut myself from hitting my feet on the fasteners of the seat. We waited for almost an hr after boarding from Dubai to take off and I ended up cutting myself while being seated and I showed my feet to the flight attendant and she didnt even care to get back to me until my wife had to address it 48 minutes later. The seats are as poor as the first leg. How do you expect customers to sit in these seats for such longhaul flights. No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like its my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why dont you move the other bag instead. She didnt even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasnt full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I dont understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water. They asked if theres anything else like it was a big huge task for them to get a glass of water. Juicewaterfruits
London Heathrow to Vancouver with British Airways. Outbound flight was delayed by 2 hours. Email was received on the day of travel. It did take 2 calls to the airline to establish if one could arrive later. On the first call there was such a poor understanding of the question that the operator thought we wanted to rebook flights. Fortunately we were cut off as I think the call might have continued for the rest of the day. Second call was more successful and a direct answer was given no matter how unwelcome. Printing your own baggage labels was a new experience at LHR I am not a frequent air traveller. A sign of the times perhaps but I did get the impression of going through a self checkout at a supermarket. Not much to say about bag drop off. It was neither efficient nor inefficient just a linear series of a few tasks performed by someone doing their job. The young chap at drop off said that the delay started as 10 minutes at the beginning of the week which had turned into two hours by Friday. At the gate I did wonder why those with priority boarding moved to a different seating area all of 3 metres away. I suspect people need to be seen receiving value for higher ticket prices because they will of course get there first The flight was just about adequate. My video screen did not work and despite requests to 2 cabin crew this was not rectified well I was ignored. Fortunate as the film and TV choice was poor. I do not like airline food that much. There are plenty of food outlets past security to get something decent to eat. Never really drink the wine. Beer and spirits hard to get wrong. Return flight was only made better by the jet stream reducing the flight time by an hour. Again the flight was just about adequate. Did not eat the food as I had a salad from an outlet at YVR good value. Flight attendant said it looked better than what they were serving. The seat in front of me was broken so it reclined further than it should. The only solution provided by another attendant was to get up walk around a bit and stand at the back. Whilst the broken seat was not the fault of the passenger in front she did not want to be reasonable. The attendant stood there waiting for me to derive a solution.
Beijing to Pyongyang and return and could enjoy the new Tupolev planes of Air Koryo. The business class is very small 8 seats but comfortable with good seats. Stewardesses attentive entertainment is miserable and so is the food. Anyhow the Tupolevs bring a huge improvement to the image of Air Koryo.
Amsterdam to Lima via Paris CDG. The airplane is what you would expect of it little legroom but price on the flight is low so that is okay. What bothered me are the stewards on this flight. It was a 12h flight with almost no service there was a 10hour time window without service drinksfood whatsoever. The stewards looked as if they felt too good to be serving other people and for any food or drinks you would have to walk to the back of the plane. They were not helpful until personally approached with a question. During the flight they were just talking with each other in the back of the plane they were not too busy to help. Normally I dont write reviews about airlines especially not about budget airlines because that is what you get for the low price but this is unacceptable.
We had Qatar Airways business class flights for December 2016 booked in early May from Munich to Auckland via Doha which were also confirmed. In May 2016 we found out that the flights were canceled allegedly because the route was cancelled due to delivery difficulties of the A350 and thus the Boeing 777200LR is used on other routes. The GermanPolish Qatar Airways Call Center offered generous manner either to refund our ticket or to move the trip to February which is not possible however because the lodges are already booked for the tour in New Zealand and not may be canceled. A flight to Sydney and then a connecting flight to Auckland was declined by Qatar Airways because obviously the One World partner Qantas no longer operates since 17052016 with Qatar together. Thus Qatar Airways does not even follow its own conditions of carriage and does not substitute transportation Such poor service I have not yet seen.
Travelling with my 83 Years Semi disabled Mother Booked tickets 2 months in advance requested disabled person to aircraft assistance. Ist Rize Flight Checked in two hours prior to departure Headed to the special assistance desk to be told that they had a long line of waiting which if we were to wait we would miss our flight The supervisor suggested for us to walk through security and catch the buggy service which was easily available Even though this was very painful task for my older Mother we did as we were advised only to be told at the buggy company desk which was far further from the security that their service was chargeable as they are a private company We had no choice but to pay the EURO 10.00 to get to the gate ONLY NOT to the aircraft as we requested booked two months ago Rize IST flight Checked in at the business class separate lounge I told the hopeless only agent that we booked the special assistance and needed the car lift to up to the aircraft as Mum cannot walk the stairs as the airport has no air bridge at all She replied confirming that all was in order When we tried to board We were told by the SAME agent that she could not get the car lift and that we had to walk up the stairs I asked for her manger to attend He told me that I did not request the assistance I had to show him the original confirmation email then we got the car lift to the aircraft. Arrived IST Wheelchair agent was waiting for us as we disembarked HOORAY the agent assisted us through the jet bridge left us by the seats at the gate claiming that another agent meant to assist us the very long way to the baggage hall Guess what NO ONE showed up for 40 minutes and no one was available to assist Be warned Turkish Airlines do not provide disabled assistance even if booked and their staff are liars.
Sofia to Lisbon. This four hour flight felt like an eternity. Legroom was better than on their A320s but still insufficient. I emptied the pocket in front of my so there would be more space available. Food was good but not enough. There are no pillows on Bulgaria Air. Landed on time.
Karachi to New York JFK via Istanbul. It was my first time experiencing with Turkish Airline. I bought 3 tickets and for most part this airline is rather cheaper than its competitors such as Emirates and Qatar. However you do pay a price with horrible customer service and in flight food menu. Their customers service representatives provide nearly no accurate information. Staff wont be very polite and if you lose baggage you are pretty much on your own. Makeover it is really challenging to understand the English language of their representatives over the phone.
Cordoba to El Calafate via Buenos Aires. The worst kind of service I could expect from an airline. We were on a flight from Cordoba to El Calafate via Buenos Aires with a one hour layover in Buenos Aires. First our original flight from Cordoba got canceled airlines fault and we were put on a flight which was 40 mins later. This wouldve meant us missing out on our connection. But when we landed our connecting flight also got delayed by 50 mins. Now the ground staff still refuses to check us in on our original connection with atleast an hour to spare for our original flight to depart. I dont think I will ever fly Aerolineas Argentinas again.
Delhi to Singapore. The second time I flew on the A380. The ambiance inside the plane was spacious and great. The service was exceptional. The only things that bothered me on this particular flight was they lacked international food to serve that I was served Indian food which Im not used to. Another hitch was the online checkin where I was not able to choose the seat that I wanted as it was automatically chosen so I was put in an exit row which was a hassle for me as the TV monitor and the tray table has to be set up after take off only. Thank you.
I had a pleasantly smooth flight. Service was excellent plane spotless plenty of sparkling wine to keep me company during my flight from Turin to Munich I wish they flew out of London as well as I would go out of my way to use this company.
Skymark Airlines has some serious issues with the call centre. It is impossible to reach an agent and any attempts to do so are met with having to allow the phone to ring more than 30 times to then listen to a recording to tell you to call back or be prepared to be put on hold to then be put on hold for up to 20 minutes to then be automatically disconnected if an agent does not take your call before the time limit is up. Very frustrating and the money saved is little compensation for the time spent in trying to reach an agent. Once an agent actually does answer the phone they are little more help than an automated computer that only would follow simple requests. This airline company would do much better to hire some staff to be able to think outside of the box.
London to Mumbai. I have had my battles with the leadership at BA because they would not let me book my seat and pay with their Airmiles. Now they have finally relented and this will please many who earn Airmiles through their credit cards. This is just to illustrate that I boarded BA199 with a slightly negative mindset a mindset which was changed quickly. Although I travelled Economy the seat was comfortable the service excellent as was the food. If I have a minor quibble the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old. Is this BAs attempt to reduce costs because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product. I was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any singleuse plastic e.g. water bottles dutyfree carrier bags into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine. Having been grumpy about several aspects of BAs service in the past I will be writing to the leadership to thank them for the improvements.
I was on a short hop from Kiev to Moscow. They called it discount class flight. The price tag was well over what Aeroflot and other legacy carriers asked but I needed to be late night at Domodedovo so bought it. The check in was polite but was informed about recent hand baggage rules change they demanded to pack my backpack into a hold bag and to proceed to a plane with laptop bag only. When onboard was shocked with the seat pitch. Ryanair looks generous after that overcrowded accommodation. You have literally no room to seat plus passengers can recline leaving you no room even to move. The snack service was pathetic with peace of bread in plastic. Crew were polite but not up to other airlines standards. The plane was old. The toilet was smelly. Deplaning in Moscow was via bus. I used to be their loyalty program active user so accumulated some miles. Trying to used them I was unable to book reward ticket via website. This option leads you to a error message on the payment page. Overall overpriced and substandard. Not recommended.
Checked in at Bergen for flight Oslo with SAS connecting to Dubai with Emirates. Arrived early. Waited at gate in Oslo before flight started to board and was 2nd in line. Bags were checked all the way through to Dubai where we would then have a rest and get a flight to Melbourne the following day. Attempted to board and told our tickets had been cancelled by us Somehow in the air from Bergen we decided to cancel our own tickets and delay seeing our 4 children and give up a weekend in Dubai seems unlikely. Argued the point but no interest in listening to us and the flight left without us. We were not told where to go who to contact how to get any help and we had to wait for hours for our luggage to be returned to us after it was taken off the plane. We spent two days stranded in Oslo airport with no help from Emirates at all. Our travel agent confirmed that it was in fact Emirates that cancelled our tickets for being a no show which is 100 wrong and we can prove this. We spent money on hotel footed and lost money in Dubai from prebooked accommodation. Emirates would not give us anything in compensation. Flight home was empty half full. No offer of upgrade or anything at all from customer service or lack of customer service. After a terrible flight home straight through to Melbourne we were now a day late due to the airline. We lost a days work and had to reschedule deliveries at additional cost to our business. After several attempts to write email and call emirates customer service on return to Melbourne we have had zero response The lack of service and care for customers is disgraceful. I was prepandemic a frequent international flyer and in 20 years I have never seen such a poor display. I will never fly this airline again. Emirates is an appalling company that cares nothing for the customer experience. They do not care for Australian passengers its all about looking after their own profits. Fly at your own risk as they will cost you money and care less. Oh actually they did offer us a special treat from business class how could I forget they asked if we wanted a cappuccino from a machine. I dont drink coffee.
London to Johannesburg with British Airways. BAs B gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the Galleries Lounges in the main terminal. Its also a tad closer on the transit or via the rather useful walkway on level 4 to the C gates where the A380s depart from. The new boarding by groups meant snaking queues but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily. The Club World were still the same much maligned seats with the small unresponsive IFE screens and limited selection of films. The dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat. Trolleys may lack glamour but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight. Breakfast was adequate but nothing more. Landing was exactly on time. Overall a reasonable flight but the inflight service was distinctly average.
Martinair Economy Class TorontoAmsterdam. Both flights delayed for more than 4 hours. In Amsterdam Martinair offered a cup of coffee in Toronto nothing was offered. The captain told on both flights they encountered technical problems which was the reason for the delays. Cabin crew service is OK but seats are too small in Economy Class. Overall due to the ongoing delay problems and the poor service at the service desk I will not fly Martinair again.
Scoot lost my luggage. Im told they left it behind in Singapore where I was in transit for 4 hours was also told on arrival at Sydney airport that it would be on the next available flight and I would get it back within 2448 hours. Today is the 18th day since those assurances and promises were made I have received nothing but automated replies the first few days and zero response since. Frustrated at not being able to deal with a real person I returned to the airport to chase up at the lost luggage counter after 7 days and I was told no they never sent it back from Changi Airport. They said they would send a followup email to Singapore but if I wanted updates I would again have to call up their support line. And as you guessed their support line isnt manned it drops out when you try to call and my emails to their support inbox bounce back undeliverable because their inbox is full.
I am appalled by their lack of customer service. I purchased an Air New Zealand flight through Edreams back in May 2021. The flight unfortunately had to be cancelled due to border entry restrictions due to the covid outbreak. I have from July last year to present day been fighting to get my money back all 1900 euros of it I contacted Edreams they tell me they are waiting for the refund from Air NZ I contact Air NZ they tell me Edreams holds my money I now have an email proof from Edreams to say that they are still awaiting a refund from Air NZ which I have now sent to the customer service department but I doubt I will get any answers because they blatantly ignore all emails I send If you are selling your flights through a scam company then you are just as much responsible for fighting our case because the flight your companies flight was booked in good faith and the matter of the refund needs to be sorted Do NOT ignore your customers
The new Embraer fleet is excellent 2x2 leather seating. Staff helpful so far every flight has been on time and City Airport is brilliant. I checked in for my flight to Zurich last week 12 minutes before the flight and they still let me on. Noticed the pilots have made a point of the fact that Cityflyer is not mainline BA therefore theyre not subject to the strike action so Ive been booking upcoming trips with them with confidence.
Travelled to Lanzarote from Dublin return and was extremely impressed. Both flights left on time and the staff were helpful and courteous.
I flew Kulula from Johannesburg to East London return. I dont think I have ever been so uncomfortable on an aircraft and I have flown on numerous low cost airlines before. The seating is dreadful. The crew on the outbound flight were not too friendly but a lot better on the return. I would not recommend Kulula due to the seating. They could remove one row to try to be a little more competitive.
Moscow to Prague. This was a very poor experience. Initially I changed my ticket after buying one with baggage extra. Then I changed the date. The system did not took my baggage although I emailed the company twice and they assured me this was ok. I had to pay again for the baggage. The departure was delayed from 505 to 545 to 630 and still counting. Missing first night events in Prague due to this flight. A horrible experience.
I used this airline the first time for a long distance trip it consisted of a 15h flight with one stopover on a small island before reaching the destination some 2h flight apart. on the way in the aircraft changed route because of a medical emergency onboard. This resulted in a 4h delay and the cancellation of the trip to our final destination. the problem is that the English speaking passengers were never informed they were in an airport with little to no English speaking personnel at night try to figure out which way to go. On the way back after checking in and spending a morning waiting we finally realized that the flight was cancelled and that we had to go to the airline box to find out what next In a nutshell two out of 5 working days wasted connection flight arrangements wasted without compensation and much of our plans ruined as due to the lack of feedback we had little time to try and fix things. This was the worst ever trip I had. To top it up when we disembarked for the last time ever from the corsair craft we collected our luggage completely drenched in a foul smelling liquid so much that the contents needed to be washed several times. thank god there were only casual garments in the case.
First off this particular flight from EWR to LHR and back was advertised as a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The actual jet was a 777 much less comfortable. The flight going to London was 3 hours delayed coming into EWR something about a diversion regarding a sick passenger in Boston MA. In fact they had not allocated a crew. Coming home my prepaid seats were changed in premium economy to seats next to WCs so I had the pleasure of smelling excretion and gas the whole flight. I was also emailed an offer for an upgrade then that email was followed up with one that stated that the first one was sent in error. Fact I did get back to the USA. Reality BA no more never again. The problem with BA is not their cabin crews who are quite nice. The problem is that their Customer service is a joke. Cannot recommend this airline.
I arrived early for my scheduled flight Kochi to Srinagar via Mumbai. It was scheduled at 1030am but I landed at Mumbai 1030. Due to that I couldnt board my flight. The airline clearly knows the landing time and Im going to miss my connection flight but I have not received any single call regarding this even your staff could have inform me during checking. I visited the help desk for the issue they said no more flights for today and tomorrows flights also cancelled. Next day I booked indigo flight to the destination from my pocket. Go Air is worst airline they treat their passengers like fools.
Toronto to Copenhagen via Keflavik. Rates were very cheap I paid for a little extra leg room still cheaper than the competition. Staff service was excellent friendliest crew Ive met yet. There are luggage requirements that must be met or you pay for extra baggage do your homework and measure your luggage no issues here. Meals are not included in the price of the ticket but food is available in flight at a reasonable price.
My journey began in San Diego with a limo bus to LAX. Nearly everybody in the limo seemed to be travelling on Turkish and to beyond Istanbul. The driver said all their services are full of passengers for THY. If you are listening Turkish Airlines think about a few flights to San Diego with its upcoming new terminal Checkin was open very early and painless by a very polite agent. Boarding was chaotic. The first boarding announcement began half way through another announcement about another flight being made throughout the terminal. The agent spoke with her back to the boarding gates and said which passenger groups to wait on the left and which on the right. But it transpired she meant on our left and right even though she indicated her left and right. Consequently the lines were totally full of the wrong passengers. Eventually we found the right lines and entered through the boarding gates which also took our photos in the process. Apart from the boarding mixup I would say the process in LAX was very good. After boarding the Captain announced 20 minutes delay in startup due to some luggage compartment problems. My seat was near the back and I could hear loud noises of containers rumbling around. But she was exactly right and after 20 minutes we started up and took off. Amenity packs and Menus were distributed followed by the first meal. The crew on this flight were very relaxed and courteous as they served us. On my way out from Istanbul I had been in Business Class but the crew there all seemed in a rush even though the flight was over twelve hours. Everybody settled down to sleep as the sun could be seen coming up and then setting again through a few open window shades. A selfservice snack and drinks were available in the galleys during the night. Near the end of the flight another hot meal with choice of entree was served. We landed on time and endured the inevitable long ground time at Istanbul Airport before we reached our gate. Long long walks to Immigration and another long walk to the most distant luggage carousel even though there were many empty ones near the centre of Arrivals. But. Our luggage was already going round Istanbul Airport luggage is always so fast. Overall an excellent flight.
BA flight 8005 from Orly to JFK. 9152014. Planes are old and shabby and not enough restrooms. Seat was broken and did not recline at all cabin crew unapologetic and said it happens all the time unacceptable. Disorganized at Orly checkin and security. British Airways needs to get their act together with this product. I do not recommend.
I flew out LHRDXB on economy and was upgraded to business for the return flight. Economy was not too busy so had middle seat free. Checkin was fine and meal quality for economy was pretty good. ICE had a big choice. Flight left a bit late but caught up. 30 minute wait to get my bag at DXB. Return flight checkin took forever not enough attendants but getting upgraded to business certainly made up for it. I travelled business on Emirates about 4 years ago and seat configuration has improved and having access to the standup bar was great. if I had been paying for business I would have been a bit miffed that my first choice of steak had already gone by the time I was asked. My first course of arabic mezze was served with a choice of breads but no arabic wrapsbreads which would have been a far better accompaniment.Main course of seafood biriani was prawns hidden in a flavoured rice pleasant but nothing remarkable and a bit dry. Pudding of Mango millefeuille was excellent. Choice of wines was fine. Arrival at LGW was on time and luggage came out quickly but given it was North Terminal we had a 15 minute walk to get there.
Premium Plus direct from Newark to Paris rt. Not only was the customer service horrible they didnt have my seat after I booked it 6 months ahead. The plane we took was run down old not fresh nor charming with poor lighting etc. Bathrooms were dirty. The food was poor. The attendants barely offered even water during the flight. Thats if you could find them. The lounge is no longer available unless youre a silvergold member. It used to be available to all premium plus seats and first class.
Manila to Zurich I checked in online and been given the boarding passes from Manila to Doha from Doha to Zurich with both seati numbers displayed. Landed in Doha I had to wait 3hrs at the respective gate. On my boarding pass I had zone 4 which is I think the last zone. When scanning my boarding pass it showed seating issues and I had to see staff who said that Economy is overbooked. I was in shock and asked what that means for me. He replied flight is full you you need to go to Customer Service. And I asked politely why there is a seating number and why I was even been checked in if the flight is full I asked if he could please check once everyone is on board if there is still capacity in any the plane I stood there and asked if he could recheck. In the end there was one space left and I could fly but I received my luggage only the day after.
AthensLimnos on a Q400. Check in quick and efficient. Boarding by bus but quite efficient too. The flight left five minutes early and arrived 15 minutes early. It was smooth and the friendly crew worked very hard to get everyone a drink and nuts on this 40min flight. There was ample leg room. A good experience.
Never heard of this airline until I flew in July on Embraer 190 from Tianjin to Ningbo but impressed by service standards. At the airport the check in and boarding was quick and efficient and FAs were very attentive. Okay their English language skills need improving but never seen such an efficient and smiling set of FAs. Seats comfortable for this quite short trip meals was also good lack of newspapers though. Will fly them again in September and woulkd have no doubts about recommending them to others as a musttry airline.
Venice to Gatwick. Problems encountered on 24th July at Venice Marco Polo airport as a result of cancellation of flight BA2581 back to Gatwick. From various conversations that took place it would appear that there were no British Airways staff at Venice Marco Polo airport everything is handled by the local service agents. Obviously many of the problems are as a result of mishandling by the local service agents they need to be made aware and retrained if necessary as no doubt BA are paying them money to carry out their duties. Announcements were unclear especially in the lounge the departure board information did not help. After arriving at 1300 we were eventually taken by bus to a hotel almost 1 hour away arriving at 2400. The following day on the replacement flight we were taxiing out and a flightdeck hold warning light came on creating further delays while that was fixed. I am all for safe flying but BA need to improve their standards.
We waited in the checkin line for 1.5 hours. I have used the same carryon for six years and this was the first time on any airline that it was too big 50 fee. All five family members were seated alone including my nineyearold.
Manchester to Dubai return. EK18 on 17th April 2019 was great staff were friendly and helpful food good everything nice. Great first impressions of the airline. Flight EK19 back to Manchester on 24th April 2019 not so good. Family to our right let their 3 or 4 year old daughter play in the aisle for approx 5 of the 7 hours flight she was jumping up and down banging on the floor swinging on seats hit my son and staff never said a word at any point even though she was constantly in their wayplaying next to other passengers further down the plane even when they were eating. The father was sat on the aisle seat but made not 1 single attempt to control his daughter he looked like everything was an effort except eating the extra meals he asked for and got and instead put his headphones onsnoozed whilst his daughter roamed about in between asking staff for things out of sequence instead of waiting to be served like the rest of us. Was disappointed with the lack of staff response it ruined our flight. The man had an air of entitlement for some reason even though his family had 3 seats so in a way us families next to him with 4 seats had paid more to be there yet got a worse service I know it doesnt work like that but it is annoying when 1 passenger thinks they are above everyone else. To make it worse a man had been moved from his rightful seat to accommodate the family in those seats they had missed their earlier flight so were put on this one instead which was annoying in hindsight we would all have had a nice flight in zone D if the original man seated there had not been forced to move. I also paid for extra wifi on both journeys and then it didnt work Waste of 20 My Emirates experience was 1010 on the way there and then reduced to 410 on the way back.
Not recommended if its a transit flight. There is a lot of gate changes you could miss your flight and they will make you pay for another ticket. Bahrain airport is a small and bad one.
Flew from Da Nang via Ho Chi Minh Melbourne 200320. This flight was sold as a full Service flight however when we got on the plane we were told there was no alcohol being served due to covid 19 I then asked about other drinks juice tea coffee they said no only water for the whole long haul flight I was never informed this by email or at check in that the flight service was changing we were never given a choice to refund or offered any compensation. They did feed us but the food was very very bad. Pasta salad a main of again pasta bread. No veg no fruit. Breakfast was you guessed it pasta noodles with meat there was no choice if you were vegetarian and a terrible baby food type of custard which was absolutely disgusting no coffee no tea. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable also and the plane was completely full but they had seats in business and first and did not bother to upgrade anyone even if requested. Also in the first instance they were not even going to let me board as they told me I could not transit through Australia and I did not have visa I am from NZ and was allowed to do so I finally called embassies in Vietnam NZ and Australia after waiting more than an hour in Da Nang and then also Ho Chi Minh. Eventually I called border force myself in Melbourne who said of course I could come and I had to hand over phone to Vietnam Airlines check in staff so they would finally allow me to check in. Terrible service. If I could give no stars I would
Dubai to Islamabad. Excellent airport services. Seats are very comfortable excellent entertainment system. The only drawback was the food which was not as per menu and I did not get the full menu. The flight departed and arrived on time. I would recommend Emirates.
Entebbe to London via Kigali. I can thoroughly recommend this airline. The service is as good as or in many cases better than any major airline with cabin crew who are courteous helpful and attentive with good quality food and beverages. The aircraft are new and the cabins are spotless. The seating in business class offers lay flat beds and they offer Premium Economy cabin. I travel a lot in Africa and even if there are quicker options I prefer to take this airline. Punctuality is good and in flight service even on short flights is excellent. The let downs are the appallingly slow security check at Kigali which can take an hour which causes delays to flights at busy times. This is a problem required to be addressed. Also they could do with a wider choice of films on the entertainment system.
Austrian Airlines lost my luggage on 15th August and on 3 Sept we were delayed my nearly 2 hours. Terrible service. They have gone down a lot this summer. I would not recommend them.
The Qantas aircraft on the shorter legs only approximately 8 hours between Brisbane and Singapore was an A330. We had no complaints about the seats or the service provided on this flight. It was a entirely different story on the longer 14 hours legs between London and Singapore on their supposedly prestigious QF1 and QF2 route. The A380 seating was of the standard you might experience on short haul budget airlines. Uncomfortable no legroom flimsy construction with the reclining position difficult to control. With the seats in the fully reclined position which was most of the time on these overnight flights it was very difficult to get in and out of your seat. It would appear that Qantas have packed the maximum number of rows of seats into the A380 to generate maximum revenue with no thought to the comfort and well being of the passengers. I certainly will not be flying with Qantas again.
Chicago OHare to London Heathrow on 2 May. check in very fast and efficient. New 777 plane. Take off and landing about 30 minutes late. Friendly flight crew. Efficient service. Good vegetarian meal. Very pleasant flight.
Khon Kaen to Bangkok Don Muang. Thai AirAsia provides good quality for the money though there are minor points of criticism. I bought their premium flex package which gave me the option to choose my seat 1C a meal even though the flight took only 55 minutes plus water 20 kg luggage and express luggage and boarding. The flight attendants were polite but a bit too reserved to my taste. The seat was a bit too narrow and the meal lasagna too bland. Boarding was fast with a separate check in for those with a premium package thus hardly any waiting time. My luggage came almost as first so they were true to their promise. For short flights as mine I think this airline is a good choice.
Brisbane to Taipei. Originally I was booked on EVA Air but about a week before my flight in late June 2019 they went on strike with a number of flights cancelled and I was changed to this flight about a week before my departure. EVA operates an A330 with 222 in business class on this route but China Airlines operates an A350900 with a 121 and what a stunning cabin this is probably the nicest business class cabin I have travelled. With a late departure around 2250 from Brisbane and an arrival into Taipei at 0545 the next morning with just under 9 hours in the air the quick meal service on departure was well organized and excellent quality which left a reasonable amount of time for some sleep before breakfast before arrival in Taipei. The seat on this plane is fantastic with plenty of storage a great screen and a very sturdy table that pulls out from under the screen and always have a little part exposed so is always a handy shelf at anytime. The finishes that they have used seem to be of a really high quality with my 16 month old plane looking like it was on its first flight. No pyjamas are provided but slippers and a nice amenity kit are.
StarFlyer is by far the best lowcost airline I have used anywhere. Price was low about half of what Shinkansen bullet train would have been and included luggage. On board the plane you have stylish leather seats with IFE and good legroom. Drinks are also included in the price and flight attendants made sure everything is ok and in general were very friendly. Ryanair and Easyjet should learn from them in fact StarFlyer is better than many full service airlines
London to San Francisco with British Airways was a pleasant experience. We left with a slight delay due to the traffic at Heathrow although boarded on time but landed almost on time. We flew an A380 and my seat was somewhere in the back on the upper deck. Enough legroom entertainment system personalized and very easy to use. Although it was a dayflight we got additional to the usual blanket and pillow a small toothbrush and paste. The food was good served 2 times plus snack and so was the Spanish wine they gave us. I enjoyed the complementary drinks alcoholic or nonalcoholic. The crew were nice and polite and careful with our needs. Some of them were even wearing Santa Claus hats making Christmas feel like home. I would fly them again not only for the tea they serve.
This is the second time Ive flown Firefly. Great little airline with friendly flight attendants. The cabin was very clean and the flight deck crew kept us well informed. The ticket prices are cheaper if you book on their website.
Phuket to Bangkok. They charged me 170 US dollars for my bag because it was in the fine print that a bag was not included. This was more than the cost of the flight. Once I was on the plane I put my bag in my overhead compartment as I was in an emergency row turned my devices off and went to sleep. I was woken up 3 times by flight attendants asking me to put my seat up straight while it was already all the way up making it clear that the drinks were there and asking me if my bag was under my seat it is not because I put it in my overhead bin like you told me.
Do you believe that after completing the online checkin process we still need to stand in line for 2 hours in the airport to get your boarding passes. The airport staff from Etihad Airways are the worst i have ever seen. Inside the flight they refuse to provide hot water to feed the milk to children we need to beg them for hot water 2 to 3 times if the child cries they will ask you to take them to Restroom for calming. The Veg food Cucumber salad provided in the 13 hour flight IAD to AUH was stale and greasy. I wont book Etihad again.
We recently travelled as a family of 5 from Melbourne to Paris and London Return Perth Mauritius Paris London Mauritius Perth on Air Mauritius. We found the airline to be no frills and got us from A to B efficiently. My complaints are the economy class seats on the older Airbus A340300s operating from London and Paris to Mauritius were worn uncomfortable and had a terrible entertainment system I struggled to sleep the whole 12 hours. The newer Airbus A330200s operating the Mauritius to Perth route was more comfortable and had a better newer entertainment system though the particular flight we were on was packed full and quite uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight. The cabin crew did their job but did not go out of their way to offer any additional service. The food service onboard depended on which route you fly on the Parisian route we got a decent curry dinner and a refreshing French breakfast but on the Perth flight we only received a bland meal at about midnight and a horrible hot vegetable substance in a bread roll for arrival when all we felt like having something refreshing I noticed a large majority of people did not eat it. In the end it was an ok airline and would recommend it if you are stopping over in Mauritius.
Flight from Genoa to Munich was very pleasant. Excellent snacks and an overall atmosphere of relaxation throughout the flight. Lots of legroom. Nice plane a little on the noisy side.
Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. The only trouble was at boarding where despite having checked in online and told to go straight to the gate I was held up for document check and have a paper boarding pass printed. Plane departed on time and arrived 20 minutes early. Plenty of empty seats made for a comfortable flight though aircon was a bit too cold.
Mumbai to Goa. Did my checkin and proceeded to security check only to be told that I have an Allen Key in my back pack which is not allowed in hand baggage and will have to be put into the checked baggage which was not told to me at the time of checkin. So i went back to the checkin counter to get some help and assistance. I relayed the incident to theservice rep and told him that since my bags are already checked i would like to check my hand bag. He turns round to tell me that if I check the hand bag I will be over my baggage allowance and will have to pay excess baggage. Clearly the man doesnt know anything about the meaning of service. Instead of helping me out or finding a solution he wanted me to pay for their mistake of not informing me that the Allen key was not allowed on board. I had to leave the Allen Keys at the check in counter because if I asked them to bring my bags back I would have missed the flight which Im sure they wouldve put down to me as well.
What a splendid surprise. airBaltic has leased plenty of aircrafts for summer 2023. First leg was Cyprus Airways. Old plane and the cabin attendants looked like suffering from the work. Oh take me back to warm Cyprus. Last leg by Carpatair. First class service with smiles and a new aircraft. I am now giving 10 points because theres was absolutely something extra ordinary offered by AirBaltic. Otherwise youre normally just sitting bored at the plane at least in economy class.
I booked a flight from Bahrain to Faisalabad about a month ago. I reached the airport on the day of flight. To my shock they informed me and about 50 other passengers that the aircraft was already full. They made us wait for hours without any explanation. If someone shouted at their unprofessional behaviour they shouted back. Later the staff offered two difficult options either to go to Islamabad instead of Faisalabad with the next flight or to wait for another few hours to get a new ticket for a flight to Faisalabad two days later. I had already spent hours at the airport in this frustration I chose to go to Islamabad. It took me hours of extreme trouble to reach from Islamabad to Faisalabad all because of this nonsense done by Gulf Air. They are extremely arrogant people very unprofessional rude to the passengers and untrustworthy. They offer no explanation no compensation for changing the tickets and no sympathy to the poor passengers who made the mistake of booking with them.
Traveled Air Canada rouge from Bridgetown to Toronto and back to BGI. To YYZ was not bad as there was just a slight delay. On the way back to BGI the staff was not understanding as I was traveling with medication and the scales were off as I had to use 2 different scales that gave different weights and I had to move around items and was advised I would have to pay 100 cad for 1lb of overweight. The staff were rude and very nonchalant about it. I requested fragile stickers for my luggage my luggage was brand new and there were a few items in my luggage that could break. When I received my luggage a it was dented and a wheel was off. Im quite appalled by the service received as ticket price were extremely expensive seeing the space given for seating and no entertainment having to pay for wifi and even water.
Flown with British Airways on numerous occasions with no issues. However on this occasion my baggage was lost on arrival at Gatwick. There was no British airways representative at the baggage claim however there was a phone that allowed me to call the baggage department. Reclaiming lost baggage was simple and my bag was put on the next flight to Singapore which I received the following day.
The worst airline I have ever flown with. I am used to budget airlines and no amenity travel so that is not the issue here. Although it was the most budget airline I have flown the plane smelled terrible and there were old stickers all over the plane as if it was tagged. My first flight they delayed the flight by over an hour right before boarding. Odd but ok. My second flight they canceled the flight 45 minutes after their customer service number was closed. They asked me to fill out a form online in regard to my canceled flight. I did so and also called at 8 am the next day and didnt get a representative on the phone until 5 pm. I was stuck in the city. Their website says that they cover amenities if the flight is delayed longer than 4 hours and a hotel room up to 100 if it is delayed or canceled overnight. I had paid 50 for a change fee for this flight. So when I finally got in the phone with a representative I was told that the couldnt refund the change fee they didnt know what amenities were covered and it would take 30 business days to get back to me and that they could only issue a refund of 12 the price of the flight. I am still going back and forth with customer service because I was supposed to get an email that I could reply to directly for concerns and updates and I never received it. The average hold time for calling their center is 5 hours. I will never ever fly this airline again.
Hong Kong to Dubai. I was sitting in 42C originally sitting on 42B but changed seats by someone else on the aisle. The flight was really full that it was trying to get all travelers from Hong Kong and nearby cities to Dubai. The boarding gate was fair that I need to take the train to my boarding gate. Cabin crew were nice and ready to help us. The meal selection included either Chicken or Beef which I chose the Chicken with pasta which I think the taste is fair not really good at all. I had ordered their cup noodles as well but it was neither taste well . The ICE flight entertainment is really good however the hardware was not so adapted into it. The plane was quite old and they use the setup which years ago does. I could understand with that but I think its time to get some renovation on that plane which they could change to the setup on their Boeing 777300ER. After some time of sleep the snack came with Beef sandwich with drinks. Even though the sandwich was dry it tastes better than the dinner. Before the flight landed some travelers attempted to change seat even though the belt sign was on for a while the cabin crew had to yell to stop them but those travelers changed anyway. The flight arrive Dubai almost an hour earlier than expected. Hope next time I will have better experience on this flight.
EDILCY return in one day. I was expecting delays and various other bumps along the way as it was the height of the London Olympic games but everything went smoothly. Edinburgh airport is run well with the exception of beings bussed to the E190. Onboard the aircraft was clean bright and modern. Inflight service included a round of drinks and a light snack which is more that sufficient for an hour and 15 minute flight. The return flight that evening was just as good. This time a short walk across the apron to our E170 and onboard again clean and comfortable. Inflight service of drinks and warm snacks suitable for the evening shuttle. I was lucky in having Row 01 seats on both legs so amply leg room.
It was the worst trip I made overseas Booked ticket on Qatar website and on return the luggage from DEL didnt arrive at Doha. The rude staff did not allow me to board flight to DFW After debating with them that the booking was done by Qatar Airways and any connecting flight was their responsibility I was finally made to stay overnight. Next day reached DFW and again the flight to my destination was cancelled They flew me to an airport 2.5 hr away and husband had to drive 5 hr to pick me up. No amount of phone support would help. Very rude staff at Doha making you feel as if it was my fault the luggage didnt arrive. They need better logistics with partner airlines. I trusted Middle East airlines over American but its a mistake. Time tested Delta and American are still dependable. A 25 hr journey took 45h.
Joberg to George return. On both flights the two stewardesses were friendly and helpful. The seat was comfortable the light snack in a box far better than a lot of others Ive had on larger airlines. Very fresh well filled roll chocolate bar and little biscuit plus soft drinks or coffeetea. Im pretty sure there were other drinks but I wasnt really paying attention Outbound flight was a few minutes early arriving the inbound 20 minutes early As we were all on board the pilot took off then and there great We were able to check in our luggage from George to LHR with no problem great bonus not having to drag it from one terminal to another at Joberg. Very friendly check in lady at George. Very happy with all aspects of our flights.
JERGCIJERLCY. Interisland flights on a little Jetstream. Only 10 mins each way but good fun. With the open cabin and no door to the flight deck it really gave an insight into what the flight crew do. Far from transcontinental business class that I often fly but in many ways this was a lot more enjoyable. The lounges for all passengers are a nice touch but some air con in Jersey would be good. Timetable seems to not be completely thought through for connections eg 1hr 30 wait in Jersey for flight to LCY. Would like to see a GCILCY direct flight added or better connections to the JERLCY flight so that a LCYGCI trip can be done in a day. All in all though a very good experience that I would happily repeat.
My flight was very good very smooth landing it was via Istanbul which is a beautiful airport. The A320200 seats annoyed me bit not a lot of legroom no IFE but the B737800 or B737900Er is the complete opposite. The B737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 theyre too good
Return British Airways flight from Heathrow to Las Vegas. The cabin crew were very good helpful and friendly. However the quality of the seatback screens and the seats are very tired and very oudated. The films and tv shows are good however the quality of the screen is poor compared to other airlines. The seats are also well past their serviceable life. Other airlines offer far better seats and entertainment so it is rather disappointing British Airways dont. Even other newer BA planes have far superior seats and VOD to which it is shocking the difference in the service offered for economy class there isnt even a charging port in the Boeing 747 when there is on the newer planes. At least the meals were good.
The incoming plane arrived one hour late but despite that they managed to leave on time. The aircraft was new and the service from the flight crew was great...nothing to fault. The meal quality was impeccable and they have decent selection of non alcoholic drinks I cannot drink for medical reasons. One of the best flights overall. But the experience was trashed by the arrival in Doha as the aircraft got a parking space in the middle of nowhere followed by a 45 minute bus ride to the terminal.
Flew from Tashkent to Moscow then to New York. The breakfast omelette was like a piece of rubber and tasted awful. The other meals were no better. The crew on the other hand was great with one exception. The TV screen did not function at all but I slept most of the way anyway.
I booked a flight last September from Bangkok to Amsterdam in April 2023. Everything was ok until i got a message last night that my first flight was rescheduled to a week later while the other flights were on the date of departure. I tried to contact the airline but they only have a bot reacting and told me to contact them by phone. After I called the employee told me to change my booking on the website. There were no other flights available so I contacted the airline again and they told me they couldnt help me if there were no other flights available. I asked them how they can reschedule the first flight and not change the rest of the flights. They couldnt help me with anything. Terrible customer service and I wouldnt recommend this airline to fly with. This was my first and last booking with this airline. I had to book a new flight with another airline and getting my money back is also a hustle.
We went to Canberra for a funeral and on the flight back we had such a great steward Johno such a happy person with a great personality making everyone feel so welcome. Nothing was a problem even though it was a short flight he was the best see you again Qantas
Beijing to Hong Kong. Ticket quite cheap comparing to an average of HK2500 this was only HK1000. New aircraft. Check in at PEK is fast but boarding is a little messy. Cabin crew and service is good they may also accept flight logs. Meal was nasty as usual since air cater was done in PEK.
Bangalore to Kathmandu. One of the worst airlines if you consider on time performance. They are usually never on time. On time is word which is not in their dictionary. They do not provide information about the delay on their website and surprisingly other flight tracking websites also do not reflect the actual time of this airline. Prepare to get delayed by 23 hours under normal circumstances. I have traveled Nepal Airlines more than 30 times and maybe once it was on time yes I was surprised.
Hong Kong to Shanghai with Dragonair and a fantastic experience. I would say its much better than its parent company Cathay Pacific. Cabin attendants were present throughout the cabin with warm and friendly smile. Flight delayed for a bit which I think its normal due to the heavily congested Chinese airspace. A varieties of beverages and 2 choices of hot meal were handed out. Icecream afterwards The meal in economy class is one of the best Ive had A superb airline with excellent cabin service.
Sitting here waiting at Gold Coast airport for return flight home to Melbourne plane has been delayed for 5 hours. This is the third time in a few weeks that this has happened one of which ended up eventually being cancellednotified at 10pm after several delays and hanging around the airport for over 6 hours. Half expecting the same thing again today well see. Meanwhile 4 planes Virgin Jetstar flights have left for Melbourne. Will never ever travel Tigerair again.
Singapore to Nadi with Fiji Airways. Service excellent and cabin crew were friendly attentive and approachable. They ensured customers feel at home. During the flight numerous checks offering water juice to passengers. Seats were comfortable. Ample legroom for a 59 guy. Inflight entertainment would be my only gripe. I exhausted the list of movies pretty quickly during my flight. Food is comprehensive and sufficient. Wide selection 3 choices and they were tasty.
The standards in TAP have been going down in the past couple of years but it got to a point where it is all low cost but the price. For starters I have been flying with them for 12 years and not once has been baggage been weighed. Apparently this has started now. I flew with them in March 2023 and as always nobody cared about my hand luggage I frequently take a trolley and a backpack and a lot of times Ive also taken a small ecobag with fragile items I dont want to put in my backpack. My last flight on 24th June 2023 from London Gatwick was different though. The lady who checked my luggage wanted to weigh it so she asked me to put my trolley in the scales and shouted I was over the limit. Highly unprofessional and rude but then she proceeded to make me even more uncomfortable when she said loudly not one but three times that I was taking 3 items instead of 2 referring to my ecobag. I was never given an opportunity to take anything out of my suitcase or rearrange my things instead she took the trolley and asked me to pay 68 straight away. I also noticed there appears to be double standards as the lady on the other counter who was also boarding passengers didnt check any luggage. In addition the economic crisis seem to be have hit hard as before we used to have a snack on board and now not even a glass of water. I would find this acceptable if I had paid a fair amount for this poor service but TAP seems to forget that they are overpriced for the quality they are presenting customers with nowadays. Very disappointed and dissatisfied. Will go out of my way to avoid flying with them for the near future.
We were monitoring the prices for flights to SINCGK for the past two days. Prices were ranging from S96 and above. On the third day Jetstar had added 4 flightsday for the whole Month of Sept 2020 and dropped the price of their tickets by half. We thought it was a luxury to have 4 flightsday in this Covid era. Naively we bought the ticket for my domestic helper at S54. Two weeks later we received an email that flight was cancelled due to Covid like it wasnt 2 weeks ago. Terms and condition No refund allowed. We were suppose to redeem other flights using credit voucher. No big deal we would just select the next available date. The thing is the prices has been inflated back to S118. This has left me a very distasteful baitful experience with Jetstar.
Paris to Taipei. Fantastic experience in Economy Class. Very kind and professional cabin crew who make you comfortable and understand the challenges you face when traveling with very young children. Food was really good entertainment system was topnotch. The seats were very comfortable and we didnt struggle to sleep during our 12hrs flight. Great wifi not streaming fast but fast enough to browse the web. Arrived on time and luggage were delivered promptly in Taipei. One of the best airlines you can fly with.
Worst airline. Moved flight three times with no regard to connecting flights visa expiry personal need to arrive on the day. Not flight delays complete three times date changes on the flights. We regret to inform you that your flight has been changed to xx date Never seen this happen before. Customer care doesnt pick phone nor replies to mails. Cannot cancel online. Extremely rude staff at Subang airport when you go to their counter. They keep shuttling you from one point to another point. No answers no responsibility.
I booked a flight LGWBKK on 0522 Flight departing 18922 On the 6922 I emailed scoot to check the flight was still scheduled to leave on the 18th as Id seen a few flights had been cancelled they just ignored me. 18922 day of my flight the Scoot app was telling me to go to the airport. The flight had been cancelled but I had not been informed. They just left me stranded. I had to buy another ticket at a cost of 700 had they informed me of the cancellation this would have been a lot cheaper. I claimed my entitled compensation from Scoot to be told they had emailed me on the 7th July and informed me of the cancellation and no its not in my junk folder I checked with my private email provider they had not made contact with me they are basically just lying as this gets them out of having to pay compensation. I asked for proof of this and received something a 10 year old could have knocked up in photoshop It did not prove anything. They take about 8 weeks to respond to you if youre lucky they dont answer the phone for hours when the call gets tricky they just hang up. Whatever you do do not fly with this airline they dont care about you or any rights you have they will just lie. Finally after a year I got my money back but no compensation.
Flew Newcastle to Trivandrum via Dubai. Emirates is one of the few remaining airlines that offers a differential in Economy class. I love other airlines in Premium Business or First but so few airlines now stand out with their Economy product. Emirates offers a fabulous economy product the seat is comfortable there is sufficient leg room for me at 6 foot 2. The food is good I like being provided with a menu prior to service a nice touch. Entertainment is the best in the sky in my experience. A free 20mb of internet browsing is extremely handy if you need to connect and do not want to spend lots of money as is the case with the relatively few airlines that offer any internet service at all. If you want more internet the prices are reasonable. Emirates crews are always in my experience excellent. My only personal regret about Emirates is they do not have a competitive price to fly between the UK and Brazil. Its a very long way of getting to Brazil from UK I do this route frequently. They have such good deals to Africa and Asia I wish they would do the same for South America so I could fly with them more often
Overnight club world flight from Rio to London. Check in at Rio was efficient. Third party lounge Premium plaza which was reasonable and had enough space. No fast track security lanes in Rio. Plane ready near enough on time with well organized boarding. On board standard club world service. My feeling is that the food and beverage quality is not as good as it used to be. Granted they only loaded one of the wine options which was wasnt great either. Food itself not terribly appetizing. Breakfast quite rushed which it did not need to be given the long nature of the flight. Flight landed on time priority bags worked and were off quickly. An average experience. However BA were not the lowest cost option on this route at the time of booking that was Air France a carrier I rate highly but they were a direct flight.
Good journey from Manchester to Dubai. Had a 1hr 25min connection time for our flight to Bangkok. When we got to Dubai the plane seemed to take an age to park up the pilot said that there was a slight delay as waiting for a slot. We stopped and were bussed off why does such a modern airport have to bus people off such a large modern aircraft Eventually got on to our bus. Bus starts up and takes what seems like forever to get to terminal people around us even joked that were going straight into town it just kept driving driving. Ive never been on a plane to terminal bus that long ever. As we got off an airport official was asked about Bangkok flight and says you better run for it So we run for it two adults and a child. Eventually get to the gate hot and sweaty no time for water or coffee angry that we had to run. No explanation as to why we had to run for our connecting flight. We show our stuff and then try to find our way to the plane. Nobody there to help point the way etc we had to ask cleaners where the plane was. Got on the plane for another 6.30hrs flight hot thirsty and angry. The staff on the plane were really nice and gave us some water. We dont fly very often but when we do well think twice about flying with Emirates again.
I think the worst airline I have ever travelled. Do not use them unless you have to. Business class is the worst I have flown uncomfortable seats poor quality food and the worst entertainment I have seen on an airline. To cap it all they have lost my baggage which is where they unravel even further with customer service that is completely nonexistent. They dont answer the phone dont respond to emails and their online chat means waiting for 30 minutes and then realising that they actually have no one there at any time of day. Its a novel way of taking responsibility for their failings just dont answer. I cannot understand how Sky Team can associate with this airline. I will not fly with them again and nor will anyone in my business.
Always delayed due to technical issues. I wonder why only Spicejet flights are delayed. Its has become a habit for such airlines to operate without bothering customer service and satisfaction.
Mumbai to Dubai. As we entered the flight we were welcomed by the cabin crew. Safety demonstrations done in three languages English Arabic and Hindi. The food they served was delicious. The aircraft was clean and the legroom was also good. Always a pleasure to fly with Emirates.
You get what you pay for with Ryanair. Uneventful flight left on time friendly and efficient crew. Their website for booking and check in has become a bit of nightmare and can be very confusing used to be lot better in the past.
Terrible experience flying with Sri Lankan. They delayed my flight by 8 hours at Male and then again by 7 hours in Colombo. All this time seats were available with other airlines but they refused to transfer us. My wife and I slept on the cold airport floor since none of the airport lounges had any vacancies and we were afraid to enter SriLanka riots are going on. SriLankan Airlines staff were explicitly rude and hostile. They lacked basic communication skills and wouldnt even maintain eye contact. They were extremely unprofessional not only with their work but their attitude as well. Several passengers especially the elderly and families with young children struggled a lot and they were given a meal coupon as a pacifier. Cabin crew however were polite and warm during the flight which is their only saving grace. The airline is very cheap yes. But they will play you like a piece of baggage. Dont travel with them.
I am 84 years female with hearing impaired and limited mobility. I boarded from India. After landing at Istanbul I was not provided a wheelchair from the airlines gate. Was made to walk without much assistance. After a long wait I was put on a cart along with other senior passengers. There after we were made to change to wheelchair and again on another cart and finally after 2 hours I reached my gate D 3 to board flight to Chicago. I am wondering whether the lapse in the assistance was from Turkish Airlines or Istanbul airport authority but I faced lots of hardship and a bad experience. Hopefully I may not have such bad experience on my return flight on 11 August 2022 from Newark to India via Istanbul.
KIVKBPODS. Both flights were codeshared with Aerosvit but operated by Dniproavia planes. KIVKBP Embraer 145 that has seen better days. KBPODS plane was an oldlooking Boeing 737500. Service onboard was good. Offered drinks and a double sandwich despite both flights being under 1hr. Flights departed on time. They almost lost my luggage on the first flight as it was sent to connecting flights but were able to locate it relatively quickly and hand it back. Overall a relatively good experience for the price paid.
Flew Sydney to London via Seoul and return in economy. After reading many reviews about Asiana I thought Id fly with them this time back to the UK but after this time I wont bother again. Its not that theyre bad but SIA and Cathay Pacific are so much better. The food was nothing special and rather odd in texture the entertainment system was old with poor response from the touch screen and very limited choice of movies. I dont sleep well on flights so usually spend a lot of time watching movies I didnt finish one. Baggage allowance was a measly 20kg. Not that I expect to travel with all my household furnishings but Id like to travel and not worry Im going to go over my weight allowance. On the outbound flight from Sydney my wife was asleep so I ate her snack my bad. After she woke up I went to see if I could get her another one. That was a no as she already had her allocated snack. With Cathay just in the crew area they have bowls of fruit and other snacks that you can help yourself to. Want something hot no bother with CX have some noodles. An annoying thing when youre trying to sleep is that whenever we hit turbulence the screen would light up. I dont understand Korean and maybe its something to do with the Korean language but youd get these long announcements but in English it ends up garbled and very brief. Does Korean use more to say less Im Asian myself and can understand that many Asians have trouble with the English language but considering English is the language all airlines are supposed to use the standard was poor and I missed more than I actually caught. I suppose you get what you pay for and they where at the cheaper end of the price scale but still its the little things that add up to make it a less than an experience Id want to repeat.
Checkin was easy at ICN but with a disappointing lounge situation Emirates does not own a lounge at ICN. Inflight service was generally great although business class was quite full. Connection in Dubai was also not problematic security for connecting passengers was fastflowing and shopping and restaurants were open. Second flight was on a B777300 but similar levels of comfort and service was for business class. The business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people including myself the inflight service could experience delays as too many business class passengers are waiting to be served the transit lounge at Dubai tend to be overcrowded and the inflight Internet offering is far from satisfactory. In my case the inflight Internet could be purchased at 1999 for a 10hour flight excluding takeoff and landing the Internet would only be provided for 8 hours at most and streaming would still be blocked.
Manchester to New York JFK. Surprised at how good our flight was after reading some negative reviews. The A330 seemed quite roomy probably as it was in a 242 configuration also liked that the toilets were downstairs 4 of them also one at the back of the plane if anyone has difficulty with stairs. Although this was a full flight service on board was excellent. The economy class IFE is a bit limited however as the flight had a 90 minute delay they opened up the premium entertainment for free in economy normally cost 5.00 which was a nice touch. The food was pretty good also. The 3 course James Martin inspired lunch was excellent and a snack was also provided one hour prior to landing. Unlike many other low cost airlines meals are included in the ticket price. Seat pitch was 31 and felt very comfortable. A pillow and a bottle of water is provided and on the overnight return flight a blanket was also provided. All in all this was a very pleasant flight and the 7.5 hour flight passed pretty quickly and pleasantly. I would definitely be happy to fly longhaul with Thomas Cook again.
I actually cannot review the flight because I did have to cancel my ticket but I had such an amazing experience with their customer service I had to review them. Also I immediately booked a new flight through them so I can update this next month when I do fly. I am not sure if this is the best airline or I was given special treatment because of my situation. Although this must happen to people all the time. The trip I was planning for a year was ripped away from me the weekend before I leave. I was devastated. Asiana really tried to work with us to change our plans but still leave the same time we were supposed to although that fell through to you need a permit for specific medications long story short I had to cancel all together. They say refunds take 24 weeks and I needed the money to book new tickets so I was really hoping it would come in two weeks but it came in 1 They were just nothing but nice and helpful. No crazy fees or anything. I truly love this airline I felt the really cared for me or at least about my experience with them.
Brisbane New Caledonia Tahiti. First leg was in a bright clean new A330. Business cabin only half full. My eticket had said cold meal but I was served a full hot dinner with quality French wines for just a 2 hour flight. IFE was adequate but surprisingly had no classical music. Flight was 50 min late departing because of late arrival of the aircraft which I suspect was due ongoing issues at Brisbane airport. The fairly new international airport for New Caledonia was bright and welcoming. The business lounge was small but modern. Excellent canapes and miniature cremes brulees. The flight for the second leg was operated by Air Tahiti Nui. This was not a codeshare as Air Tahiti Nui do not offer the flight themselves. A bright clean new A340. I was served a full hot lunch with quality French wines. IFE was satisfactory by modern standards. Overall a very high standard of comfort and service.
Hong kong to Manila a short flight and service on the ground and inflight was excellent. Meal service used to be a full meal but Cathay Pacific has downgraded this to a Snack it comes in a small CX paper bag which i found cute. Meal service fast and efficient and they come around to offer more drinks after the snack bag. FAs are lovely. The cabin is clean IFE was excellent. Seat pitch is OK. Would fly them again for sure.
Singapore to Penang return. Worst Customer support I have experienced with any airline. I had to cancel my tickets due to the coronavirus outbreak. After trying multiple times and waiting for more than an hour on the line I was never able to get through to their customer support staff. Extremely disappointing and poor service.
This was my first time making use of Royal Air Maroc and I would say it was my worst experience since I started flying 20 years ago. The cabin crew staff are really nice and they try to make the most of the situation but the ground staff at Casablanca got angry at me for asking why my connection to Monrovia was delayed by 3 hours. The flight from Luanda to Casablanca offered 2 meals which both consisted of a dry roll with a slice of processed cheese a yogurt and a cold deformed muffin. The food to Monrovia was much better and of a much better quality. Also the plane from Luanda was old and needed maintenance and sitting close to the toilet with the broken door meant I could smell everything. I then had a 12 hour layover in Casablanca but the transit hotel was full from when I landed at 10am which meant I had sit on the airport for 12 hours with no place to just relax. The flight to Monrovia was then delayed by 3 hours and staff not once told us why but rather got angry and argued with us for asking why it was delayed. Only after some passenger vowed to shutdown the airport if our flight does not leave then ground staff appeared and angrily told us to board the plane. The service of ground staff is disgusting and they treat passenger like they are a nuisance to them rather than customers. They are rude have no patience and just could not care about making the experience comfortable for passengers.
Premium price for budget airline productservice. First time with MAS long haul flight. Considering its a 14 hr flight nothing is done to ensure passengers comfort. You dont even get an amenities bag. Seats were small and cramped with hardly any leg room. Im 152 cm Cabin crew seemed unfriendly and disgruntled. No smiles and very reluctant service. Ask for another drink with dinner you get a look. Ask for some water you get a small cup with barely 2 mouthfuls. Ask for more coffee with your breakfast it never came. Meals were small of poor quality and were served with a long 910 hour interval. Breakfast frittata was like eating plastic. Entertainment quite basic compared to other airlines. Movies TV shows were so heavily censored that you lose the plot sometimes. Truly the most disagreeable flight Ive been on. I will stick with the Middle Eastern carriers from now on. Better value for money and they actually know what customer service is.
London to Manila via Dubai. Here is an airline that has deteriorated in a spectacular fashion. I have flown with Emirates since the late 90s and had not used them recently. I decided to use them this year. What a shock This was not the Emirates that I used to know and liked immensely. Their aircraft are dirty and their staff both on the ground and in the air are inept and downright rude. In my particular case i originally booked flights from Gatwick to Manila via a two hour stopover in Dubai. After paying for the flights Emirates emailed me to say that the schedules had changed and I was now on a flight from Heathrow with a one hour stopover in Dubai. To be honest i was somewhat wary of such a tight connection time but I in hindsight stupidly trusted Emirates to get me to my destination on time. Well the inevitable happened. The flight from Heathrow was delayed thus causing me to miss my connecting flight to Manila. Incidentally having checked this particular flight EK004 it appears that it has been late departing from Heathrow virtually every evening. I would love to know how many other Manila bound passengers have missed their connection in this way over the last three months. The Emirates ground crew at Dubai were next to useless accommodating us in a shabby hotel in Dubai for a few hours and then sticking us on a Hong Kong bound flight that evening to connect with a Philippine Airlines flight the following morning. In short a planned 17 hour 1 stop journey became a 30 hour 2 stop journey. I contacted Emirates and asked why we had not been placed on the direct flight from Dubai to Manila that evening. We would have still been late but at least we would not have had to connect in Hong Kong. As yet no answer. In fact the response from Emirates has been condescending and wholly unsatisfactory. The Dubai ground crew and the Emirates customer service office give the impression that they are doing the delayed passengers a huge favour by shipping them out on a little bus to a Dubai hotel for a few hours and then placing them on later nondirect flights. The customer services rep in his email to me even had the brass neck to point out how expensive it is for Emirates to rebook us on to another airline at Hong Kong. Heres an idea Emirates stop rescheduling passengers on to flights with almost impossible connection times and get your passengers to their destinations as advertised. In conclusion we missed a late evening meet up with friends in Manila and I had to fork out 160 for new internal flights to our final destination as we had missed our original flights in Manila. Any potential Emirates passengers out there read these reviews and take heed. Avoid the headaches and book with an airline who actually know what they are doing. I certainly shall in future.
KLM used to be an excellent airline. Last September we flew Toulouse France to Vancouver with change of planes in Amsterdam. When checking in online about 18 hours before flight time I found that the first leg of the flight had been rescheduled to a later time so that we could not make the connection to Vancouver. KLM had never contacted me about this change. I phoned KLM and our Toulouse flight was changed to an early morning departure so that we could make the connection. This necessitated leaving a family get together and extra charges for an airport hotel and taxi. I claimed those expenses from KLM. After over three months KLM replied saying that as I had booked online on the KLM website KLM had no obligation to notify me but I had an obligation to keep checking for changes in the schedule. So it was my fault and I was entitled to no compensation. Every other airline I know even low cost ones never fails to email customers about schedule changes. So KLM had the gall to blame the victim me for their poor service.
Long waits and delays poor check in service they had lost our booking. If you try to eat the cardboard bread roll youll need the bottle of water take your own inflight movie as there is none.
Istanbul to Manila. My baggage was mishandled by this airline. I have been travelling for 2 months over Europe and Africa and this has never happened to me up until I took this airline. My baggage was delayed and they did not even have the courtesy to directly deliver my baggage to me. They want me to go through the hassle of picking it up from the airport even when they caused the mishap and inconvenience in the first place. It took me 3 weeks to get my luggage back. When I tried to get updates they pass me around and not give me clear answers. Very bad customer service. Word of caution to everyone be wary in taking this airline. I wont be flying with them again for sure.
London to Delhi. A truly first class experience from check in to landing. I am a frequent flyer with BA and have not always had an amazing experience this one was. Check in was easy and swift and the Concorde Room was excellent. The flight itself was wonderful while I accept it isnt the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none. The cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats. Throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing. New soft product is very good and food definitely much improved.
My wife and I booked Delta OneFirst Class seats 3 months ago to Hawaii to celebrate our 46th anniversary. On the afternoon before our 6am flight to MSP and on to HNL we received a message from Delta that our equipment changed and that on the Minneapolis to Honolulu flight 8 hours my wife was in a coach seat. After spending hours on the phone we were informed that the only way we could get Delta One seats for both of us was to fly to Detroit spend the night and then fly to Honolulu the next morning thus losing one day in Hawaii of our vacation. We did so and upon arriving at the checkin in Detroit there was no Delta One seat for my wife and she had an 8 hour flight in coach I would have traded with her but I am 64 and could not fit in her seat. We finally made it to Hawaii on a very sour note for our anniversary and when we checked in for our return flight my wife was again in coach. After hours on the phone with Delta and Delta Vacations we were told we both had Delta One tickets but could not confirm until we arrived at the airport. There is no way to call the Delta agent in Honolulu and Delta reservations has no control over the flight the 24 hours before the flight. We did have Delta One seats when we got to the airport but not next to each other as I have originally booked 3 months before. After arriving home after the 46th Anniversary trip from hell thanks to Delta I filed a complaint and waited for a communication regarding refunding the difference between my wifes Delta One and coach seat. That has been 6 days and Ive heard nothing from Delta I am currently on hold and have been so for an hour. This is the worst customer service I have ever seen. Do not book Delta.
KL Subang to Kuantan. Very punctual departed according to schedule. The crew were cheery and extremely professional for a flight that was just 50 mins. For a short flight they served a light meal too Highly recommended.
Dublin to Xiamen via Amsterdam. The crew were really pleasant and went out of their way to be helpful. Very clean plane and comfortable seat the usual lie flat. Entertainment was so poor with a very small selection of movies. Maybe we expect more as the westernmideastern airlines give you a really decent selection. The food was below par and no great shakes at all. Big nono they did not serve any vodka This is a very first for me on any airline worldwide and I fly 3040 times a year. With gin is this possibly the worlds most popular white spirt I only drink an odd vodka and tonic so I went without. However for the value and it was an offer I had to give 4 stars. Other airlines for my destination were 4500 more expensive and that is a big saving. If the fare narrows to 2250 I would fly another.
Brussels to Bristol. My boyfriend and I arrived at the day of the flight to the airport when they told us at the security gate that our flight got cancelled. We had to wait 8 hours at Brussels airport and then we flew to Birmingham. Our original flight was to Bristol. From Birmingham we had to pay from our own pockets a train to Bristol that was not cheap at all. Until today 7 months after the only thing that we heard from BMI is that they will eventually pay this was said in August and to be patient. We are still waiting for costcoverage and compensation.
I found a really good deal on business class flights to Singapore from Chicago. I was very leery at first due to some of the reviews but I had a very pleasant experience. The staff was helpful and the plane was nice. Dealing with the US customer service to pick seats etc is a little frustrating but overall I have no real complaints.
Japan Airlines is no doubt best airline in the world and deserve a 6 star rating as it is better than many of the 5 star airlines on Skytrax. The thing standing out is the service of the cabin attendants. They are always very polite efficient and have a great attention to details eg when they see bathroom on the other aisle is vacant they will direct passengers to the empty bathroom. Seat pitch is wide but the sky wider seat has poor padding. I would say Japan Airlines has built in a lot of service elements based on Asian preference if you are not an Asian or are more comfortable sticking with the western style say food or move options or you are just a fan of alcohol then you will be disappointed.
I flew this with this airline around the Indian Ocean with this airline for business purposes. There punctuality is great they are more often before time rather than on time. Recently i got the opportunity to try there new RUNCDGRUN flight in club class. Here also am very satisfied. There REPS in Mauritius are very competent. I recommend you this airline.
One can keep writing a negative review endlessly if unluckily he has traveled by Air India but Ill keep it short and here is my review The flight was delayed by 5 hours. Passengers were barred from entering the airport building as the flight was delayed to avoid overcrowding and a makeshift counter without personnel was arranged and of course without a proper seating facility. There were hardly 15 chairs for more than 100 people. As it is summer in Saudi Arabia the temperature outside was around 40 degrees Celsius. The airline representative appeared once in a while and responded rudely to any queries on flight status. Experience inside the plane is another horrible experience. We felt like we were in an airplane just because it was flying. Other than that it is comparable to local buses in developing countries. Seats were small and uncomfortable even with economy standards. Regarding the food I bet it cannot be any cheaper than what was served. I have pledged not to travel with Air India anymore. Best of luck to those who still want to try flying with Air India.
London to Glasgow with British Airways. Flight is again delayed its not like its a one off as its delayed every week like a bad joke. Really a poor yet very expensive airline who I wouldnt recommend to any traveller.
My outward flight from Gatwick airport to Monastir Tunisia was delayed by four hours no real explanation was given and apologies seemed less than sincere. Worst still was the return journey. There was a sevenhour delay and there were no ground staff available. The announcement that passengers were to be taken from the airport to a local hotel were so disorganised and unintelligble that several passengers missed the announcements altogether. Again no representatives from the airline showed themselves. The meal provided at the hotel burgers lukewarm vegetables and potatoes followed by melon pieces was to say the least poor. While the inflight cabin service and catering were reasonable the airline seemed not to care a jot about the inconvenience to passengers on both outward and return flights. Unless there is absolutely no other option I shall not fly with Karthargo again.
Tried to book on line with them but they do not take online bookings. So I rang reservations and I did not believe my ears. They do not accept a bank or credit card for payment Instead at the cost of GBP 20 I have to send a bankers draft to Romania
Never in my life have I encountered such incompetence and a lack of assistance from an airline. Poor customer service in the airport I was passed from one person to another for about three hours trying to solve the problem but none of them were able to assist. The layover in Istanbul was excessively long and thicket included a hotel but instead of resting in the hotel at night I wasted 3 hours of my time and nerves searching for and speaking with endless airport personnel and the rest of my connection time was spent in a freezing airport
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. The flight turns out perfectly and it went wrong with taking luggage at belt 17 frame and wheels slightly spoilt mean like it was a part of quotation letter or statutory declaration letter to submit in order to claim the bag from Jetstar.
Ive flown with Copa Airlines on a couple of occasions. The aircrafts have on both occasions been modern and either new or revamped with good air circulation. Value for money trumps many latin American airlines such as Avianca for sure. The main issue to beware is the customer service. My selected window seat was reassigned without my knowledge or consent. I discovered at the gate that I was reassigned a middle seat and my prior seat given away despite holding a ticket for that seat. On the aircraft I was told that I could ask someone to switch seats obviously I refused to do that and then told I had the option of getting off the aircraft I emailed the customer service department following the flight and they responded with waffle. Terrible service at every juncture. And this for a frequent flyer with platinum status on a partner airline so who knows how much worse they perform for others.
I had booked tickets for my family to visit me in Denmark in May 2020 the tickets got cancelled and no refund. I contacted customer care and they are suggesting evoucher. I am ready to take the evoucher but there is no flight from India to Denmark for this month next month and in May 2021. So logically I cannot use the evoucher. Aeroflot dont have flight for using evoucher so please refund my money.
The plane was very hot the flight attendants were rude and confrontational. They wouldnt serve drinks or dinner because they said to much turbulence but there was hardly any. Finally after about 4 hours they served us a Dixie cup of water. If you got up to go to the bathroom they yelled at you to get back to your seat. Worst flight I have ever taken.
NAPRMF round trip in August. It was a charter flight and everything went well with exception of long checkin queue before the return flight but the Marsa Alam Airport is small. FA present during the flight meals served and eatable double drink and coffee or tea. Legroom was enough for a charter flight for a 3 hour trip. A stupid guy smoked in the lavatory during the outbound flight and FA upon being called reacted quickly to enforce the safety rules. Think the fleet age is not the best possible. I cant rate safety standards or maintenance quality.
Flight CancunAmsterdam October 2014. Aircraft was changed and passengers like us who had bought comfort class were downgraded to economy. Flight was a nightmare with screaming kids and nonexistent flight attendants. Crew blocked some comfort class seats for themselves while passengers who had paid for them flew economy. Do not fly with them
Cairo to Bangkok via Dubai. Dont get fooled once you see an attractive ticket price as those attractive prices have a dark side in the TC especially when you are dealing with a big airline like emirates so they never solve the problem once it happens and you start getting bullied by their complaint department. You will be surprised after all the marketing they do and ads and they have those monsters in their back office what even make it worst is that I am a regular customer since 2008 I am on their skyward mileage reward with a very goodstrong history but still wasnt enough and they unleashed those complaint team on me. I bought a ticket with a stopover in Dubai and I wanted to extend my trip for only 1 day more so I went to their office and was notified that there is a condition in my ticket which doesnt allow me to stay 1 more day Max 7 days and if I want to stay then I have to pay several penalties which ends me up with paying almost the same price I paid for the 1st ticket So I asked the guy to check if I buy a new 1 way ticket on the same date and surprisingly it was half the price of those penalties they wanted to apply on me So I submitted a complaint and asked if there is a solution as simply the penalties doesnt make any sense especially when the 1 way ticket is half the price of the penalty and I also mentioned that who has the time to read the TC unless heshe has nothing to do in the world and I ended up my complaint with some cute pressure that if there is no solution then I would like to cancel my skyward. The complaint department replied with we know that you read the TC and we should apply those conditions on you and theres no way out and please confirm that you want to cancel your skyward so we start processing the cancelation They left me with no solution except checking 1 way ticket back. Anyway I only wanted to share my story so no one get fooled like me and if you have the time to read the TC then please do otherwise you will get bullied by their complaint department.
Ground staff are very unfriendly and not helpful making my trip unpleasant to start up with. The waiting line is also quite unorganized with no supporting staffs maintaining order. Nonetheless I was able to check in my luggages and headed to the boarding gate with no big problems. Seating comfort on the economy class in B777 and food quality are above average. The entertainment screen works fine. No delays on departure. I may not want to fly Emirates in the future.
BA website did not work weirdly deleted my flight from upcoming flights on the day of departure. Chaos at Cape Town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down. Chaos at the gate no queue management for premium passengers. Very nice new A350 with smart new club suite. Champagne warm cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold which is not true as Air France manage it. Disappointing meal wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives. Cheese ice cold and tasteless why cant the champagne white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese. Good IFE system but mediocre film selection. Disappointing breakfast. Overall 3 10. Flew Air France business the month before which was way better. So sad whats become of BA.
Much better than other airlines especially western European ones. I was very worried reading skytrax reviews before flying LOT but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of service flight ontime arrival and overall experience. Amazing value for money that saves at least 50 comparable to other airlines fares. Price includes 2 carryons regular cabin trolley and accessory which can even be a backpack. No weighin or measurement at the gate extremely friendly ground service. Onboard service similar to other airlines free snack water coffee and tea. No free alcohol or soft drinks so overall a much healthier choice. Staff are extremely polite and friendly one of the best in Europe I dont understand the unfair hate they get. Excellent covid measurements sanitary wipes disinfected seats table and toilets. Smooth flight excellent pilots. Planes are quite new compared to other airlines. Will definitely fly them again.
A terrible experience with customer service. If you need help from Air Transat forget about it you are on your own. We booked a package with Air Transat flight and accommodation. While at the airport departing to come home my son a minor received a false positive COVID test the day of our departure. Not the airlines fault clearly. That same day I was able to get a letter from the local health authority authorizing him to fly the following morning. After being on hold for over two hours Air Transat would not help rebook and effectively said we dont care not our problem. No attempt to rebook a flight out nothing. We ended up booking on another carrier to get back home. Air Transat literally abandoned a minor. This airline is not worth a second look.
I dont get why Germanwings is always late and on top offers such bad service. How is it possible that the ground staff makes an anouncement about late departure due to late arrival of an airplane 5 minutes before the official boarding time Wherever the plane came from it should be possible that the pilot contacts the ground staff at the point of destination the minute they leave with delay and from that time onwards it should be possible to calculate very clearly when the plane should arrive.
Flew on GA682 Jakarta to Sorong. I was able to check in at the SKY Priority desk and I was quickly escorted by the Garuda PSA Team member Yudi through security and into the Lounge. Soft drinks and snacks were provided in the lounge and staff were very helpful. When it came time for boarding Yudi also escorted me to the aircraft. Thank you Yudi much appreciated. The flight itself was an overnight flight and was quite full however the cabin crew managed to serve a meal and soft drinks and overall they were very helpful and engaging in the typical warm and friendly GarudaIndonesia way. We arrived in Sorong on time and it took approx. 15 minutes for my baggage to come out considering that early morning in Soring is very busy as many airlines arrive with 30 minutes of each other I found this a very acceptable time to wait. Overall another good flight on GarudaIndonesia.
Singapore to Paris. My husband and I chose Singapore Airlines for the first time to visit my brother who lives in Singapore. We thought it was one of the best company. Unfortunately it has the worst customer service weve seen. Our return flight from Singapore to Paris was delayed by 3 hours so that we missed the connecting flight with Air France in Paris. All the flights to go home were full for the following 2 days. We had to buy by ourselves 2 train tickets 188 euros to go back home. Our Air France tickets that we couldnt use because of the delay were nonrefundable. So we lost 246 euros because of SIA. After several mails to SIA because they dont reply to emails the company doesnt deign to pay 246 euros to compensate us. They only want to pay the difference between the train tickets end the Air France tickets 52 euros. Not logical. Plus they dont want to spend money to reply with postal mails. Only answers by email. Singapore Airlines dont have consideration for their customers. They dont take responsibility when their delayed flights have consequences on customers. We will never fly again with Singapore Airlines.
I had booked this trip as a miles trip due to expiring miles the cash tickets for these flights were quite expensive. Since we were ROP gold members we could use the priority counter which has been relocated to row H at Suvarnabhumi airport it used to be at row B. Check in was smooth since we were flying to Japan the agent asked if we had filled out Japan Pass which made us clear immigration and customs really quickly in Nagoya. During the evening The Royal Orchid Prestige lounge was extremely crowded however we did find a corner to ourselves far from the main food area but close to the bar Halal food area which had fewer options. There was more than enough food and we werent hungry when the flight took off so we could get more sleep. I also used a shower suite where Loccitane liquid soap and shampoo were provided. Boarding was an absolute mess the crew was late some passengers did not get their documents properly checked. This was made worse by the fact that gate C1 had very little seating and lots of passengers ended up sitting on the floor waiting for boarding. We had paid extra to get extralegroom seats about 50 USD each and they were worth it. The purser suggested that I move to the empty exit row seats in the second cabin so that my mum and brother could have a bit more space and comfort. This made the flight much more comfortable for them. I hate short overnight flights and a departure time of 0005 wasnt great no alternatives either. Most of the passengers were asleep before the flight even took off but I had stayed awake to get a bloody mary from the crew who bought me one from the galley. Prepandemic Thai Airways had a policy that they would have to serve their gold frequent fliers first. I am very glad that they kept this policy I was asked whether I would like Omelette with sausage or Shrimp Pad Thai. I chose the Shrimp Pad Thai which was very tasty flavourful. I jokingly asked if I could get a cappuccino which is normally only available for business class passengers. The FA said that she would try to get one for me which she did I asked to be woken up for the meal service. 2 hours prior to landing in Nagoya after some tossing and turning I was politely awoken had my breakfast placed on my tray. The crew were all very nice on both flights. On the return flight we flew out from SapporoChitose. The contract lounge in Sapporo had little in the way of amenities or food. Boarding was much better organised on this flight and we had our meal orders taken after being seated stewed chicken with mash potatoes or spicy fish curry with rice. I tasted both on this flight and both were very tasty albeit the fish used is pangas which isnt that great. Thai used to serve seabass which tastes much better. The highlight of the meal was the cake a simple vanilla sponge but really tasty. Before landing we were served a spinach pie which was also tasty but I wouldve preferred chicken. There was a small issue I had with the crew on this flight I found out the tray table wasnt clean when I looked at it during boarding the purser walked through told me to close it for departure but I pointed out the wet table to her she called one of the FAs to wipe it up. Entertainment is slightly lacking they could do with a few more films. Thai is still a great carrier maybe not as great as the prepandemic Thai Airways I feel like theyre 90 of what they used to be in 2019.
Due to all the negative reviews I was a bit nervous booking with Peach but booked anyway seeing as they were so much cheaper than any other airlines. In case you are uncertain about this company here is a snap shot of our experience with Peach. My wife and I recently returned from a trip to Asia and booked three flights with them a couple months in advance Osaka Taipei Taipei Tokyo and Tokyo Seoul. No flights were cancelled and all left on time. Most of the reviews were accurate about being a bit cramped one flight we couldnt sit beside each other and they didnt serve food or drinks without additional cost. At the same time paying that little for flights and seeing they are only 12hrs it was a big deal for us. If you want to pay 2 to 3 times more for a flight go ahead but if you want a cheap flight from Japan to surround countriescities we highly recommend Peach.
Seoul to Tokyo. This is the best lowcost airline I have flown. They have a free allowance of a personal item and bag on board as long as it is under 10kg. In reality you can take 2 bags with total weight under 10kg. Although from 28.10 this changes to 7kg. Flight was on time. Planes are new and clean. Japanese staff are the most polite and kind in the world. Seat pitch is low but thats because most passengers are small but the seats recline. If you are a big person I dont recommend flying with them otherwise they are the best in terms of value for money.
My flights had been cancelled and rescheduled with short notice. The customer service is a bot that isnt helpful with your needs and when you do speak to someone it is hard to communicate in English. If you dont book baggage its 60 for 15kgs and around 20 for every 1kg over. If I book my luggage earlier its 20kg for below 60. The lineups for check in were endless. So far when speaking to someone from AirAsia at the airport they have been nice and helpful though. No tvs for longer flights.
Horrible flight first time Ive ever flown transAtlantic when they charged for movies and TV and choices were slim and bad. They were two hours late on both legs of the flight and lost my luggage. Never had such a bad experience before.
Orlando to Gatwick. We received a text messageemail an hour or so before leaving for the airport saying our flight had been delayed by 4.5 hours however the checkin desk will still close at the normal time meaning we need to check in almost 6 hours prior to flying at the latest. Upon arriving I asked the checkin agent if they are about to close and she said no not until an hour before the flight. When I complained about the delay and the fact that we now have hours and hours to wait all evening in the airport when I had a suite still available to hang out in I was flat out ignored the member of staff refused to answer questions and proceeded to hurriedly check in our luggage. Eventually she pointed at a 4hour pre checkin sign and said well you need to check in 4 hours early anyway. I explained that I had never heard of that in my life how would a sign help if youre not at the airport yet but was ignored I later complained to someone else who explained this was when they opened and was only an advised time I showed him the TC website which states the standard 3 hours and told him how rude his colleague had been. The agent did not apologise or show any empathy or understanding. A colleague came over to explain further and provide a 10 meal voucher but also did not apologise or seem to care very much. She pointed out they are just third party staff and to contact TC. A little later I went back to complain to a manager and the agent just said there wasnt one. Then nothing we just stood there. Eventually a more experienced colleague overheard and took over apologising for the confusion on behalf of TC. Well eventually we got on to our flight and the pilot apologised and explained the reason for the delay repairing faulty smoke detectors. Service was okay not great. Entertainment food etc Im not really sure about as I was semiconscious the entire way but I get the impression its a more budget style airline doing longhaul flights. I bought exit seats which were small and had a ridiculously hidden recline switch which staff struggled to find dont think anyone actually used it from looking around also a stiff tv bracket but at least we could stretch out. When we landed there was an approx 2030 min delay in getting our baggage which was not appreciated.
Seriously frustrating to have my flight from London delayed over an hour only to find connecting flight closed. Over 20 passengers waiting at the gate and the plane shut the gate. Iberia leave a large group of people stranded wasting their COVID tests and legion of paper work. Now in line with over 50 stranded passengers and only two agents.
Los Angeles to Nadi. Great airline From the moment I stepped on board to the moment I left the arrival gate I felt safe secure and well taken care of. The seats were very comfortable and had lots of leg room the inflight entertainment varied from movies to video games which was very fun and the inflight food was included in the flights cost and was quite delicious served at very appropriate times and the portion was filling. Staff were friendly and attentive
Worst service today booked flight for a unaccompanied minor 10 years old arrived at OR Tambo 2hours before checkin had all the necessary documentation but was delayed by the airline staff to fill health questionnaires my brother was then checked in but left by the flight and they did not bother to communicate as to what transpired instead they are saying we arrived late and should have been at the airport 3hours before.
Faro to Gatwick. I regularly use Monarch Airline for short trips and family holidays.i have always been satisfied with the Customer Service and inflight staff. I have recommended Monarch to family and friends who tend to book through this airline. 2 weeks ago I travelled to Portugal Faro airport from London Gatwick. I was due to stay for a few month and book my return thereafter. However due to an immediate exceptional change in circumstances I had to book an earlier flight back o the UK. I didnt need to take my luggage with me just a small piece of hand luggage. I booked on line and accidentally clicked the 23k check in luggage. I rang Monarch to explain however the customer services adviser was quite dismissive as well as abrupt she advised me Monarch can add extra baggage but if something has been done in error or there are exceptional circumstances they cannot refund or change. I emailed Monarch and received an email reply from customer services reiterating the information i had been given over the phone sorry for the staff member i spoke to and added it will be looked into. No further comments were made except I apologise for any inconvenience caused. I emailed again and explained that I was not satisfied with the response. I explained that I will be returning to Portugal in 2 weeks and would like to book with Monarch again as I always do and in addition to this I have 5 of my family members travelling a few weeks after who would also like to book with Monarch. I received a reply 5 days later advising me that Monarch is a non refundable airline this applies to all fare and extras you wish to add regardless of exceptional circumstances. There was no mention or the fact that they will lose the custom of 6 regular members of my family including me who have been loyal customers over a number of years to Monarch. Monarch can take your money additional baggage allowances etc after checking in but due to exceptional circumstances they cannot make a simple decision to keep loyal customers. They said I should have read the terms and conditions prior to booking however under such circumstances you dont. I do think at times common sense must prevail however if your making as much money as Monarch do why would the loss of 5 regular customers matter. I will never use this airline again.
I had an absolute horrible experience with them. They do not care about their customers. I had a reservation leaving Iquitos Peru through Delta but the first leg of the flight was flown by LATAM. LATAM could not verify my flight and kept telling me that it was Deltas fault and I needed to talk to them. Delta put my family on five different flights over a 30 hr period and we missed ever single one due to an issue in the LATAM system. The agents in Iquitos Peru airport are rude do not know what they are doing. They would ignore me when I would talk to them at the counter and would get up from counter and walk away when I would walk up to them. I am extremely disappointed in LATAM and in the agents working in Iquitos Peru. They treated me so poorly. I will never fly LATAM again and would suggest the same for you.
CItyjet is a no nonsense airline with an ageing fleet. Their Avro RJ85s are really showing their age now with a lot of technical delays recently. My flight WX197 was delayed for almost two hours 02DEC on a multitude of reasons. Initially the scheduled plane had a technical fault.They flew a spare part in from Dublin but then the mechanics did not make it on time and a CityJet night stopper was rescheduled. This plane then had to be evacuated on a security issue and was no longer available for taking the flight back to Amsterdam. CityJet took some effort and flew a spare plane from Dublin which first had to be completely catered and cleaned. Once we were ready to go after 1hr 55 on the ground the flight was a normal and eventless flight of 42 minutes. These Avros are really showing their age not just in reliability but also the cabin and other interior.
Avelo set the bait now theyre yanking on the hook. Reel everybody in with low fares for the first year then raise the rates so you cant afford them next year. To good to be true. Prices are going up up and away see ya. So much for the little guy
Bangalore to Hyderabad one of the worst trip I have experienced. The bus to the plane was all tightly packed and the ac was not working. Aircraft seats not at all comfortable neither the plane was cool.
Arusha to Kigali via Dar es Salaam. I arrived to Kilimanjaro Airport at 4p.m after taking a bus because if I waited my belatedly flight I had never been arrived on time to Kigali. When I arrived they said me that my flight to Kigali is cancelled. They didnt know how long. I sat down and after 30min without information I spoke with a lot of people who works in the airport but not with personal of Rwandair because after they said me waiting they disappeared. Now finally I will take other flight with another airline to Dar Salam where I used to search someone who wants give me another ticket to flight to Kigali. They said me that I need to tell in Dar Salam my story another time to anybody of Rwandair. I dont know what more will happen. I feel that It is a bad airline company and It is the last time that I will take a flight with them. Also staff in Kilimanjaro Airport with this airlines are having inadequate and inpolite treatment. I feel so defrauded.
Guangzhou to Tokyo in September. To my surprise almost all restaurants inside the international terminal are closed because of the epidemic. I am very grateful that the China Southern Airlines ground staff checked my visa and took me to the China Southern Airlines lounge so that I could enjoy a wonderful breakfast.
I returned home from Norfolk Island to Sydney on Feb.102023 travelling business class. On arrival at Sydney when I went to collect my mobility walker I found it damaged and completely unusable as well as unsafe. I do not know what the baggage handlers did to it but it collapsed on me as soon as I started walking.Went5 to baggage claims waited 10 minutes while struggling to stand for a lady to give me forms to complete. It is now May 15 2023 and i still have had no response from Qantas despite 2 emails and 2 phone calls to them. I am definitely not happy with Australias best airline and will never fly with them again and I have advised family friends to boycott as well. The service on our outward flight from Sydney 7 days earlier was also terrible. I can only assume from reading other reviews that Qantas does not seem to care anymore about its customers. Never again Qantas.
Business Class service is equal to Economy Class on other airlines serving Brazil from Europe and USA. Service was fast only one time drinks were offered and cabin staff disappeared for most of the flight. Talking with one Flight Attendant she told me that after LAN took over TAM the airline is going down employees are unhappy. She even suggest me to take Lufthansa the next time
Put in complaint as flight cancelled and when asked for rebooking made it Mon instead of Sun. Then flight cancelled again Mon and airline rebooked for Tues. Already missed 1 day work couldnt miss another. Told had to get back to Sydney for work. Told could get flight to Canberra and then bus back to Sydney. No other options. Told them to cancel booking. Now been told have to wait 12 weeks or more for a refund. Totally unacceptable
Toronto to Belize delayed by 48 minutes. The flight attendants were rude to me. We were told to get our own alcoholic beverages from the back of the plane when asking for a refill. On our second flight there was no beer on a 5hour flight. Our 4 flights with Air Canada during our vacation was delayed or rescheduled. The airline overbooks flights and then asks people to wait until the next day to fly out.
Brisbane to London Heathrow via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific Airways. Considering the premium seats cost almost 4 times the economy seats I was really disappointed with the overall experience. Meal was exactly the same as what you receive in economy as is the amenity kit. When compared to PE in Qantas or BA this lacks a lot you get meals and drink service more in line with business class on those carriers. The only advantage if you are a OneWorld Emerald or Sapphire is getting access to the Pier Lounge at Hong Kong Airport otherwise if you dont have status and are looking for an upgrade other than just some extra leg room then I wouldnt recommend this. WIFI also didnt work on all 4 return legs of my flight despite there being a WIFI symbol on the walls. You would be better off spending your money on China Southern Airlines business class seat for a similar cost and get a lie flat seat or paying for economy on one leg business on the other with any airline. TIP Also avoid the front row aisle seats in premium I dont really have long legs 5ft6 and yet the air hostesses still knocked my feet every time they came through the door from business waking me up at least 4 times despite my legs not sticking out on the aisle.
Amsterdam to Bangalore via Dubai. Until now I have always enjoyed flying Emirates. Real quality however proves itself when things go wrong. And then Emirates customer service is very low quality. On our flight to Bangalore we got delayed by more than 10 hours. First airplane was hit by lightning and had to be checked replacement took long and when a new plane was ready and we had boarded it turned out that Bangalore airport was closed during the day due to construction works Emirates knew this before we had to offboard again in Dubai and wait for more than 8 hours. Except for some not too fresh rolls no help or service was provided. Customer service refused any help for instance helping to find a hotel a place to sleep or proper compensation. We were sent from one side of Dubai airport to another all the time. An online complaint only gets a marketing answer but no real solutions or compensation was provided. On the way back from Bangalore I had prebooked a dietary request Asian vegetarian. It turned out Asian vegetarian was a standard choice on this flight. By the time the trolly reached me all vegetarian meals were gone. As a vegetarian I only could chose chicken. The steward said they forgot about me and again I only could get a not too fresh roll. Again an online complaint some vague excuses as an answer but no real compensation. So to conclude in general Emirates is excellent but when problems arise the services they provide are like a low cost airliner. Disappointing and I do not know if I would recommend them.
Marseille to Boston via Madrid. Absolutely horrible customer service. Both during check in and while talking to customer service on the phone. At check in they did not allow me to check in due to covid testing policies even though I had my test scheduled at my stop in Madrid where they did not require a PCR. The lady forced me to call Iberia to try and find another flight back and when I did they kept me on hold for more than an hour and so I had to search for a flight back home on my own. When I called to ask for a refund they did not say anything more than that their system does not allow them to process a refund and would not let me speak to another representative. It was honestly just a very big waste if money for a returning flight I never attended or was helped to find another and never refunded. Save yourself money and stress DO NOT book with Iberia.
From start to finish the service food and cabin crew provided the very best. There are only 4 first class seats on the 777 and as expected more than enough space to stow belongings and move around the cabin. The cabin crew were attentive without being intrusive. Only two negatives. The toilets are tiny and one almost needs to be a contortionist to get changed into pyjamas and the seats although very wide do not have much padding or recline so are uncomfortable for sitting in for long periods of time. In the lie flat mode a good mattress was provided which made the bed comfortable. Food was exceptional and beautifully presented. Only hope that the hot towel service makes a comeback.
The connecting flight from Paris to New Delhi was cancelled. We were made to board the flight sat inside from 10.30am to 3pm after which announcement was made that flight is postponed to the next day. No one was assisting to answer queries. All we were told was to go to gate K57 and arrangements would be made. Only arrangement was made for business class passengers as if rest were travelling for free. Air France lounges denied entry even after many were ready to pay charges from pocket. It is 12.03 at night and no one from Air France has come.
Worst quality of food provided. The paneer roll was uncooked and not baked properly. No tray for breakfast was given. No tissue paper was given. No water in urinals.
I had a flight booked in April 2020 which was obviously cancelled. I have emailed and called many times to request some sort of update on my refund and the response is always the same In regards to your email your refund is still in process. it takes an unusually long time to process the refunds. Sorry for your inconvenience. The response never changes and never provides any clear information. I definitely understand the last year has been challenging. However I also had reservations with two other Thai airlines one has processed the refund and the other is at least providing updates and regular communication. At this point it feels like there is no intention of providing refunds. I recommend booking with any other airline.
Chicago to Guadalajara. Their customer service is horrible and they are hungry for money. We were informed that the policy is that we can change or cancel the fly and save our money if we call before the flight a few hours before the flight my elder grandmother lost her passport at the last minute and we were on the phone for 7 hours trying to come in contact with them they kept telling us that they were too busy and that we were and hold their website says 24 hours this is not true and the next thing when I tried to call they told us that our flight was lost and that they were going to keep our money this is horrible and I spoke to many people and they kept telling me the same thing and I told them that this was wrong what they were doing and that they shouldnt advertise that theyre website is 24 hours and that we can call before the flight if theyre not available. We even went to the airport and staff was unprofessional mocking our situation and when I asked her name she says your problems are not my fault.
Do not fly with this airline. Pay more money for another. Trust me Flight was delayed by 8 hours. They made us sit on the plane for 2 hours because they screwed up booking. Offered you nothing besides cookies for their multiple major mistakes. I usually understand delays but they really screwed up. The flight should have been cancelled. They were selfish by not cancelling and refunding. DO NOT FLY with Breeze Airways.
As this flight leaves Singapore after 1am there is no meal served after take off. In fact it was difficult to even get a drink. Whilst the flat beds are relatively comfortable they are also very narrow. The choice of breakfast served before arrival in Haneda was either Japanese or western. I opted for the western but the meal bore no resemblance whatsoever to a western breakfast and was mostly inedible. The overall service level was average at best. For the return flight to Singapore we flew from Narita but as in the same flight taken earlier this year the plane was almost an hour late in departing due to heavy traffic around 6pm. Passengers should also be reminded that the walk from the JAL lounge is around 15 minutes as the gate used for this flight is the furthest away on the particular pier thats used. The flight itself was acceptable although the food selection is not great. Moreover my wife was served half an before me even though our food order was taken at the same time. All in all not a great experience so next time we visit Japan we will be giving JAL a miss.
Singapore to Dhaka. Flew with Regent Airways for the first time today. Is it the airline policy not to provide blankets to passengers I thought it was a given in any airline.The staff mentioned to a male passenger it will be hot later on the plane so no need for blanket. What kind of explanation is that Paying for ticket is also paying for the service and goods within the airline for that period of travel for usage. Also the staff serving are not happy and dont smile. They should improve their service attitude.
Terrible experience with Delta. I will try to avoid flying them. Flight was on the ground not at the gate when we arrived they told us they didnt know where it was. Then after an hour late we were told it was in a hangar getting an issue fixed. We waited another hour for an update. They said they didnt really know what was going on the plane was still in the hangar. After 3 hours they brought then plane to the gate but it still had not been cleaned. Finally after 4 hours we boarded. Another technical issue had to reconnect bridge. Then taxing for 20 mins they discovered another technical issue and we had to return to the gate. The pilots had timed out so the flight was cancelled at 3.30am. I was told I would get a hotel and meal voucher by email but never did. Rescheduled on a flight the next day very little communication from Delta. The communication on the ground in Atlanta was rude and unhelpful. I thought Delta was supposed to have amazing customer service
Denpasar Bali to Washington via Beijing. Hellish barely begins to describe my one and hopefully only experience with China Eastern. The problems began right from the check in desk I knew my bags were going to be overweight what I didnt know was that this particular airline doesnt allow charging an extra fee and checking the bags anyway as with practically any other airline. I was forced to open up my bags and repack them then use two plastic bags the staff thankfully had the wherewithal to provide me to bring the rest of my baggage aboard the plane. The flight was cramped and uncomfortable and my seat just so happened to be directly in front of the couple traveling with their bawling infant son and the passenger who tilted his seat practically into my lap. I was tired from already having to be up at 130 am to catch this flight and it was impossible to get any amount of sleep on board. Had this been the worst of my experiences I might have ended up rating this airline a 4 or a 5 but the real problems began when I got to Beijing. In order to clear immigration at PEK you have to place your boarding pass photo ID and passport into a bag and give it to the officer for inspection. When I got the bag back after leaving the immigration office there was no passport. Worse still I couldnt reenter the office despite it simply being a flight of stairs away. I tried explaining this to the airport staff who were incredibly unhelpful and spoke next to no English. They generally kept trying to usher me to the terminal to catch my connecting flight despite my attempts to explain to them that I need the passport to be able to clear customs in the US in the first place. Either way it felt as though I was going to be stuck in Beijing. I wasnt wrong. After being sent all around the airport in a goose chase that lasted almost two hours airport security finally retrieved my passport and with an hour and a half to spare I was finally free to check in to my next flight. Crisis averted right Well as it turns out the checkin desk for my connecting flight was in Terminal 3 which happens to be a 20minute shuttle ride from the airport proper. Good thing all of this was explained to me in advance by the China Eastern staff oh wait it wasnt So naturally after waiting for 10 minutes for the shuttle and then riding it to Terminal 3 I missed my flight originally to Chicago because the checkin desk had just closed three minutes prior. Three minutes I explained to the staff that my family had driven all the way from Ohio to pick me up in Chicago and that I absolutely needed to catch this flight. But for whatever reason possibly terrible English comprehension nothing I said seemed to get through to them. They wouldnt even let me on the flight to Chicago that left a day later instead I was haphazardly tossed onto a flight to Washington DC that I then had to wait another six hours for. So in the end the backup flight which I wouldnt have needed had it not been for the incompetence of the immigration staff was an inconvenience not only to me but to my family. All in all flying with China Eastern has quite possibly been the most infuriating experience of my life. Trying to find anything positive to say about my experience is nigh impossible and I would never in good conscience recommend this airline to anyone.
Berlin to Manila via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines lost my luggage. It was delivered only 36 hours after my arrival. The worst thing was the way of delivery. A very rude guy brought the luggage to my place. He threatened me to throw the luggage on the street if i dont come down the stairway to pick it up. I complained via the feedback online form and now i am messaging with Turkish Airlines for more than 6 weeks. They refuse to give me any compensation for the stress. For me its the poorest customer service i ever experienced from an airline I will never fly Turkish Airlines again.
London to Los Angeles. Initially late boarding as aircraft was late on stand so cleaning couldve been better. Negatives over and everything else was superb The overall ambience isnt flash but rather understated elegance which you have to be British to fully understand I suppose. The champagne fine wines and cognac complimented the restaurant quality a la carte meal and the service was second to none from our geordie steward. We loved the fact that one of our cabins could be set as a table for 2.
Brisbane Singapore the flight was smooth the service was top notch very professional from entry to exit nothing was left unturned. It was a red eye flight but the cabin crew were still active throughout the cabin. This is why theyre sitting at second place in top 10 airlines in 2015. My only problems were the seat was kind of small for my size but that what you get for flying economy the inflight entertainment had a good selection of movies but the screen I felt wasnt clear in this day and age where HD is supreme and lastly the meal was smaller then I remember on my last Singapore Airlines flight 10 years ago. Overall highly recommended airline.
No issues. Flight left on time which also meant the flight arrived on time. Seats comfortable. Snack and water was given out on the flight. Smooth all round.
This airline is incredibly poor. First the flight was delayed three times while already on the plane due to technical issues. They claimed to have it fixed three times and three times it failed. After spending three hours on the plane and not moving plus dealing with the heat as they wouldnt turn the airconditioning on. We were offered the smallest bag of peanuts as compensation. I can accept a poor flight however we missed our connecting flight and were put on the next available flight at 330 in the morning ruining our planned transport and accommodation. We were given no compensation. But the thing that has tipped me over the edge is we decided to buy extra legroom for our return flight. After being hung up on we where finally able to book and pay for this. Then 36 hours later we were charged again for the same amount. I have really struggled in dealing with this airline and then to find out that they have held my card details for over 24 hours and felt it acceptable to change us with out consent is disgusting. I promise this will be the last time I fly with this airline
Flew LHR to Mumbai return with my husband very disappointing. The Galleries lounge at Terminal 5 was overcrowded noisy and had the feel of a cafeteria not the tranquil haven suggested by BA. The food was below average. Unable to avail ourselves of the spa facilities as they were fully booked. Not enough toilets for the number of people in the lounge and my husband had to queue We had to pay extra to guarantee 2 seats together to the tune of 240. When we boarded the aircraft Boeing 747400 the cabin crew appeared rushed and flustered they were not forthcoming with drinks or refreshments or particularly welcoming. The yin and yang seat configuration didnt work out well for us as we continually had to lean forward to talk to each other. The seat comfort was okay but quite narrow. My IFE did not work on the return flight. The inflight food was above average but not outstanding. Checkin at Mumbai for the return flight was very slow. We were kept waiting for at least 40 minutes with no apology for the delay. The business class lounge at Mumbai is appalling cannot be described as business class at all. No facilities the food very poor both in quality and selection and had clearly been hanging around for some time. The whole experience of BAs Club World was seriously underwhelming and we will not fly with them again.
I have flown Breeze several times and was beginning to enjoy their airline. Then flying back from Las Vegas my plane arrived at the gate on time. Then they had some kind of issue with how the plane was docked at the gate. They tried for a couple of hours to fix it. They boarded us. Then they had software problems or something. Then after a couple of hours they had us get off the plane because it was getting too hot in the Las Vegas summer sun. Who knew Las Vegas gets hot in the Summer Apparently not Breeze. After a few more hours they decided they could not get the plane fixed or cooled down and sent all of the passengers away saying that you could either rebook on another airline although there really werent more than a couple of expensive seats on those other airlines or get a hotel room on Breeze for the night. Thats where the problems begin again. I got a room at a nearby Holiday Inn Express nothing lavish. Cost 135. After I book the room Breeze sends an email and says you only have 6 days to apply for a hotel reimbursement and 20 for one meal. My total very inexpensive meals were 80 for dinner and breakfast. Plus an UBER back and forth to the airport. Breeze so far has only reimbursed me 20 and if I accept that payment I must click on an agreement that binds me to that settlement. They are all talk at the airport about how great they will be and then they fail miserably on the reimbursement process.
London to Miami. British Airways have been so disappointing and need to improve fast. They cancelled a flight the morning of a flight and so I had to buy a new flight. The compensation they offered was 22. Then my most recent trip was to Miami which I had an expired ESTA but instead of letting me know they could put me on flight for a small fee they let me buy a 1000 new flight. Then offered me a 112 refund when I phoned to complain. I am a BA member and must say the customer service is atrocious as a company its just spiralling down.
Absolutely horrible experience with Flair. Booking was easy but come closer to flight date they moved our flight to Toronto then 6 days out they email that our return flight is now returning a week later than it was supposed to. My parents return flight was canceled all together but not the one to Orlando Called put in virtual que for days no callback went online to try and get a refund that portal is under construction Absolutely horrible business.
Rhodes to Birmingham. We would just like to say a big thank you to all the crew on our aircraft from Rhodes to Birmingham that brought us back on the 29th September due to Thomas cook not trading anymore. The staff was so friendly and professional. Thank you once again .
After a grueling day getting off a cruise ship and waiting hours to pass through Immigration and Customs my daughter and I learned that our flight was delayed .. not once or twice but several times. Their excuse was inclement weather in the northeast but as it turns out as I happened to overhear from two airport staff guys later that day flight crews had refused to work our flight back to NY. Two hours after we were originally supposed to depart they canceled our flight with no real explanation. I scrambled to rebook another flight home and our only option was a flight on American to NJ instead of NY. I booked it though the app ended up paying for our seats and though we finally made it back my grief wasnt over. I have been trying to claim milespoints for that flight for us since and repeatedly that request was denied Jetblue lies about how to get your milespoints. You can request them all you want but youll never get them. Im going to stop flying JetBlue. Ill fly with a carrier that actually cares about their customers. Save yourself the aggravation and do the same.
Salvador da Bahia to Dublin via Rio de Janeiro and Paris. SSAGIGCDGDUB. Flight from Salvador da Bahia operated by Skyteam partner Gol. Rio to Paris on brand new Boeing 777300 reasonable pitch and friendly professional crew. Dinner and breakfast served both of which were pretty basic I have had better on intercontinental flights in economy. In flight entertainment system offered a reasonable selection of content in a variety of languages. In seat power and USB ports were also a nice addition. Paris to Dublin operated by Cityjet for Air France. RJ85 was showing its age but again the crew was professional and a light snack was served. Transit at CDG was surprisingly painless although food options are very limited in Terminal 2E.
This airline is the least comfortable I have ever flown on. Seat pitch is so low I could not comfortably for my legs in any way.
Barbados to Ogle Georgetown with LIAT. We were delayed until from 5.40 to 8.10 and there was no explanation then we boarded the aircraft and sit for 1 hr. After the aircraft was in the air we were told the bags were offloaded and that we were going to St Lucia to make a stop then I was told in st Lucia that we were delayed even further
Our flight was delayed by approximately 4 hours. I have tried to contact them to be compensated for this and I have heard nothing back from them. They had already delayed the flight by almost an hour 4 hours prior to departure time and then delayed it again shortly before that departure time. By the time we left people had been waiting so long that some were escorted off the flight for inebriation. Communication is non existent. I realize its a budget airline but this is unacceptable
Absolutely farcical service. Missed my connection at Toronto as the flight was delayed. Rebooked me via Montreal so needed an additional flight every one of the 4 flights I tried to make were delayed. Having eventually made it to San Jose about 30 hours later than intended they have also lost my bags. The worst possible airline and the worst possible service you could ever expect. Do not fly with them.
I had a round flight from Toronto to Yerevan by LOT. They were carrying tires with travelers baggage. Once I get to Yerevan and was waiting for my baggage I saw more than 30 tires came out on the surface in between of our baggage. My baggage was broken badly. When I sent a complain via form they sent me an email that because you passed 7 days you are not eligible for complain. Their staff do not care about you and no one passes the aisles during the flight and literally you cannot find anyone to request something That was the most terrible experience I have had ever
The Air Transat staff in Toronto was absolutely tremendous helping with a mixup of golf bags upon our return from Punta Cana. I mistakenly took the wrong bag and the Staff did everything possible to ensure the bag i had taken got returned to its rightful owner and that I received my bag promptly and with the utmost care. Thank you to the Air Transat Toronto Staff. You are terrific.
I had a very pleasant experience with Tigerair. It was only a short flight from Singapore to Hanoi but I was looked after and would be very happy to travel with them again. What I was most impressed with was their incredibly fast reply to my recent request for them to resend my eticket from almost 2 months ago. It was literally 15 minutes if that. I am extremely impressed with their post flight customer service.
Amazing cabin crew let me just say. Very attentive funny and helpful. Very rarely do I see the cabin crew literally helping every single person to put their baggage in the overhead compartments. Very friendly wake up calls for food or landing Very efficient with handing out meals and drinks and didnt run out of anything that I know of on the flights. Seats were spacious and comfy easily comparable to other bigname airlines. The Rwanda airport isnt impressive but does offer free wifi and it seems like all connecting flights are only there for a very short layover mine were 1 hour 19 minutes and the other 2 hours. Prompt boarding times And every flight we landed roughly 1030 minutes earlier then we were supposed to. I dont love the flight route due to there being so many stops along the way but definitely budget friendly so cant complain over all.
Third time using Rwandair business class to Kigali in the last 5 years and I am quite impressed by the consistency and professionalism of the airline. Recently I had to deal with the customer service department and was even more impressed by their professionalism emails answered promptly and perceived issues explained and dealt with efficiently. Nice to see an African airline punching above its weight in this business.
The crew BA656 on 6 June absolutely made this flight. Smooth journey with possibly the nicest crew Ive ever had. Rebooking for September we were that impressed.
Flew LHRIADLHR on new A380s in new World Traveller Plus. Overall great service and experience with hard working and friendly crews both ways. New WTP product is great. Seats are a huge improvement although 6 hours really is the limit on the overnight leg coming home for comfort. Food was good including my partners Vegan meal. New IFE excellent and really like the upgraded noise cancelling headphones. Only extra I would have liked would have been the option of a sparkling water or even wine as a pre take off drink. Have had the best and worst of BA over the years but this was definitely BA as it should be.
I will never fly Avelo Airlines again. The flight down to Wilmington was great We were very excited to have a direct flight to Wilmington as my brother lives there. Our experience leaving Wilmington however was not so wonderful. My son and I arrived at the airport an hour before the flight was supposed to leave. Wilmington is a small airport so we had plenty of time. The flight was scheduled to leave at 1200. We arrived at the gate at 1135 and the gate was already closed. There were no employees anywhere to be seen to help us. My son started waving to the groundcrew of the airport got their attention and they ran up the ramp to alert the airline crew. He came back down and gave us a thumbs up. We assumed that they were going to come open the gate and let us on. Nope. Next thing we see is the loading ramp pulling away from the airplane. When the gate crew came back into the airport we asked why they would not let us on and we were told that they were not allowed to reprint the manifestation. They were young kids that clearly did not care about us or the other two passengers one of which was in a wheelchair and had been in the bathroom that they left behind. When we asked when the next flight out was we were informed not until Monday. This was on a Friday. Needless to say we could not wait until Monday to fly home. I spent a lot of money to get us on a flight the next day into Boston. My car however was in New Haven I then called the airline itself and they said that they did nothing wrong and that they can close the gates a half an hour before the flight is supposed to leave if they want even if they do not have all of their passengers on board. No offer of a refund or anything.
Dubai to Frankfurt via Doha. It was the third time I had chosen Qatar Airways for a trip from Frankfurt to Dubai. It was the third time that I was overwhelmed by the quality of their product and the improvements. Qatar now has a branded Lounge in Dubai T1 calm spotless and much more pleasant. On bord its not only the sophisticated seat 787 the low number of seats per toilet the meal on demandservice or food and drinks they serve Guinness that are special. My favourite part are the crews who really hit the spot. They have an incredibly high level of anticipation of what you may want at every moment of the flight. Even when the cabin is fully booked they maintain the level. For me Qatar Airways is a class of its own.
Vancouver to Hong Kong via Xiamen. I arrived early at the airport before the check in booth opened. Waited in line for over an hour and chatted with other passengers in front of me during that time. When I arrived at the counter the check in clerk asked me where did I come from. I assumed she meant something about which line so I said this line the same one as the people you just checked in. She said that I was in the wrong line and that I had to go to the back of the other line for the other check in booth. I wondered if she thought I had cut in line or something so I told her if she had this type of doubt she should ask the people who were still standing next to me if I had been in their line all the time. She refused and told me to go to the back of the other line again and then proceeded to check in the next person in line. I was the last one to check in after waiting an additional 30 40 minutes. By this time it was so close to boarding that I had to run to security and then run to the boarding gate as the plane was already boarding. I had to skip going to duty free to pick up things for my friends in China as I had promised. Even though I had to use the washroom there was no time for that. No time to grab a snack or drink. It was the most embarrassing stressful situations I have experienced in a very long time. Actually I cant remember ever being treated like that before. The airlines bounced my complaint back and forth between the Vancouver and Xiamen offices and finally put the blame on me saying that if I had told her which line I was in this wouldnt have happened. What nonsense. Of course I told her that but she just ignored me and refused to serve me. I can understand a company hiring a bad employee but to back that person up when they know she was wrong is inexcusable.
Santiago de Cuba to Havana. The representatives are very unhelpful and would not recommend to use this airline. We had a delay from Santiago due to faults in the aeroplane and they did not have any information about how long it would take. We had another flight from Havana 3 hours later but we were not given any priority or help. The Cubana Airlines representative did not even want to tell us the name of the hotel where the other customers were spending the night until the aeroplane was fixed. In the end the delay lasted 18 hours and we lost all our flights back home. The airline did nothing to compensate for the flights lost and we had to buy new tickets to get back. To top it all when we finally arrived in Havana we spent 1 whole hour on the plane waiting for the plane stairs and a bus to take us to the arrivals. Horrible experience so make sure you have extra days to cater for any delays if booking with this airline
Emirates not to blame but Munich Airport Terminal 1 was a shame dirty unorganised very few options for food etc. In short not what to expect in Germany. Check in a bit tacky but friendly regarding visa and checkin system not running but after 20 mins I finally got my boarding pass. On both flights I got an excellent meal with appetiser main cheese and desert on a tray and it was no problem to get some wine with it. A generous perk as Silver EKmember is I was permitted into the Emirates Business Lounge in Dubai which is an excellent place for a shower some really good food.
For a regional airline Loganair gave a fantastic impression on me. It was expensive 200 one way however I booked at the very last minute at the FlexPlus fare. Lovely ground experience my bag was too big to be brought inside the cabin and the manager just kindly offered to place it in the cargo hold excellent flight crew and lovely service delicious cookies cold and hot beverages. Seats were comfortable for a turboprop and what I also liked very much was that the ATR72 was not as noisy as say Dash8. One thing I would suggest is that they introduce a fully refundable fare instead of just allowing to change flights with no charge.
The incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because French Air Traffic Controllers were on strike so we were routed over Germany and not BAs fault. O arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidance. It took around 40 minutes to find someone. Then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge. All told we were trapped on the plane for over an hour within metres of our gate. Total disruption wasted time. Absolutely no excuse for this.
It is an OK airline not very good. Timing is punctual. They made a lot of overbooking and asking passengers including me whether we can postpone one day. They promised hotel stay with all expenses. I did not accept their offer due to the urgency. Food I booked and got it in fine but quantity is very small. Air India Express is far better I think.
The Air Algerie fleet is totally renewed they now have brand new A330 on international routes safe and clean all flights are non smoking. The airport security is top notch. The food served onboard is good for medium range flights. Contrary to what some people say Air Algerie does allocate seats like other airlines but it is true that some passengers seem to not take that into account which tends to stress the staff into attitudes that are not very friendly during the first 15mns of boarding. Air Algerie has seen a huge improvement in service with the introduction of new planes. I recommend this airline yet I would like to see them adopt a world class frequent flyer program.
Im super unhappy about ANA service. They asked me and my daughter to move our luggage after we have settled down me and my daughter are both short but she didnt offer her help so that I almost dropped my luggage on one of passengers. Later during the breakfast time she didnt offer food to my daughter until I figured it out. My daughter is shy girl so I had to step out and ask her to bring the breakfast to her. This kind of things have never happened to me before. Im extremely unhappy about ANA service.
The worst customer service I experienced with an airline I experienced a very bad costumer service on the same day of my flight. I first decided to upgrade my cabin from economy to business. While talking to the sales executive on the phone and when realized that I will not be refunded for the seats I already selected and paid for in AM Plus I decided not to upgrade. After the call I received an email confirmation from Aeromexico and then I realized my initial seat selection which I paid for them 1 month in advance where canceled Checking on the app I had to repay to select the seats while those seats I chose initially were not available and even worse no 3 seats next to each other to accommodate my family Flying with a 2yearold I had no other choice to upgrade Apart from the very bad experience I had onboard in the business class from the quality of the food to behavior of the crew now the airline is refusing to pay the seats which were canceled by their sales executive Its an absolute scam and zero customer service as they blocked my number calling them No proper answer from the customer service via email as well. I do not recommend the airline at all
Jakarta to Sorong. Check in was straight forward and quick as was the security. I was escorted from the checkin through to the lounge by the Ms Rosma the Garuda ground support manager and one of her team. When time came for boarding I greeted at the aircraft door with a warm welcome and a smile. We pulled back from the gate a little ahead of schedule however we had a long taxi ride to the runway. Shortly after takeoff the main meal was served. The choice was two Asian rice dishes only with a choice of soft or warm drinks. I opted for a only bread roll. More hot cold drinks and snacks were served throughout the 3.40 hour flight. 30 minutes prior to landing in Sorong a bread roll was offered together with hot or cold drinks. Throughout the flight the toilets were cleaned and the cabin crew were very attentive through the flight. There were only two cabin crew in the business class section which was full however they provided a very good level of service and they were very polite and courteous. We landed in Sorong on schedule however I had to wait nearly 45 minutes for my baggage.
What a contrast to American Airlines. I flew Virgin America on an early morning flight from Las Vegas to San Francisco. The aircraft was clean and well presented the crew were happy to be there and the service was really great. I was dreading this flight as it was in economy but the crew were so good and the whole experience so very much better that the American Airlines flights I took in First Class. Clearly not all American carriers are the same. Well done Virgin America.
We had a flight from Dubai to London Heathrow with a 2hour transit in Baku. Due to the over 7hour delay from Azerbaijan Airlines in providing the flight to Baku we missed our next flight which was from Baku to London and their next available flight from Baku to London was in two days. After 30 minutes of the departure time the Dubai Airport staff at the boarding gate informed us that there is a delay but they do not know how long the delay would take and so we should purchase another ticket at the airport. As the next flight from Baku to London was in two days we had to purchase another super expensive ticket at the airport just to arrive at our destination to be at our work on time. Now not only they do not refund our first tickets which they could not provide the services for but they also do not refund the full cost of the new tickets.
Salzburg to Gatwick. Awful experience. Flight delayed due to operational reasons but this is forgiven as these things happen and BA handling in Salzburg did apologise for the delay. Once boarded with a full flight there were 4 crew members 2 to serve Club with about 8 passengers and 2 to serve about 120 or more economy passengers. Usual fight for bag space. I was desperate for some water and asked the crew can I buy some water as they dragged the trolley to the front of the cabin. I am in seat 23C right at the back. I am told no I have to wait for the trolley. I wait and wait and as we fasten our seat belts on descent to Gatwick the trolley gets to seat row 20. The 2 members of crew are still struggling to take card payments and tell row 20 that the service is now closed and pass the trolley back to the behind galley. All this as the CSD stands chatting in the Club galley with the other crew member. 14 of cabin not given the chance to even buy a glass of water in a 2 hour dinner time flight. No smiles from crew as busy doing math on what they are selling. Not even a flight map to help pass time. Terrible airline. A national disgrace worse than any budget carrier with high prices and terrible customer service. I am only rating this as 210 as they got me from A to B safely.
Manila to Paris return via Kuwait. The plane in the Manila sectors was amazing legroom was perfect. The inflight entertainment was good though not the best since I believe it caters more to Middle Eastern Passengers but the library of hollywood movies is still ok. Food is good and better than some airlines. Departure and arrival were on time. The Paris flights uses a different plane a much older plane. The legroom is less than the Manila flight. The service was still the same though. Ill ride Kuwait Airways again given the chance.
A very disappointing experience and Gulf Air has deteriorated greatly since I used it regularly 5 to 10 years ago. Cabin crew were reasonably polite but not particularly helpful and couldnt solve any issue. The quality of food was lamentable. Even though my flight via Singapore was very long and at night no blankets or pillows were available. Toilets were dirty and cabin crew did not seem at all concerned to keep them clean. Gulf Air seems to have become on a par with the most basic budget airlines.
A319 from FRA to LED on 201403. Very good seats sufficient leg room. Good food and beverages. I miss the glass of wine. No Audio Video onboard but fine for 3 hours. However for this excellent price it is acceptable.
Las Vegas to Paris via London. The staff were great but the 747 was the most uncomfortable flight in business class Ive experienced. The aisle seat felt like I was sitting in the aisle a business class configuration of 242. Thats a tight squeeze. Andthere were backward facing seats. The seats were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configuration. I was just glad I didnt pay full price for this flight.
Paris to Colombo via Dubai. On the way a seat that did not work completely and more than average food on the way back. But a crew that was attentive. The lounge of Paris is very average that of Colombo is zero and that of Dubai gigantic soulless but with a permanent service and very attentive. FR A laller un siege qui ne fonctionnait pas totalement et un nouriture plus que moyenne a laller comme au retour. Mais un equipage toujours attentionne. Le lounge de paris est tres tres moyen celui de Colombo est nul et celui de Dubai gigantesque sans ame mais avec un service permanent et tres attentionne.
I have been a loyal El Al member since 1993 so has my entire family. Up until my very last flight I have never had such issues with the staff and service and I may never fly with El Al again. Prior to booking my flight from Toronto to Tel Aviv I called El Al office to ensure that I get an exitrow seat. The agent advised me that there are several emergency row seats available and seat number 45A is free. I booked the ticket online selected that seat and got my confirmation email thinking everything is good to go but it wasnt. Once I arrived at Toronto Airport the agent gave me my boarding pass with seat 45A as they should have. However in preboarding they changed my seat to 28J between people. I asked the reason why and the agent refused to answer I asked for a supervisor which informed me that 45A is a paid seat and the plane is full therefore I will have to accept my 28J seat. I explained that I have a headache and I need a seat to be able to lean as I have migraines from time to time. Please explain to me how this is acceptable as my seat number was confirmed TWICE After waiting for 15 minutes the supervisor agreed to give me back my 45A seat. I proceeded onto the plane and after a short period of time the supervisor came back onto the plane and kicked me out of my seat. When I asked the reason why the supervisor said its because of my migraine. What does my migraine have anything to do with my original seat number The reason why I got a migraine in the first place is because of your beyond unprofessional staff members and their horrible service. This was an absolutely disgusting experience flying with El Al and it could have all been avoided if staff just honored my original seat number and listened to me.
High disappointment for the lack of a lounge in Yogyakarta for business class passengers. I had to wait several hours in the boarding area. They provide a voucher to be spent only in one of the worst coffee shop that is there who also claimed that the voucher does not allow to receive change.
Dubai to Milan. Emirates normally provides excellent service yet one weak link staff member could damage the airlines image. Although gold customers we entered from the business lounge to upper deck holding economy tickets owing to Gate boarding directions. The boarding staff was unwelcoming rude and arrogant over what he wrongly perceived was our error not Emirates operations. Worse still. Indicating clear distress from my recent spine injection he said that doesnt matter. Leaving me to carry me with no assistance from aircraft staff to change levels. Once seated we could hear the clunks from others changing levels so we were not alone. My wife and I were considering upgrading at the service desk. It was unattended and the flight was late and no alternative access appeared to an economy gate was closed or not properly indicated. Miserable staff member this flight only.
Terrible airline. The airplane was dirty and very small for a ColomboDubai flight. The crew was rude. They served all the food at start so they wouldnt have to bother doing anything later. They announced landing one hour before it actually took place closed the toilets so they wouldnt have to clean them. Terrible rude staff avoid at all costs.
I had one of the most pleasant flying experience with Japan Airlines from New York JFK to Tokyo Narita. I had heard about their Boeing 777 Sky Wider Economy seating with only 9 abreast opposed to commonly used 10 abreast and a generous seat width and pitch plus some other nice features. I always wondered if an inch or two here or there really count. I was wrong. It does matter and with one less seat in a row made an enormous difference on this 13 hours flight. A premeal drink service was followed by a 7 dish lunch including miso soup and ice cream. Another meal was served before landing. What set them apart was the staff who were caring polite and courteous. The kind of service which is becoming rare or found only in premium cabins. They made numerous rounds with drinks during the flight. I saw them caring for babies and observed one of the crew making an origami for them in the galley. Entertainment system was adequate with high quality screen displays. Announcements in English could be clearer. My Oneworld Sapphire status AA Platinum was fully acknowledged at the checkin counter and other ground services.
They leave exit rows empty rather than let anyone sit there. Horrible customer service policy. Garbage profiteering waste of legroom. The attendants would rather leave exit rows unoccupied which seems unsafe than let anyone get something they didnt pay for.
Flew Fiji Airways from Brisbane to Los Angeles with a 5 hours stopover in Nadi. Flight to Nadi only had entertainment via a few screens and was rather poor however service and meals were really good for an airline. Ended up paying to go into the lounge in Nadi which was worth every cent highly recommended. Flight from Nadi to Los Angeles was excellent and even managed to get a few extra seats to get some sleep. For the price we paid we were very happy.
Kuala Lumpur to Copenhagen via Doha in March 2017. The ticket was the return travel on an extremely cheap economy ticket purchased for less than 500 USD several months prior to travel. Despite the ticket is in Oclass and thus not upgradable they sent me an offer 2 weeks before to pay 400 USD extra for the last sector to CPH. I could not resist as this also gave me access to Al Mourjan Lounge in Doha where I spent 15 hours which I dont mind. First sector in Kuala Lumpur I tried all 3 lounges offered Plaza Premium Golden Business and First Class. All were good. As the flight was only 3040 full and as I am elite flyer they gave me 4 seats on the A340600 to stretch out. In economy I was pampered throughout. Special meal accommodated and other meals offered. Drink rounds very very frequent and staff super alert. IFE fine. At arrival in Doha only bus transport available to Terminal. Second flight on a Boeing 7878 flight on time. Contactgate in Doha. That makes things much easier and allowed for leaving the lounge late as the walk took only 5 Minutes from lounge to aircraft. Good service onboard despite business class was full. Good food excellent wines poor beers. It annoys me that they request charity support from passengers for the Educate a Child charity. They want people to put money in envelopes onboard I find this extremely intrusive and disrespectful to passengers.
Tenerife Sur to Asturias. Punctual both on the outbound flight and on the return flight. Comfortable seats good distance between rows. Friendly checkin staff and flight attendants attentive to the needs of passengers. Very satisfied overall. We will repeat the flight with this company.
The worst airline service in the world they dont let us know when a flight is cancelled and the airport services are terrible. Dont use this airline any longer.
Qantas are currently flying their first class configured A380s to and from Hong Kong although they are not selling first class. Instead premium frequent flyers who have booked business class are given the option to select available seats in first class. Good thing they are not selling first class. Seats were worn and some functionality was inoperable. Service was equally dismal with cabin crew reminding passengers that despite sitting in the first class section we should only expect business class service. Fair enough but this excuse was rolled out whenever someone asked for something basic. This aircraft should have been refurbished before being brought back in to service.
RGNSNW. Quick boarding with allocated seating for 45 minute flight in ATR72 to Ngapali Beach. Good safety briefing before time take off and light snack and drink en route. Pleasant FAs smooth flight and great landing over the surf and through the palm trees to this small exRAF WW11 strip on the Bay of Bengal. Luggage is delivered by handcart to the entrance gatesexpect to pay 500kyat per piece.
My first and will be the last flight with them. Going back to Chicago is a nightmare with this airlines. Our flight was delayed for 4x then cancelled for the next day. Were in the airport from 12 noon until 10 pm and just imagine we have 3 kids with us and no any supervisor or no contact so we can asked whats really the problem. They just gave a 15 voucher and when they gave the fast food near to close and when they confirmed that the flight was cancelled for tomorrow they didnt gave us a free hotel accommodation and we even spent 200 for the hotel room. They dont even care about their passengers. Its the worst worst worst airlines and Im telling you all the passengers will not recommend this airlines and that will be our first and last flight with them. Kids got sick and me actually is sick due to stress fatigue and so so tired. Not Frontier again. You are worst.
I arrived 23 July without my luggage. It is already a week later and I still did not receive my lost luggage. No answers from the company. No response only seen that the luggage was booked in at Zurich airport and booked through to Windhoek. Value and nonreplaceable items of sentimental value were in my luggage. How do you replace items you bought on a onceinalifetime holiday for your family My chargers clothes etc. is not easy to replace. Never in my life again. It cost me a fortune to pay for the ticket from my hardearn money. Disgusting to say the least.
Lilongwe to London via Johannesburg. Wonderful airline to fly on the aeroplane is in great condition with so many wonderful things available to the customer. Staff are very attentive and would make any other top class airline shy with how they ensure professional attention. Food is great and tasty. Seats are a little small but okay.
Cartagena to Medellin. Lots of hidden extra charges at the counter totalling 270000.00. No indication that boarding passes need to be printed 2 hours before the flight so we were charged 65000 each for this privilege. Avoid avoid avoid
Doha to Bangkok was one of the best flights ever I had. I was already knowing the cabin of The Boeing 787 so the space was as usual pretty nice and ok. The food was really spicy and full of ingredients so I did not touch it too much. The cabin crew was really patient polite and they were really helpful in curating the details from each guests. It turne out that I forgot my amenity kit at home. As it was a night flight I asked a member from the cabin crew and she said there were not any available in economy anymore but she gave the chance to have one from Business class which I was just in love because of the Brics design. She was so polite and talented and she was just four months with Qatar Airways she really made my flight and all my 24h journey. I m pretty sure she will make a good job and these are the way to create proud and loyal customers.
I had the unfortunate pleasure of using Smart Wings to fly from Paris to Prague and from Prague to Milan this was to catch another flight from Milan to Rome and the service was terrible. Not only was the flight cancelled 4 weeks before the departure date even though it was booked 9 months in advance but then the only available flight was 9pm instead of 9am. This flight was then delayed by 2 hours. We were told at check in that it was delayed by 1 hour but no further announcement was made to inform us of the second hour delay. To compliment that the flight from Prague to Milan was cancelled all together but we only found out when we arrived for that flight. This caused us to miss a connecting flight and therefore saw us arrive in Rome 6 hours later than we should have.
Im used to fly with the french national airline because Im a toptier Frequence Plus cardholder but I have decided to try Air Austral on a trip from Reunion Island to Paris return in Business Class they call it Club Austral. I have not been disappointed. The onboard crew was extremely helpful and smiley from boarding to disembarking. The seat which can recline 140 degrees almost flat bed is very comfortable good width and pitch. The food is tasty and includes a creole dish accompanied with spicy condiments and an interesting variety of wines. Even the bread is warm unlike other airlines Im used to travel with. I have been especially impressed by the quality of the service on board and this from the FA to the captain. Good work.
Siem Reap to Hong Kong on Dragonair was fantastic. Although this is a singleclass aircraft we were treated like business class. A warm meal was served timely and in a most friendly manner. I must say this is airline will be high on my list when travelling in the region again.
Zurich to London City Airport. No real business class experience. The gate for this short haul flight was very unusually at Terminal E some additional 15 minutes away from the main terminal. Luckily I had only little hand baggage and had checked in online before otherwise I would have missed the flight. Boarding was rather chaotic no special lane for business class. The seats were okay but narrow and cramped. As it was an early morning flight we got hot breakfast with was disappointing in quantity and quality the fruit salad looked tired no muesli nor yoghurt. A disappointing experience but rather typical for flights to City Airport.
No meal for a 10 hour flight we had a huge delay 4 hours with no help from the company to take connecting flights horrible service and everything looked cheap and not taken care of. No information about the whereabouts of the aircraft or the whole waiting time was provided with time. Overall horrible experience personnel was nice though but the whole attendance and communication was a mess. Never happened with any other company and just offering an apology is not enough for losing 1 extra flight. Cebu Pacific is an unprofessional company.
AirAsia has no proper customer support and not able to reach customer care. They have bot AVA with limited options that cant resolve your issues. Due to cheap quality website I got duplicate ticket for same flight on same date. I raised a ticket and try to follow up with airasia.com in many ways but no luck.
I flew from Jakarta to Hong Kong on September 19 2019. The service was almost perfect. where the flight is very timely excellent service from the cabin crew wide space between seats. The only thing that is less comfortable in this aircraft is that entertainment on board still uses a remote system which makes operating the monitor more difficult than current full service airlines which almost all use a touch screen system. but for the whole I really recommend you to fly with Singapore Airlines.
I booked a flight with Vietnam Airlines before the covid crisis. As so many flights it got cancelled not their fault at all. They offered me a rebooking which I had to pay an additional fee for. Now they cancelled my second flight too and told me that I wont get any refund not even a voucher. This is unacceptable they keep my money make me pay a fee for a flight change and now keep that too.
Paris to Tokyo Haneda. Firstly the checkin counter in terminal 2E replaced the humans by machines. Im not against that organisation. But It was completely jam packed disorganised with just 5 or 6 assistant for nearly a thousand passengers. There were a dozen flights that took off at the same time than the one I flew on so you can imagine the situation in the checkin area with no other special dispositions. Secondly concerning the inflight experience the seat was ok legroom was correct in the average. However the catering was just revolting even if I was in economy class I expect a minimum quality and respect in passenger services this is a total fail for Air France. Actually plane foods are not very tasty but for instance on 5 star airlines such ANA I was able to finish my plate as you may imagine this wasnt the case at all this time. Regarding the entertainment system its easy to navigate in it the response is ok even if the touch sensibility is not really good. The bad point is on the movie selection which is very poor not on its quantity but on its quality again. I wont say a comment on the cabin attendant because the service quality can widely differ between them maybe a part of the french charm. All in all I didnt fly on Air France for nearly 10 years and it was a mistake to try again. The new ads and commercials are far from the true quality and are just a marketing strategy for an airline which is sinking.
1in check in they charged us unexpectedly 3K peso first time in domestic Philippines flight after more then 5 with other companiesnone proportional for check in luggage 20Kg Standard. 2 after check in and 2 approves bags of 7 Kg we have been stopped at boarding and charged for additional 2K. It was small laundry bags and the plane was empty I am very disappointed it is very not proportional first time some company do it to me There was no space issue They doubled our tickets cost it is our honeymoon we were very unpleased.
My wife and I checked in at Counter B03 and we were greeted by a very friendly staff today at about 5.20 pm. After verifying our tickets she even offered us a packet of peanuts that we love so much. We didnt ask for her name but we really want to thank her for the kind hospitality
Pathetic front desk impolite and worst staff experience at Mangalore airport. Feels like we are approaching a local bus station. Need to review change your staff or else continue having these arrogant rude staff. As a frequent flyer on other airlines I have never had this kind of experience.
Dubai to Doha in January 2017. Excellent ground services punctual departure from assigned gate. Travelling with my wife on business. Only minus point was that there was no bridge to the aircraft rather an oldstyle transfer bus. Staff was courteous on boarding. While on the aircraft take off and landing were smooth obviously the pilot was well trained Food served was a delicious chicken sandwich as well as beverages enough considering the flight time is about an hour. Inflight entertainment was on and used my own earphones. Overall a pleasant experience I would recommend to all
Yesterday my husband and I decided to to come home from Rome earlier than the scheduled time at 8pm. When I rang BA in London the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra. Onboard the flight the steward gave me hot water and milk so that I can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me. While waiting to get off the plane I had a wonderful conversation with the BA staff who are so pleasant. I love flying with BA and we will continue to do so. We have booked our flight with BA next year. Thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service.
I think this company exists only because it is abusing EU regulations by the letter. They even did not have a plane in site at time of go to gate. Did not bothered to announce the delay or to make sure the airport displays the delay. NO ANNOUNCEMENT in the airport. The data should have come from this company. Because of the 2 hours delay without any responsibility they decided it is cheaper to allocate the aircraft after check in is closed. I am pretty sure the hygiene on board is missing in action. And we had a fly proudly flying around with us all the way home. Useless delays total disrespect of the passengers constant overbookingoversold tickets no time for actually hygiene in the aircraft. An air pirate of the same type as Ryan Air. It is no wonder they are the sole remaining low costs around with multiple routes. It is not complicated to be profitable if you abuse your clients with regulations on your side. Everybody dreams of selling something they dont actually have. It is sad when this is a trip to your holiday. Isnt it Why do regulations help them How is it possible to not announce the flight delay until the passengers passed the gate Because of regulations. So lets change them for better. Do not protect such companies. Flight schedule is not to be taken as optional or a joke. I do not enjoy paying for mockery.
Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Haneda return In summary the service by the cabin crew on both sectors were impeccable and the details of the service on board was top notch. I flew 2 elderly passengers 1 wheelchair passenger and a 5yr old child. We were all well taken care of from the boarding point right to the moment we disembarked after the immigration office by ANA ground staff. Food selection is better than most airlines. Chair did not recline well but was sufficient. Cabin crew was extremely polite and was always visible in the cabin making sure every passenger was attended to. Upon arrival the baggage delivery was prompt and quick. On our return trip on of the passengers from my group was seated separately. However they went through all the trouble to assign us a seat together despite the full flight HND KUL. The service overall surpassed my expectations. I will always plan my trips on ANA in future where possible.
Bangkok to Seoul. We would like to express our appreciation to the cabin staff 24 November 2017. We had an issue with the television during the flight. Once we informed her she actively tried to coordinate with related people to solve the issue and keep us informed on the progress. Moreover she came to us and explained the safety demonstration personally. This shows great service as a cabin crew. We really appreciated her kindness and support.
London Gatwick to Naples. I have used Meridiana for this flight route a few times have never encountered problems and found the flight attendants very accomodating and in particular one ground attendant. I travelled with identity card and passport when I boarded the plane I realised I had lost my passport in one of the shops in the waiting area quite a distance away from the gate but it was too late for me to go back to where I thought I had lost the passport and so asked the attendant what I should do of course the only option was the lost property office but I would have to wait 24 hours for it to be handed in and as I was leaving the country it would be complicated. I was very upset with myself. I boarded the plane and before the door was closed for the flight to get ready for take off there the attendant appeared with my passport in hand. I cannot tell you how grateful I am to her caring enough. I dont know how she managed to find it but I would like to say thank you to Meridiana and their staff. Wonderful customer care.
Very satisfactory flight with British Airways from London to Bangkok. Was expecting the worst having read some of the reviews on here. I had one of the window seats where you dont have to climb over somebody to get out and this seat compared favourably with some of the higher ranked airlines as it offers excellent privacy. Everything from check in to departure was seamless and apart from the AVOD which is pretty dated everything else on board was very satisfactory.
Melbourne to Hong Kong via Bandar Seri Begawan. Great service at check in at Tullamarine then a bit of a search for what was a pretty basic lounge. Boarding was easy and the crew to BSB were fantastic. Meal was good and if you wanted anything they were there very quickly. We were staying overnight in BSB and were not told that we had to pay 5 each for a visa but at least we got a nice stamp in our passport. Flight from BSB was on an A320 and again very comfortable and great service. On return from Hong Kong to BSB the lounge at HK was excellent as was the business lounge at BSB. Crew on this flight also very good. Then again only 4 of us in business class. Boarding the 787 to Melbourne was a bit clumsy at the gate. Told by a passenger next to me who had been on the flight from London that my seat was broken and would not go flat. Found this to be true but in the end 3 crew members jumped all over it and got it sorted. The meals were good. Didnt miss the grog. While the crew seem to disappear they do respond quickly if you buzz them and nothing is too much trouble. Would definitely fly with them again.
Tirana to Milan. I will never use this airline again after being caught by the middle name change scam. You may have got 60 euros from us but you have lost our business forever. The flight was Tirana to Milan had no choice but to pay as had a connecting flight in Milan.
Kuala Lumpur to Sydney on lowfare ticket. Service was manic and disorganised often bordering on rude. For an 8 hour flight I wasnt offered a free glass of water. Essentially they know youre going to pay. Emailed them with some feedback and took them more than 6 weeks to reply. Pay the extra and fly with an airline that actually has some thought about their passenger.
I am disappointed about everything inside this trip. There is not enough space between the seats. The services are awful almost nothing is included inside the plane. There was some food but very little not even water there are not providing you if you require additional. There is no free entertainment you have to pay for everything. I have flown with many companies along the last 14 years but this was one of my worst experience that I had.
EWRYUL late evening flight. The 45seat CRJ200 was halfempty so I managed to get two seats to myself. It still does feel very tight though. The overhead bins wont even take a smaller backpack and the seats are very confining in terms of personal space plus you really cant see out of the window due to its low position. There was a single FA serving the flight which she managed with grace and efficiency even with a drink run and some small snacks served. The service in general is OK but to spend more than an hour aboard the CRJ would be a torture.
DMEKJA with IKTDME return business class. Used British Airways Avios points to get business class to Siberia and back. Outbound flight left late due to connecting passengers. Return flight ontime. Service prompt and professional and food much better than I expected. FA in both directions spoke reasonable English and even smiled. No IFE but that is not very important to me.
I have flown with Meridiana operated by Air Italy from Milan to Mauritius and back. Before the flight I tried several times to contact their Call Center to make a seat reservation their own Call Center told me several times that the flight is made by Air Italy and that they cannot reserve a seat in such case this is a lie They are the same company Air Italy is a subsidiary of Meridiana and after several months of calling there I was able to make a seat reservation. Second impression I had was at my seat in the plane. I couldnt believe that the right armrest of the seat is broken and taped up. Service during the flight was at beginning and before landing 015 dcl of water juice etc for a 11 hours flight a great deal They served also something what they call dinner. I tried it taste was terrible. Service has been all the time very reserved without a indication of a smile or interest of passenger. Other thing is how they are dealing with the seat reservations shortly before the flight and onboard. They have tried to change my paid seat to another but they didnt have any aisle seat available so I disagreed. Later on board I could see a big chaos because more than 20 people have had the same seats assigned this was probably caused by the fact that 80 have got the seat on Madagaskar and the rest on Mauritius plane was going through Madagaskar to Mauritius and in 2 hours back. Also thanks to this chaos we arrived back in Milan with more than 1 hour delay. Overall not an airline I can recommend.
The worst services are offered by this airline. They would delay your flights so do not look for connection flights through this airline as you would miss it. The staff are the rudest of all this includes the air hostess and the staff on the airport. I missed my next connection flight to Winnipeg due to the flight being delayed 3 hours. Make sure to at least get your food coupon what you are entitled to as they wont tell you about it at the Care Point.
Hong Kong to Hangzhou. Very poor service with no clear explanation for flight delay. This airline always delays one flight with fewer customers in order not to delay other flights with more customers. For example the flight from Hong Kong to Hangzhou Flight number KA622 is frequently delayed for 34 hours due to airlines poor operations of flight schedules but not because of weather conditions.
Seoul to Jakarta. Quite attentive service One of the friendliest and most courteous stewardesses. Plane seemed a bit old. Their screen is old and definitely need upgrade. Food quality is amazing.
Adelaide to Melbourne. Staff were lazy and unhelpful. They appeared more interested in selling extras and assessing baggage weight than providing service. While nobody expects luxury from a budget airline courtesy shouldnt be dependent on ticket price.
Singapore to Kuching and I love the new uniform the SilkAir crew is wearing. I requested to change my seat and the ground staff at Changi Airport T2 helped me without much fuss. 4star service from cabin crew the inflight entertainment is pretty good. Works well on my iPhone 5c. Fair amount of entertainment considering SilkAir only operate short haul flights. Food was fine. Overall I still recommend SilkAir to others.
My family and I flew on Garuda Indonesia on GA089 from Amsterdam to Jakarta on June 25th 2022. Garuda Indonesia informed us one day prior to checkin that we should go directly the VIP Center at Schiphol airport and that they would handle all our checkin requirements. This turned out to be outstanding as it was seamless from entering the VIP center until they took us to board the plane and avoided all the long queues going through security. This was a great service that Garuda afforded us and was much appreciated. After takeoff were we provided with a selection of meals when the food arrived as each was prepared by the Chef onboard it was very well presented and tasted even better. We had two full meals onboard and the cabin crew were available and kept coming around asking if we need anything else. The cabin crew were every attentive to me my wife and two children. Nothing was able bother for them and they always greeted us with a reassuring heart warming smile. We had a minor problem with our IFE system in two seat however we had been informed prior to boarding however this was not an issue as we always bring our own LaptopsiPads etc. I would rate the overall service as excellent and would like to thank the cabin crew for their help and assistance to me and my family they certainly made us feel at home. Upon arrival in Jakarta were we met at the gate by the ground support team who escorted us through immigration and customs. Garuda had also provided us with ground transportation to take us to our home. Thank you Garuda Indonesia.
Ipoh to Johor Bahru. Flight departure time at 3.40pm from Ipoh was delayed for few hours even by 6.00pm they unable to provide the reason for delay and expecting time for the flight. Almost 2 hours and they just provide a bottle of water for the passenger.
No complaints about the seats. Row 1 with lots of space for a fair price. Inbound flight had a delay of 4 hours. No compensation of any kind because the European compensation rules do not apply to Corendon Airlines Turkey. Comfort and staff are fine. Nevertheless first time and last time unless I am 100 sure the flight will be operated by Corendon Dutch Airlines.
An airline that no longer offers the services we were used to. At departure due to the delays that are already common with them I hardly got the connection. But the luggage did not reach the destination. We had to make a 700 km round trip the next day to retrieve them. On the return they were late and 4 of the 6 bags arrived destroyed and at the complaints office I found out that this is something common with this company. The compensation process for the 4 bags is not completed after a month the company trying all kinds of situations in order not to compensate. I am asking for invoices from luggage invoice or paper from a luggage repair company that cannot be repaired. I do not recommend this company.
Osaka to Vladivostok. Second time to fly S7 very good experience from checkin to boarding timeprocedure and flight itself. Checkin was smooth boarding was quick and efficient. The aircraft was new the legroom was decent and the snack offered inflight surprisingly good. Total flight time was about 2h we landed 20 minutes earlier than scheduled. Overall high marks for S7.
This journey was 6 legs long with Air Astana. SaintPetersburg to Almaty from Almaty to UstKamenogorsk and back Almaty to Aktobe and back and finally from Almaty to SaintPetersburg. If my trip from LED to ALA is usual thing almost two times a year but my new discovery was domestic flight KC863864 from Almaty to Aktobe. Oh my god even choice of hot meal dish. Other stuff just have to mention clean cabin perfect meal each way. I also had my air astanas mug I got last year. Its capacity is about 400 ml and asked to fill it up with coffee no problem sure I heard the answer My flight from UstKamenogorsk was delayed but I got notification by email 4 hours before departure so I was still at home. 6 flights and only one delay. I think its good factor. overall everywhere I saw attentive staff helpful managers and perfect service.
My husband and I were very comfortable and happy with everything about Breeze Airways. Our flights took off and landed on time flight attendants were very professional and kind. Will definitely fly Breeze again.
Nadi to Suva. I fly domestically a lot and dont usually feel the need to post reviews but I just had to with this one. So when I got to the airport I saw a lady dressed in Fiji Links cabin crew uniform. At first thought I said to myself How could she be a cabin crew and what could she possibly have to offer but I was wrong. I was seated in Row 1 which means I board first and from the first to the last passenger she did a head count and found 10 passengers to be missing now here is where she won me. She went out leaving the Junior Cabin Crew on board with the passengers and looked for the 10 passengers who were still clearing immigration after arriving late from LAX. First and foremost it was a very rare sighting I have never seen a flight attendant go out of hisher way to look for passengers so they dont miss their flight. I was a little annoyed with the 30 minutes delay but the way she handled it was marvelous once she came in and closed the doors and went over the PA Ladies and gentleman I sincerely thank you for your patience yes thats right she thanked us instead of generically apologising at that moment all my annoyance was gone. . Even while disembarking she treated everyone with respect.
Probably one of the worst airlines to travel. They called me 2 hours before my flight to inform me that my flight is canceled when I was on my way to the airport and upon asking for refund they told they wont be giving me my partial refund for the flight that got cancelled by the airline. Id honestly request everyone not to ever ever travel through GoAir.
San Francisco to Kolkata via Dubai. Dubai happens to be a great midpoint between San Francisco and India and is also a nice city. I have flown many times with Emirates business class from SFO to India via Dubai. however my last flight with them in September was the worst and that is what this review is about. Really bad food on the flights so much so that for much of the flight I stayed hungry. I am not particularly finicky about food. This is not an issue with Dubai to India shorter flight but a real issue for SFO to DXB. On this occasion I swapped my Business class seat with my wifes economy class. Extremely rude staff started an argument whether I can visit my wife in business class. This was lodged as a complaint with Emirates but I did not hear anything in the last 3 months. So rude staff and ineffective management that does nothing even on feedback. Wife was pregnant and unwell threw up on the flight in the Business class seat and requested that I be called from the economy section for a few minutes. The confused staff bumbled around for a few minutes and did nothing.
Worst airline ever. Leg room so poor I could not sit without knees crushed into seat ahead I am 173m tall. Staff surly and uninterested unless downright rude shouting at clients. Never again
Melbourne to Athens via Doha. What an amazing airline. It is such a relief to have our tickets refunded. We were supposed to be in Greece right now instead we are confined to our home in Melbourne. Qatar acted fairly and empathetically and refunded our money.
This airline has all the hallmarks of an airline emerging from bankruptcy. From the no inflight meals to the excess fees boarding pass fees to the glitchy online checkin process all the way down to their water bottle policies. Before my flight they said the water limit is 100ml which everyone knows is basically one sip of water. Clearly this was intended to make you purchase inflight water. So I had to throw away two entire bottles of water because of terrible corporate policies. Someone is gonna have to answer alot of questions on the day of judgment when they are asked about how much water they wasted for money. Also why do they have so many flight attendants if they arent serving food and trying to boost revenue after emerging from bankruptcy Classic corporate mismanagement across every level. Rock hard seats poor technology terrible fee policies everything about my experience was sour.
Had a bit of issue with my original flight with Air France from Amsterdam to Shanghai via Paris so I had to pay additional fee to be rebooked to another flight 4 days later than my original travel plan out of London. I was sold a flight that I couldnt use given that I wasnt aware that to change flight within Schengen countries that I would need a visa on my Chinese passport Although it is passengers responsibility to verify travel documents requirements it would be helpful if airlines remind their passengers such requirements I paid for a business class upgrade and that was gone too. So I was 4 days behind my travel plan and 370 upgrade gone and I had to pay another 240 to rebook my flight The AF UK helpline staff were defensive on the phone and the first one I spoke to told me that I needed to pay for a whole new ticketI had to use Twitter to get a sensible solution to my problem rather than speak to someone on the phone. At my departure date when I got to Heathrow checkin desk staff were just going through the motions. I couldnt checkin online on my rebooked flight so I couldnt chose my seat and was given a seat that I wasnt happy with and again had to use twitter. it seems that Twitter is the best way to contact Air France when you have issues. AF twitter account changed my seat for the CDG to PVD flight before my London to Paris flight took off. The transfer time in Paris was a bit tight. When my flight from London touched down it was already boarding time for the PVG flight and I had to rush to catch the connection flight. They had changed my seat to be next to a mother and her young daughter. I like kids in general but it was clear that they needed all 3 seats and luckily there were 4 empty seats in a nearby row and I moved there. I didnt understand why AF couldnt give me that seat in the first place. The service was minimal I wasnt expecting much for economy but it was very basic.
I flew from Gatwick to Rome and back on holiday and was pleasantly surprised by the standard of food and service. The salad on the outward flight was exceptional and the steward on the return leg in a nearfull cabin was anticipating what passengers might want. BA food baffles me. Ive flown First a few times in the past few years and the food was so bad I thought BA should pay compensation as well as refunding the flight ticket. In Business it is usually OK. The only letdown this time was the lounge at Gatwick. It was like a Ryanair holding pen.
Pune to Abu Dhabi flight scheduled for 19th March cancelled without any notice. Received a curt email saying flight is cancelled. Did not give any alternative option. Had to call up Call Center and after a hold time of 30 mins was told that options available were only with 10 hour layovers. Wouldnt recommend Jet Airways to anyone again
The crew were lovely but the baggage service is very poor. We were offered to check in our cabin luggage which we were grateful but until now 7 weeks later still not deliveredarrivedmissing other luggage were late delivered and still waiting for 3 more Do not be deceived with more kg luggage that you can bring It will not comeback to you and worst no communication from Saudi Airlines despite of our thousand emails and calls
I have never had the experience ever like this evening. The flight was extremely full with seating uncomfortable but this is not the main complaint. On landing they start disembarking from front and from back to front saying that the back passengers has to disembark to balance the plane. These passengers push past with luggage bumping and pushing to the front. I have in my entire lifetime of flying Never heard about this balancing and have never experienced it on any flight both local and international ever. This meant that passengers sitting on the wing were disembarked last and ended being pushed with the abuse of passengers and hand luggage on an already full plane sitting down. Yes so this at eye level. I am super disappointed at Flysafair tonight. Would not consider this as first choice next time flying
Business class in a LAN Airlines Boeing 787 from Frankfurt to Madrid. Although they dont have a lounge in Frankfurt we were able to use the new Air Canada lounge. There wasnt any lack of good food all kinds of drinks and entertainment. The same in Madrid using the Iberia one. Onboard the staff were taking care of all our requests. We were served a welcoming drink pisco or sparkling wine a very light salad and smoked ham with some of the best chilean wines. The pilot gave information about the flight landing times connection flights and so on. I must say I had the opportunity to fly them from Santiago to Easter island 2 months later in the same aircraft but this time economy and all I could say it was that except the food which was average not the wine and Cafe Juan Valdez the experience was same as pleasent as the business one.
Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. Excellent experience from checkin to arrival. I was surprised by the high quality of the meal for a 2hr flight. Good entertainment was also available. If you fly Vietnam Airlines business class I recommend that you try to select a widebody flight such as A350 or B787. My past experience with their A32x business class is way below this standard although it might be worth the price just for the airport experience if you are departing from Hanoi or Saigon.
This short flight was great. There is no IFE and you have to pre order or buy your food. Food is in small portion and high prized. The crew is very friendly and very professional. Of course Boeing 787 is great but you have to pay for plugging in your electronic equipment unless you are in Biz. They provide paid WiFi unless you are in Biz but is slow that is worthless.
London to Bangkok. Its not what it used to be but most importantly it does not deliver what it promises any longer. Disappointing food outdated and uncomfortable seats appalling baggage handling at LHR and mediocre crew service onboard. The customer service online is just as bad. My most recent experience was early January 2020 when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in Club World on an overnight flight from LHR to BKK. Baby screams could not sleep and as the cabin was full they could not move me. The couple was very nice apologetic and we just had to bear the 12 hours long haul flight together. However my dealings with customer service was appalling. When is BA going to offer a kids free zone in Club World for people who need to work or sleep
Check in and service at the airport pure disaster to Lounge. Almost no staff 2 counters only for premium check in. Pure chaos and no staff Staff prefer to hug known passengers and chat with them. Premium looks different. Check in und Service am Flughafen reine Katastrophe bis Louge. Fast kein Personal 2 Schalter nur fur Premium Check in. Chaos pur und kein Personal Personal umarmt lieber bekannte Passagiere und quatscht mit denen. Premium sieht anders aus.
I would like to say Thank you to all flight attendants in Flight HU7976 Jan. 24th 2021 from Toronto to Xian. Thank you all for your kind service yesterday the service has been outstanding Thanks for your warm smiles even though with mask and cheerful greetings. Thanks for being ready to keep us safe in this special pandemic moments. We all know this is a difficult and turbulent time for many airline industry this is also a big challenge for those flight attendants to provide service with their space suit and mask during the long distance trip. Keep up the good work and be safe.
It was a good flight and the cabin crew was friendly and will try to help you if you have a question. It was an A320 without entertainment. I remember having more leg space in the A320s from Vueling lowcost than I had with Brussels Airlines.
The worst simply the worst. Flight attendants do not provide any service at all. Their info online contradicts what employees in airport are implementing. Headphones have an old plug so nothing fits but cheapest given. No human approach no compassion no apologies. Just everyone feels you owe them not the opposite. Bumped me with the child to next day regardless of the info online them stick me in the last row seat since I gave them trouble plus I did not have any time to purchase new seats for the next flight. Connection was 5 hrs when tickets were initially purchased at the flight time became 17 hrs layover. Cheapest in everything.
I have purchased tickets to fly from Amsterdam to Ibiza. TUI officially announced in media that no flights will be cancelled everything looked good until the last moment when I suddenly got an email that my flight got moved to Liege different country 270km away. The flight was schedule on 6.20 morning Saturday so because I worked on Friday evening and there is totally no night transportation between Amsterdam and Liege there was no way for me to get to Liege. I have called TUI and a very polite lady told me that indeed there is no other way but to cancel the tickets and she can do it for me. I asked her to be sure if the funds will be transferred back to my account she confirmed I got credit note and cancellation bill and thats the moment when the show begins. The email on their website doesnt work when after an hour waiting you finally get someone on the phone they send you to chat after days of waiting for answer on messenger the tell you to call with a smiley on twitter they say that it is busy and I probably received the money because system says 0 so basically their approach is We have your money and what can you do
Air Botswana to and from Johannesburg and Maun. The staff were friendly and outward journey JNBMain was fine. The return journey was chaos To start with the checkin at Maun airport was chaotic. The lounge was completely full of passengers trying to check in. Air Botswana had chartered another aircraft and upon boarding some passengers had no seats so they were told that they would have to catch the next flight. Once aboard they told us that the aircraft couldnt take our bags and that they would be in JNB on the next flight apparently 2 hours later. I was connecting with a flight to Europe and if I had known that earlier I could have labelled my bag accordingly and I might have tried to check my bag through the whole way. I felt sorry for the staff as they were polite and tried hard to appease the passengers. They couldnt take the bags for safety reasons which is fair enough. The problem was that they knew this before we boarded the aircraft and chose to tell us once we were aboard. We flew via Gabarone to refuel. Then in Johannesburg a representative met us at the luggage carousel and told us that our bags would arrive tomorrow At least he was there when our flight arrived and not when the supposed next flight was meant to arrive 2 hours later. However that was a bit of a shock for some of the passengers as Air Botswana must have known this in Maun. He took down all our details and where we wanted our bags sent if we werent staying in Johannesburg. I honestly didnt expect to see my bag again. Three days later at home in Spain an Air Botswana rep phones me and asks me which airport in Spain I want my bag sent to Zaragoza is 1.5 hours drive away and the nearest airport. My bag arrived there 2 days later. If any other airline flew between Main and Johannesburg I would try them. I think Air Botswana needs some competition
Booked through BA. Cancelled flight a couple of hours before flight by email. Email said clearly choice is to rebook or claim a refund within 7 days. Tried to claim a refund and they said down to adverse weather so doesnt qualify. Not a cloud in the sky. Absolutely totally untrustworthy. Pay a few quid more and go with a proper airline. Cant believe British Airways thrown their lot in with this shower.
Jakarta to Amsterdam via Medan. The ground experience was very smooth in Jakarta The flight was excellent even though it was slightly longer due to rerouting via Saudi and Egypt due to the recent Iranian incident. Two meals were served dinner and breakfast and snacks were available through out the flight I was tired therefore I opted to sleep. My seat was very comfortable and I slept for 7 hours. The breakfast was delicious with the onboard Chef adding his personal touch. The cabin crew were extremely friendly and provided an excellent service. WiFi was available on the Medan to Amsterdam flight.
I had to cancel my flight due to Covid positive results 24hr before the flight. Everything was going well at the beginning when we cancelled the flightticket because we have been informed that they will refund. However after almost 40 days I have been informed that Copa Airlines will not refund. This action is not fair at all.
British Airways is a very good airline. Yesterday I was coming back from Bangkok to London and I missed my flight because I feel asleep at the airport I had a sleepless night and food poisoning. They did me big favour and booked next available flight next day free of charge. Never happened to me with another airline. Very impressed.
Highly disappointed with the service. My flight back and fro both very bad. The inflight entertainment system doesnt work. The crew doesnt understand English and doesnt want to help. All they say is its a problem for everyone why are you complaining and say that they cant do anything about it. I would never recommend this Airline to anyone. I opted for Asian meal veg meal which had rice potatoes half cooked and black beans the taste was awful.
London to Sao Paulo with TAM Airlines. Left London on time. Cabin staff very helpful and plane clean and comfortable. Food served for dinner and breakfast ok although only 1 alcoholic drink offered with dinner. VOD worked with latest films and water offered during the night. Arrived on time at Sao Paulo and then disaster struck eventually informed after 1 hour wait that onward flight to Santiago would not be departing at 7.30am but 10pm. After walking around the airport and queueing for 2 hours and retrieving luggage we were eventually given vouchers for a taxi to dump of a hotel on the outskirts of Soa Paulo. Stuck there all day no leisure facilities industrial buildings surrounding the hotel and having to arrange hotel shuttle bus back to airport. Have several more flights booked with TAM Airlines on package holiday to South America so just hope things improve
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. Horrible experience with the worse checkin experience I have had waiting one hour and forty minutes. BKK airport is very modern I used it tens of times before and never had to wait more than normal. The excess luggage was frightfully expensive on a domestic flight I paid nearly 3 times my air fare staff was of no help. Onboard it was decent.
This City jet flight was operated for Air France. After arriving with an Air France flight in Paris from Singapore this Paris to Dublin flight was a big letdown compared to the service with an actual Air France flight. First of all after everyone has boarded their system recorded an error in their reservation . Simply bizarre that they only discovered this after letting everyone on board. This resulted in the plane not even moving from where it was parked for about 50 minutes after scheduled departure. We were then moving practically all over the airport for what seemed like they wanted us to view the runways before the plane actually took off. Service on board was quite slow. After being served the meal it seemed like they did not feel the need to clear the tray tables quickly. One stewardess managed to splash some CocaCola on the lady sitting beside me. She was very apologetic and nice but I got the impression that she was under pressure. On arrival in Dublin my bagage which had a priority tag after arriving in Paris on a first class flight was the 85th bagage to come out While Air France has consistently maintained high standards it appears that their City Jet partner just could not be bothered to do the same. As a result I missed the noon direct bus to Limerick and ended up having to use another bus company that took 3 hours and 45 minutes and a very convoluted route to get to Limerick. After spending so much to get priority service this connecting flight was a big disappointment and is way way below the service of an Air France operated flight.
I flew from Salalah Oman to Frankfurt via Doha with Qatar Airways. The flight to Doha was operated with a A320. It was a very empty flight. There was no entertainment system on board but you had 15 min of free WiFi. They served very tasty food and drinks. The seat wasnt so comfortable because you didnt have much space. The transfer at Hamad Airport was fast. The flight to Frankfurt was operated with a A350900 from LATAM Airlines. The Services was great but the snack and the breakfast was only okay. There was no WiFi and the entertainment system is not as good as on Qatar Airways own aircrafts. The seats were good and you had enough legroom including a footrest. So all in all it was two good flights but I was disappointed that the LATAM aircraft was not as comfortable as Qatars A350.
Antananarivo to Johannesburg. This is the worst airline I have used. The two flights I booked with them were both canceled on the day of the flight. One was canceled due to mechanical problems on the plane only after everyone had boarded and was replaced by another flight 12 hours later. The other an international flight to Johannesburg was canceled with no explanation. We were told that the next flight wasnt for a full week thereafter which would have caused us to miss our international flight back to the US. The customer service agent could only offer me a call center email address for requesting a refund. When I did so they told me they could only process the refund through my travel agent but I had booked the tickets myself on the Internet Canceling a flight and not refunding it is called stealing.
London to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. I have not flown yet my flight is next weekend and want to know why my flight has not been cancelled My flight transits through Rome and Abu Dhabi before landing in Melbourne. Rome is in lockdown due to COVID19 and the UAE has closed its borders meaning you cant transit through Abu Dhabi anymore. Furthermore the FCO has advised against all but essential travel so this is utterly baffling I am not happy as I expect this flight to be cancelled and given a full refund.
This was the worst trip experience I ever had. I first of all kept getting pushed back because my covid result never came on time then advised me to get a rapid test. My final destination was Douala and they didnt let me get on because I had a rapid test. They took us to go get the test but had us wait for an hour just to tell us it was closed. Since I had no more boarding pass I couldnt go upstairs and was with my daughter .. no food and no change in currency. They wanted my daughter and I to sleep there they didnt even have plugs for our phones. I didnt have food or anything and my daughter was tired and hungry. I became irritated and wanted to call the U.S embassy since I am in the military. The lady then negotiated for me and I got a choice to take the ticket back to the US. I finally flew back home lost my voucher spent money for nothing and they lost two of my luggage. This was the worst travel experience I ever had including customer service for the most part.
I took Qatar Airways on the Manila Istanbul Manila route via Doha a total of 4 different flights and had a very good experience. Ground staff lounge staff and on board crew always took extra the step to make my journey better. All flights departed and arrived on time. Food and Beverage options were excellent on board as well in the lounges. My only negative comment might be on boarding practices in Manila. There is a boarding card and passport check prior to entering boarding gate which is same as everywhere else. After this scanning the boarding card before boarding the aircraft which is also same but there is one more person only who checks the boarding card on the link bridge and finally the on board crew. I do not think it is necessary to perform 4 different checks. This also causes a long queue on the link bridge.
Im unhappy with the traveling with MAS. Originally on our ticket the flight was leaving at 2150 then a notice via email on the same day at 1800 stating that there was a flight delay and would be leaving 1 hour later making It 22.50 departure there was no explanation of why there was a delay or alteration in time. For the flight to Melbourne to KL also alteration in time. Our initial flight was to leave Melbourne at 1510 but was informed and changed to 1410 one hour earlier on 1st Feb 2023 again with no explanation given to why there was an alteration. We have done online check in both in Melbourne and Kuala Lumpur however there is no special counter for those online check in. We have to queue up for more than 1.5 hours in Melbourne even though we have done online check in. I asked the MAS officer why we still have to queue up in line despite having checked in online. She had no idea and said the customer just had to queue up even though had checked in online. During the flight I found that some cabin crew were rude and impatient. Our seats were 17K and 17H. The stewardess had no friendly greetings when it came to serving the food and refreshments. My food was not of a good quality and did not taste very nice. There was one dish that was supposedly a pizza but there was no way to hold it and no cutlery given to eat it with it was stuck to the packaging it came in. My friend asked the stewardess about this and she said to use a serviette it was so sticky and was stuck to the box and I had to use my hand. The fruit dish was not fresh and tasteless and the coffee was not pleasant. The baggage claim had to wait around 1 hour waiting for luggage.
Fantastic airline with the best customer service ever I had to change my travel plan at the last moment I call the customer care and they change all my flights between the islands without charging anything. It took few minutes I received the new flight plans immediately.
Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. This was the first time choosing this company and it was just great. Everything was efficient since I entered the airport. Staff was warm welcoming and helpful. The seat was not the best but still comfy enough. Food was great bearing in mind it was a short haul. Nice presentation of the food. On the way from Hong Kong our plane broke so we had to wait for another one. However the staff took care of us very efficiently. I was very impressed and will fly with them again if possible.
Flew from London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi. Honestly they were really good legroom great crew excellent looked after us superbly food and drinks were bang on did Vegas in April too nowt wrong with this airline.
Taipei to Vancouver. Very comfortable product. Seat and food excellent especially for a long total journey after transit in TPE. Service attentive but not over the top. Drinks a little limited but pleasant enough. Inflight WiFi fast and TPE lounge generally comfortable too although did start to get a bit crowded.
Bristol to Larnaca. A320 of Smartlynx Airlines painted in Thomas Cook colours. 2 hours late leaving Bristol the luggage was on board but apparently the computer had deleted it off the system. The luggage had to be unloaded and matched up to the passengers then loaded again. Seat the most uncomfortable I have ever sat in crammed in like sardines. No hot water on the flight so no tea or coffee also ran out of ice halfway through the trip. Cabin crew were very pleasant but oddly had a rest break halfway through the flight. I will not fly on this airline again if I can help it.
Munich to Singapore via Paris. The transit time is only one hour The first flight is even delayed. Customer isnt very friendly. If you can choose other airlines to avoid transit in Paris dont choose Air France.
This airline is getting worse. Since COVID hit their prices skyrocketed and the service got worse. Flights delayed and caused nightmare for connection passengers. Most of staff cant speak proper English. The airline charges extra for wifi service which never works.
Stuttgart to Split. The flight was great. We did the Check In online so when we arrived at the airport we immediately went thru the security check and then to the gate. Boarding went smoothly and the seats were okay the same as Eurowings. We had a delay because of the Thunderstorm but that was ok. We didnt pay much money for the tickets about 60. The crew was nice. I flew with my hand luggage because I heard many people had problems with their suitcases with Laudamotion so I would recommend flying with only hand luggage.
Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu. It was quite an enjoyable flight. Cabin crew and ground service were very friendly. After takeoff there were served a welcome drink. The food was just normal. It was a cake or something. The seat was quite comfortable too as the aircraft is just 1 year old. Ive been on Malindo Air two times once was Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Overall I still recommend this airline. Its cheap and well serviced.
Amsterdam to Belgrade. This company is terrible I booked the ticket for my mom to visit me in Los Angeles. She had a flight back from LAX to AMS and then in Amsterdam she just received a text that her flight to Belgrade operated by Air Serbia was canceled without any further notice for more than 24h. She is an older lady with a high blood pressure stuck in the airport without hotel provided or anything else. After more than 24h of me calling and my family we arranged another flight for her not Air Serbia and finally she is back home safe and sound. Dont ever travel on Air Serbia they dont care about their passengers.
Worst experience ever. Our flight was delayed at checkin. No reason given. No information on how we will be accommodated when we miss our connecting flight. Staff were terrible. My flight experience was terrible.
San Francisco to Mumbai via Beijing. Flight was delayed. They put me on a Lufthansa flight. I had purchased the ticket for 410 usd and paid 166 usd for an extra baggage. However since they changed my flight to Lufthansa I had to pay the Lufthansa extra baggage charges which was 287 usd. More than half my ticket price. When I emailed Air China and requested a refund of 166 usd plus the extra charges I had to pay to Lufthansa beyond the 166 usd I received no reply to the email. I received a refund of the 166 usd I had paid them. This is unethical business conduct and bad customer service
London Heathrow to Dubai in British Airways First Class. The trip got off to a good start with the Concorde lounge at Terminal 5. Very comfortable and private however showing signs of wear and tear. Needs a bit of a refurb. Boarding was announced and we promptly left however only just made it to the gate. Very odd but I am no fan of the trains to the strange satellite terminals for boarding. The plane was a very old refurbished Boeing 747400. Quite why BA hangs on to these gas guzzlers is a mystery. I estimate the plane over its life so far has done about 90 million miles enough to get to the moon. Much criticism has been said about cramming so many First suites into the nose of the plane and I can say that is fully justified. It was a day flight so not worried about sleeping but if it were a night flight as a tall but not overweight man I would struggle to get comfortable. Its like a coffin and storage space for personal effects not worth a light. A cabin crew told me they will hang on to the newer Boeing 747400s for another 510 years. If so this is truly unbelievable. Given the Emirates competition on this route their fantastic suites and they always serve caviar one does wonder if the sales and marketing people at British Airways have a clue how to entice customers to the overall experience. There is so much criticism of British Airways on this site one wonders why they dont listen. It can only be perceived as arrogance. Food was fine. Very nice mezza nice soup and spicy Middle Eastern style chicken not bad at all. Champagne very basic and Krug has long vanished from British Airways routes. Cabin crew were terrific faultless. Travelling a Boeing 777 on the way back. Hopefully a better seat.
Amman to Dubai. As I landed to Amman airport I had to run to be on time for my next fly at first I came to the wrong gate because on the screen it wasnt even shown this fly so the employee of the airportkindly show me the way where I need to go and it was totally different side of the airport and he informed me that the boarding is mostly closed. Finally I see my gate and the boarding dont even start. I see in the scream delayed for 30 min after 30 min still no information and again we see delay for 1.hour. In the end we get in after 2 hours no explanation or apology i find my seat and there was no space very uncomfortable seats. A passenger In front of me put his seat back while the flight was about to take off not even one cabin Crew notice it. The staff was very rude and unprofessional and very dirty toilet
I used to travel with my family incl. children on a regular basis from Geneva Switzerland to Tashkent and we are particularly satisfied with the quality of booking and ground services we receive from Uzbekistan Airways in Geneva as well with the flight conditions in general on this route.
Koyro PEKFNJ Ilyushin IL62. The inflight product was great however their safety standards are in need of international review no cabin crew jump seats are provided they hang on to assist handles in the galley curtains are drawn for takeoff and landing exits blocked with service carts no cabin baggage storage checks and the safety demo is a seat belt only. Also pax are assigned exits to use in an emergency depending on where they are seated and Im sure the FAs will want to see your boarding pass as you jump down the canvas apron slide
I had a direct flight for my son scheduled on the 25th of June which was cancelled and I tried several times to contact them to change the date for a different flight. The customer services was very poor and they had an unprofessional language and approach. Finally I managed to change the flight for my son for the 2nd July a direct flight as well. It was impossible to find on their website the information regarding the documents needed for a child to travel with them so I had multiple conversations over the phone with them to make sure we have all the documentation needed for check in and there will not be any problem before. Their also requested a fee for special assistance as my son was under age. Everything was paid and added to my sons ticket priority boarding luggage and the special assistance. With two days before the flight to be due I have received an email saying that the flight schedule is changed due to operational reasons and the flight will have a commercial stop at Bucharest and there will be a six hours stay between the flights. I accepted that even if the 3 hours flight became now 11 hours flight. On the 2nd July my son grandparents took him to the Cluj Napoca airport a four hours journey for them. They went to the check in office to do the checks and his grandfather asked them what is going to happen in Bucharest because there are 6 hours between the next flight and if is someone to look after my son in all this time. They realised there is a mistake and actually they dont have staff to look after my son in airport and they contacted Bucharest for an opinion. After two hours of stress for me as a mother and my son they refused to board him on the plane because they had no staff to look after him even if the service was added on his ticket. I tried myself to contact the airport from Bucharest but at 10 pm was nobody there and impossible to reach someone over the phone. Also they dont have opening hours over the weekend. This is ridiculous They created a big drama for my family and myself offering services which they cannot comply. I
Sharjah to Mumbai. Air India Express is less concerned about customer importance. Their flight delays very often. Never had any issue with other airlines but this one is very risky. They keep on rescheduling and keep on sending text messages and were made to wait for flight. Overall I would say. This flight not at all suitable for emergency and well planned trips.
Sydney to Tokyo via Hong Kong. Terrible customer service. Changed my flight to an unacceptable flight with many hours of stopover requiring me to pay for accomodation and miss 2 days of my trip. Refused to offer any help in organising a more appropriate flight.
Vancouver to Delhi via Shanghai. Worst experience ever first delayed baggage then missing items from my baggage. Locks got changed and the staff have no clue how this happened. I feel there is improvement needed in communication gap. I wish I could talk to someone who can at least understand English. Tickets are cheap and so is the service. I would never ever recommend this airline to anyone. Claim department is useless doesnt even cooperate since all they care if I knew Chinese.
We had a flight from Brussels to Vancouver with a change in Frankfurt. Normally we would board in Vancouver 4th of June at 11am to start a cruise. Our flight in Brussels had a delay of 70 minutes so we missed our connection in Frankfurt. Still on the plane taxiing to the gate we received an email that our flight to Vancouver was rebooked to Monday 5th June that was not ok because the cruise started on the 4th. At the customer desk after a waiting time of 90 minutes the lady was very rude she gave us a flight with a stopover in Chicago and a theoretical arrival in Vancouver on the 4th at 11h 33am. That was too late by no means we could arrive on time to board our cruise ship 11am. The lady was constantly pointing her watch to make clear that her shift was over she only spent 10 minutes to solve our problem. She threw the new flight schedule on the desk turned around and went away. I was totally in shock. In our life we have made a lot of travels to all kind of continents and with all kind of carriers. Never never were we treated in such a brutal disrespectful manner. We took a train back home a sad ending of our dream cruise. I would not recommend travelling with Lufthansa.
My wife and I who are both 76 travelled yesterday from Amritsar to New Delhi on the 10.15 flight no. 694. The service given to us was excellent and we would particularly like to commend the staff onboard and on check in.
We have been trying to get our tickets refunded since June always told to call back or wait for a call. Now were told no refunds only credit. Ok but guess what Same story Wait for us to call you or call back in a week. Never ever hear from them and literally no progress. Anyone else in this situation We cant be the only ones.
LHRGRU B744 First time with BA my experience was great. Seat was very good and comfortable with many adjustments. Great dining options good quality of snacks available throughout the flight. Crew very nice. One thing I did not like was the layout making it difficult for people in the middle to have aisle access when seat were turned into beds. And staring directly into peoples faces when the curtain between seats is down can be awkward. Crew didnt care too much about safety issues like seat reclining and window blinds for takeoff and landing. Entertainment was a bit disappointing screens were old and blurry not a big selection.
KBPOTP. Sandwiches and drinks served even a local wine although the flight is just over 1 hour departurelanding on time check in chaotic in Kiev Embraer 145 looked in good condition but seats are pretty cramped. If you have mediumlarge size handbag they will ask to load it in the plane as the overhead compartments are small they will give you back to you in the tarmac so no need to wait at the luggage belt crew was young but not that smiley. Good experience overall.
I travelled Premium Economy from Hong Kong to Sydney and was interested in comparing to Air New Zealands Permium Economy offering. Cathay Pacific is good but I favour Air New Zealand. Cathays PE is like a step up from Economy while Air New Zealand is a step down from Business Class. Staff were welcoming and attentive. Seats were reasonably comfortable. Pre take off drink of Champagne or Orange Juice was offered as well as hot hand towels. Food was of a good standard with proper cutlery and wine glasses. After takeoff the PE section toilets are made available to the Economy section so at times there was a queue for the toilets which is not so good. Headphones were not noise cancelling and I did experience interference. Overall felt Premium Economy was worth the extra price paid compared to Economy the superior seats and extra pampering meant I managed to get in a few hours sleep that can make a difference on long haul flights.
Flew Sun Country both ways and was so cold in the plane everyone was complaining but nothing was done. My baggage was lost on my return flight. No one on entire trip was very friendly. Worst flights ever stay clear of Sun Country.
Akasa Air cancelled a flight Visakhapatnam to Bengaluru without notifying customers resulting in a loss of INR 21000 when booking lastminute tickets. Avoid Akasa Air they dont have required infrastructure to operate they dont have messaging system to notify passengers neither they email. They appear to be customercentric on social media but when you email them they never respond.
Im not normally one to whine but here goes. LHRCDG at 0725 on a Tuesday morning via the dreaded gate A10. Plenty of Fast Track signage and we fast trackers were herded through the checkpoint onto a bus where we waited until we were joined by all the other passengers Outstanding Flight OK fairly grubby ex BD A320 but the pointlessness of a non fast Fast Track amused me no end.
Me and my fiancee were not able to get the flight because they did not accept people from different passport other than Tunisian even though I am flying from a different country and have not been in my passport country for over 2 years. I showed as a proof my Canadian PR card my ticket from Canada to Istanbul and I was still refused to get the flight. I was also not told how to proceed next how to get reimbursed or being scheduled for a next flight. Tried to call many times and still not able to speak to anyone.
Porter has fallen from the level of service and quality it once had. YOW lounge permanently closed. Cheapest fares basic now do not include a carryon and their definition of personal item is very narrow. I paid for the carryon allowed fare and was told that my bag was over the 9kg limit for carry on. These are not practices of a premium or comfort airline. These are practices I havent encountered since I flew super discount airlines in Southeast Asia. Flight was delayed almost two hours because crew was late. Upon landing at YTZ we had to wait 15 minutes because another plane was at our gate. Then it was another 15 minutes to wait for carry on luggage to be released because they were short staffed that night. So much for flying refined...
Flew London Heathrow to Bangkok with British Airways. Cabin looked worn and dated. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Disappointed with lack of snack with bar service in fact I previously flew in June and the airline always provided a fully stocked help yourself tuck box. Inflight meals a disappointment compared with other airlines. Inflight entertainment satisfactory. I have had better inflight experiences with other non direct airlines on this route.
Flight attendant was saving good seats for people that she decided she wants. Many people not just my group tried to sit in the seats but she blocked the seats with her body and gave all kinds of excuses as to why each person shouldnt sit there. When she saw people that she liked she unblocked the seats and told them to sit there. I dont know how she decides who deserves the good seats but i paid 100 for Earlybird check in me and my wife so that we would have choice of the better seats. Two other people in my group upgraded for the same reason but they couldnt get the seats either. And one of those people have hip knee and back issues and upgraded so that he would have a chance at the good seats two knee replacements one hip. replacement and multiple back surgeries The whole point of paying extraupgrading is to get those seats. I feel jipped. And I really hate to say this but there was some kind of favoritism going on. Furthermore there was another flight attendant that many people said was rude and condescending. People throughout the flight were trying to get to the front lavatories. The 2 rude flight attendants told several people that the restroom was closed. I understand that they were working in that area preparing our drinks and snacks but they were very rude to my wife and several others when telling them to go use the other lavatories. I was sitting near the front with my wife and we watched these 2 flight attendants throughout the flight. Everyone sitting near us was watching and talking about the situation too. There was one flight attendant that was very kind and polite though.
Worst experience Ive ever had flying. Lost bags on the flight from Athens to Rome. Its been about a week now and we still have no luggage. Its cost us money time and stress and Aegean dont reply to emails or answer phones to update us.
Paris to Amsterdam with Air France KLM from Amsterdam to Tokyo and AirCalin from Tokyo to Noumea. I had so many issues I am not sure where to start First my return flight from Paris to Noumea was changed so many times I lost track but it was at least 5 times. At least two times they cancelled one leg only but did not provide further information as to alternative flights. Other times they provided an inconvenient alternative and then it was almost impossible to reach a real person to select a viable alternative 34 days chatting through facebook like a bad combination of email and chatting. After our last change we got a new eticket and itinerary only they never updated the real times. And we never got a message telling us that the flight had changed. As you usually do we trusted the itinerary that they had sent but we got to the airport just in time to get in. Lucky we had decided to get to the airport 4 hours before the flight rather than 3. After running all over the airport and no support whatsoever to get through the security checks we made it just in time to board the plane only to be seated and wait for an extra hour before the plane actually took off because they decided to check the covid requirements during boarding They found one person without the requirements and then we all had to wait for the poor luggage staff to find this persons baggage inside the plane and remove it
Coxs Bazar to Dhaka with USBangla Airlines. The checkin process was smooth. The plane arrived exactly on time. But had to refuel for 15mins. We were on a full family trip. The staff was friendly and helpful. The seats were a bit tight and narrow. Food was average. Landing was smooth. We got our baggage in time. I dont know about others but my experience was satisfactory.
Toronto to Delhi via Reykjavik. I fly regularly every 6 months and tried many airlines but WOW air is the worst of all. When you look online the price would be very low and when you go to booking they keep adding price for seats and baggage I had to pay 113 for 12kg check in luggage and 65 for carry on luggage. In the end it cost me as much as any other airlines. And you have to buy food and even water and no entertainment on 10 hour long flight. It was raining in Keflavik airport and they took us to the plane in a bus and we have to walk and climb the stairs in rain and cold. I would never recommend this airline to anyone. You think it is cheap and yes it is very cheap airlines but at the price of any good airlines.
The flight left on time which was impressive given how busy the airport was. I was impressed how efficiently the staff handled the situation. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food offered for purchase was small and only water tea and coffee were provided free a charge. This was no big deal for such a short flight. Overall a pleasant flight.
FlyDubai is one of the worst airlines I have ever traveled with. Their prices are extremely high the seats are so uncomfortable. In addition the flight took an hour more than the usual. The hostess was so unfriendly and mean. The exit seats were all empty and we were not allowed to sit there as we had to pay extra money.
This was the worst airline I have ever flown with. Not even worth the cheap flights. Wanted to do something nice for our honeymoon and we ended up stuck in Bali with none of our luggage and no one knew where it was. Two days later it showed up at our hotel with no notice of its details. We tried to get in contact for compensation and they refuse to email us back and assist us for our troubles. On our flight back to the United States there was no communication telling us we needed Australian visas for our layover. We spent another hour and a half at the customer service desk. Because of our layover in Sydney they are making us claim our bags in the Sydney Airport and then pay another big amount to recheck our bags in to fly to Honolulu. This airline is a scam. Dont fly with them. They lack integrity and honesty and will do everything they can to screw you out of a dollar.
Flying two adults and a toddler. Summary of my experience 12 hours waiting at the airport getting messages every hour that my flight was delayed. Cancelled flight at 10 pm and Air Canada did not offer a hotel. No meals offered. Customer service did not answer the phone. No one available to discuss my issue.
I was traveling to Orlando from Uganda to fulfil my duties as my sisters Maid of Honor. All items for wedding I was responsible for as well as my daytoday items were in my bag. I asked the check in attendant if my bag will make it to Orlando as I had a few stops Amsterdam Manchester she said absolutely. The flight attendants for KLM were not friendly. I felt uncomfortable to ask for anything such as an extra pillowblanket for such a long flight. I finally reached Orlando and my heart sank when my bag did not come out. Completely frustrated took me over an hour to find out there is no KLM or Virgin Atlantic Offices at Orlando. I finally just saw virgin Atlantic flight rushing to their flight and they literally screamed follow us and led me to the checkin who then got me to a rep to make a claim but over an hour looking for it and no bag I wasnt happy at all. Never want to experience that again. Got my bag a week later. Not ideal for someone traveling from a far. Sending in the receipts to be reimburse was not user friendly either. Still waiting.
Phnom Penh Saigon on 13 Dec 2016 with Qatar Airways. Economy class and cheap ticket. The access given for frequent flyers silver level and up to their 3rd party lounge access in PNH is plaza Premium see other reviews very valuable and giving. Short flight 40 minutes effectively but I got it all. First time I have seen staff serving predeparture water predeparture. Well done however the service in the air is nulled too long a time before landing.
Just flew XL. Five hour delay leaving NY. An hour late boarding then circling the tarmac. Returning from Paris was just as bad. Another delay. Then people boarded then were told to disembark. We were told a 40 min delay then were called to board 5 min later. The service was horrible. We sat in the front of plane rows 112. The one attendant on the starboard side of the plane were rude. Attendants were adept at passing their eyes over anyone who needed anything. Dont be fooled by low prices it is only a relflection of terrible service and extremely uncomfortable seat with very thin cushions.
New York to Tehran via Baku. I arrived to check in desk at 730 am and explained what seat I desired but unfortunately the guy on front desk was in training and issued a boarding pass with uncomfortable seat which I didnt expect at all. When I entered the plane and found out about my seat I asked the crew to change They said the flight is full and couldnt change the seat however a crew changed my seat and made everything comfortable and pleasant to destination. During the flight the crew worked hard and made a wonderful flight for all passengers.
If you do not check in and pay for your bags and seat before going to the airport they will charge you double the cost to do so at the checkin window. On my flight from Lima to Cusco I tried multiple times to pay in advance but the website would not allow me to finalize payment. When I got to the Lima airport I explained this and showed my attempts. They understood and allowed me to pay the online rate. Conversely when the website would not allow me to complete the payment transaction and I explained the issue at the checkin window on the Cusco airport they ignored me and I ended up paying an extra 100 USD more than I would have had their website functioned properly. it was explained to me that the fees had just recently gone up a day or two prior and that in Lima they had charged me the full rate. I find this very hard to accept given that I only paid 30 USD in Lima and 200 in Cusco. I saw the agent I was dealing with giggling with the agent sitting next to her while she was dealing with my issue. Very untrustworthy. Would never fly with this airline.
I just want to thank Bangkok Airways for their time and accommodations with my flight which was booked by agent without understanding of the specific requirements for the flights in Thailand during the pandemic especially the manager on arrival who helped me a lot to change my flight unfortunately I didnt ask his name. I didnt get the same service from Aeroflot and particularly from Finnair. The manager went toward me and helped me to change my flight for the right one if all airlines will be working like that it will be easier to fly specially at present time during pandemic which already makes tourism very difficult for passengers. Besides that everything in airport was very good organized and done for the people on arrival not like in Europe.
Two regular an uneventful flights. Curiously enough though with the exact same crew The crew were very nice and the service is very attentive and polite but I just cannot take it that British Airways has chosen to provide a service just like low cost carriers where everything is charged for apart from luggage. On the second leg of the trip the aircraft felt extremely warm and for some odd reason row 6 where I was sitting did not have AC.
After an extreme delay in Milan on Aegean and missing my flight to Mykonos I was rebooked on Olympic Air. I took my new ticket and other Aegean info the Olympic counter to check in as I was told. I had been up all night with no sleep and after handing the agent the new tickets and my passport and my old Aegean ticket he literally threw it back at me and said you are flying Aegean not Olympic and rolled his eyes. After a deep breath I informed him I had been rebooked and he then asked why I didnt show him the new ticket in a nasty tone. I informed him I handed him the new ticket with my passport and if he took time he would have noticed. I asked him politely why he literally threw the papers at me even if I was flying with Aegean and if that was how he was trained to deal with the public. I also asked him if I needed a manager to check me in. Then after no apology he then checked me in and I was on my way. I go to Greece often and this experience is why I usually try to fly Aegean. The flight itself was a joke. They set up the beverage cart to serve two people me and one other in front and then took cart to back to breakdown. But everyone was nice except the ticket agent.
Hurghada to Paris via Istanbul. Overall the experience with was okay. Flights on time they offered you a free visit of the city when transiting over Istanbul. Staff are friendly aircraft is comfortable. However when we got our luggage in Paris it was soaked in water. Not really very pleasant. There are no USB sockets in the plane really annoying if you want to recharge your phone on a 3hrs flight and for the food which was good compared to some airlines they tend to run out of some choices and you have to go with whats available left which is also a bit annoying.
Return journey Gatwick to Dubrovnik. Outward journey seating was basic but were at least served a basic cardboard tasting breakfast and one drink. Return journey departing at 12 noon only served either hot drink and 1 biscuit or cold drink and small of packet of crisps. I think this is slowly acclimatising people to refreshments being withdrawn completely early next year on short haul flights. Staff were very friendly but they must be embarrassed by the lowering of standards on British Airways.
Agents at the ticket counter are rude. From FFLKIN they were delayed for 1 hr and didnt bother to announce it. Upon return they were overbooked and were asking everyone if they wanted to reschedule. The return flight was no better another delay without announcement.
Boston return. Very quick checkin at Heathrow let down by slow fast track but thats the airports fault. B gate lounge quiet nice refreshmentsI dont think the childrens games consoles have worked in the entire time T5 has been open. Short walk to boarding full plane left slightly early landed well ahead of schedule. Crew excellent worked hard throughout. Decent food as well again. Entertainment out on new system good older system back not as good and screen not in best order. Return flight same comments pretty much except my wifes video system didnt work on way back so they just let her sit in first. Keep it up BA.
I was really surprised with this flight between Cayenne French Guiana and Paris in business class. There is a new business class on the A330300 angle lie seat with a recline of 160 18 seats with a configuration 2x2x2 outbound 8.5 hrs flight to Paris. Very good staff during this night flight I called to get some water and the attendant was there within 2 minutes. You can really sleep well in this new seat inbound 9 hours flight very good food wine champagne with attentive service really worth the money. Only 1300 euros for a return ticket.
Such a bad flight. I was traveling from Srinagar to Bangalore on 27th of January. The flight got delayed cabin crew shown no respect at all.
POSMIA. Everything was smooth from checkin to boarding but the flight left 1hr late due to connecting pax. Flight Attendants were friendly and the coconut bake and fish was lovely. Luggage allowance was good and crew informative.
Such a disgusting service. Never again. Was denied boarding for a flight from Casablanca to Basel on Dec 31 for no reason. The guy at check in counter just said to me you cant get this flight without a transit visa. A connecting flight to my home country was departing from Basel in just 6 hours 24 hours visafree transit is allowed in Switzerland for Russian nationals. I tried to claim compensation from the airline. They replied but with We dont have any refundcancellation policy didnt even apologise.
Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London. The whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found they should be sent to our air bb house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves On 3rd August Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August they told us that they had already sent the found luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However when we came to the airport again we couldnt find our luggage and the staff didnt explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th how come it would disappear on the 5th The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing You cant imagine how furious and frustrated we were We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. Thats how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it. My wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip.
Very bad experience. Flight schedule keep changing when your flight is nearby and the they dont want to listen you. Never get any emails reply and they dont provide any refund. So be careful before choosing this airlines.
I am a frequent flyer with BA and have been for the last 15 years. Having noted the ratings given frankly I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service. In a nutshell BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation. This fact was hammered home on my return leg which was not in Club Europe. Quite alarmingly BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its Business Class seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency. I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen. Shorthaul business Club Europe is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for loungepreboarding benefits. While cabin crew service is excellent the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices etc. places them a million airmiles behind competing airlines such as Qatar Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality. BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers really I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name Budget Airways The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer careappreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip. Both flights were around 4 hours in duration on the same day. Guess which one is shows BAs inflight offering
We booked to fly with Thomas Cook from Stansted to Skiathos in August and our flights were changed to an airline called Smartlynx a couple of months before not a problem at all. On the day we boarded promptly and the crew were very friendly. The aircraft itself was nice seats were comfy and the cabin was clean. Same good experience on the return flight although we had a slight delay and landed into Stansted about 40 minutes behind schedule but its nothing significant so no problems there. Crew again were very good and the aircraft was clean with the same comfortable seats. Thomas Cook were cheaper than most airlines on this route and would happily fly with them again.
Brand new Airbus planes that are as clean as can be. Friendly cabin crew and ground staff. The departure time out of Iceland is not the best but its understandable that they are given the worst timing slots as being the newcomer on the market.
Flight started with severely disorganized and chaotic boarding process. We had paid extra for priority boarding only to hear at the gate that no priority boarding is supposed to happen on this flight at least we were pushed to the head of the queue afterwards but WTH The boarding itself apparently was started before the plane has even landed after its previous flight. As a result the entire passenger queue already after passing the passes control has been waiting for another 20 minutes standing and waiting while the plane was being unloaded. Obviously no cleaning of the plane has been done we have found some used napkins on our seats. Speaking of the seats those were extremely uncomfortable. They did have an average leg space for a lowcost Ill give them that but they had no proper head support and did not provide proper back support either. The armrests could only have been raised halfway so you had a choice to either feel them at your sides or at your shoulders normally we would just push the armrest between our seats up and fly without. Ive even witnessed one of our fellow passengers standing up at the aisle for a while to read and rest from these seats. Now Im writing this from home with severe back pain that Ive experienced for the first time in my life after this flight and I blame the seats. For the reference the specific plane was PHHZX. Curiously enough the first flight AMSSVQ didnt have these issues the only thing I can whine about was the long queuing time at the airport but I expected nothing better during the holiday season anyway. In any case now my stance towards the airline is never again unless Im really forced to.
Dubai to Bahrain. So we all know that economy gets you from A to B safely and we are not expecting much especially with a short hop like this only a one hour flight. Paid for a extra room seat at Door 3 24 D being an aisle on the B777. Flight was very full with many children and to their credit two of the crew were very engaging with them and their parents. What I do not get is why Emirates insist on placing ten across high density on all their B777 aircraft an industry norm these days but it begs belief. As the crew went up and down the aisle I was knocked into over 12 times in less than an hour and I am 78 Kg some at least had the courtesy to apologize most did not bother. I get its cattle class but I for one would never set foot on these aircraft in this high density. I find EK crew to be stoic tired looking the crew member at my door crew seat looked as if he dying for his bed head in his hands yawned non stop and a lot of the crew looked plain disinterested. This is obviously down to crew planning being over stretched. Overall ok flight deck did a great job with announcements and the flight itself and landing was excellent true skill. Would not fly long haul based on this you see a totally different service and staff attitude between J and Y class. Engaged to must I do the basics.
These guys really dont deserve to get your business. I tend to use many different airlines and also use lowcost airlines accepting that I will receive less service for the money I paid. I had my struggles with some airlines but I dont recall being as disappointed as I have been with Air Malta. First they cancelled my flight two weeks after I booked it of course without letting me know any reason. I was lucky enough to get an alternative for the same day stopping over in Munich. Besides the additional stop that was not even a detour but was so early in the day that it got troublesome already since we were staying at the neighbour island Gozo and having to catch a ferry before the flight. Four weeks later they inform me that even this new flight got rescheduled and starts even one hour earlier. When asking for an alternative flight the customer service lady told me that they wont offer me any alternatives as the rescheduling was less than two hours. When pointing out that my original flight was planned seven hours later she said as I had confirmed the first change I am no longer eligible for objecting against the change. So I have to accept every rescheduling from my changed flight plan if it is a change of less than 2 hrs. I had to let go off our last day on Gozo had to find a new hotel near the airport for a family of 5 had a ruined day with sleepdeprived kids and an endless wait at the connecting airport.
Flights from London to Istanbul then to Cairo and then return. Flight to Istanbul was ok food served and service was reasonably quick. On arrival at Istanbul airports there was no gate listed for onward connection and the connection was tightIstanbul airport was terrible. Finally found the connecting gate this flight was a Boeing 737 old hard seats and a full flight. Again a meal servedtepid but edible. Landed on time. Return flight was from Alexandria airport 5 security checks before we could enter the plane. Aircraft was on time but half way through the flight there was a medical emergency which was dealt with admirably by the crew luckily there was also a doctor on board. We were served breakfast. Final flight was Boeing 777 from Istanbul to London served the same breakfast but no complaints as some well known airlines handout a packet of crisps. The only real complaints are the airports both Istanbul and Alexandriathey both need better communication.
Such a 5 star experience with Asiana Airlines OZ from SGNICN. Everything is good professional and spotless. The ticket is quite expensive but worth it. Will fly this again for sure. Good meal and Inflight entertainment.
Travelled on August 8th when there was a power outage at London Heathrow which resulted in missing baggage. The way BA handled is pathetic with no proper communication regarding status of bags. I called several times and had to go to the airport twice. There was much confusion with the BA people claiming 2 of the tags issued were not found in their system so no claim was made for these missing bags. No follow up though I was promised they will call me later that day on the 10th. Finally the bags arrived on the 11th but the whole experience left me not wanting to travel with BA again.
Departed Jorge Newbury Airport AEP Buenos Aires to GaleaoGIG Rio de Janeiro. Flight number AR 2252 22 August 2012. Embraer 190 aircraft. Arrived at the airport in time for a 9.50am departure. There were many announcements in Spanish but very few in English until English speaking passengers enquired at departure gates. Flight was 1 hour late with no explanation given. Flight itself was fantastic however cabin crew were less than friendly and did not even check our boarding pass to direct us to our assigned seat as we boarded. Inflight snack was some sort of carrot cake caramel filled biscuit covered in a white chocolate substance with a caramel sweet.
We were booked on a flight with Phuket Airways to fly out on the 26th March with family about a month before we were due to fly we found this web site regarding the disasters that had already happened we have visited Thailand several times and are not nervous passengers but upon reading the reports we tried to change airlines through our booking agent but were unable to because our original tickets were not transferable so we flew to Bangkok as planned once we were on the plane we noticed that the overhead panneling was hanging down once we had taken off the passenger sitting underneath this was getting wet due to condensation they advised the cabin crew of the problem who got another member of staff who then proceeded to stuff the gap with paper and tried to seal the panel with some form of masking tape which did not work my overhead light did not work there was a blocked toilet where someone had put a disposable nappy down so eventually this toilet was taped off and out of use the passenger behind seat would not go into the upright position but because the plane was only half full he could sit in the seat next to him we eventually arrived in Bangkok without any further incidences but not looking forward to our return flight we were on holiday for three weeks but some of the family were to return on the 8th April. We proceeded our holiday and spent the last week in Hong Kong and were to return to Bangkok on the 13th April for 3 days before flying back to the U.K. with Phuket Airways once we had boarded the plane at Hong Kong Thai Airways we picked up a complimentary newspaper Bangkok Post only to see the headlines PHUKET AIR WOES LEAVE 800 FUMING after reading that the aircraft had not passed the safety inspections and the problems with the fuel and hydraulic systems and all but 2 planes were grounded made us very wary about flying home to the UK with them we made the decision that once we had landed at Bangkok we would try to find an alternative airline to fly home with at our own exspense we eventually succeeded to find 2 seats with Eva Air 2 days earlier than planned but for peace of mind we were prepared to pay for the airline tickets. Although we had arranged our flights with another airline we were interested to see if Phuket Airlines were still going to fly to Gatwick on the date we were due to fly with them once we were at Bangkok Airport we located Phuket Offices but they were closed our flight was the following day so when we arrived at the airport the next day we approached Phuket Offices and after waiting several minutes a member of staff appeared and we asked when was the next flight to Gatwick only to be told they didnt know switched off the lights and locked the office. We proceeded with our flight home safely with Eva Air only to speak to our family that had flown home with Phuket Air on the 8th April to hear that there had been uproar with a fellow passenger who insisted that they were assured that the aeroplane that were travelling back on was not the one that had had hydraulic problems previously he was assured by the captain that this was not the same plane but once on board the story changed and it was the same plane so all in all what a sham airline and the moral of the story is never to fly or recommend Phuket Airlines although we would not be surprised to hear that they had gone bankrupt.
Frankfurt to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha. This was a pleasant trip with Qatar Airways. All the cabin crew members were friendly and attentive. Plenty of drinks were offered and when we asked for anything the crew went the extra mile to fulfil our wishes. One of our B773ER planes and the A330 still had the old Oryx One entertainment system with a lowresolution screen the newer entertainment systems on the other planes were excellent Especially the flight in their B787 was very comfortable even in economy class. The A330 cabin was rather dated they should retrofit these planes with newer seats. The food was excellent compared to other economy products. Transfer in Doha was smooth. The only issue on this trip were the rude and incompetent local airport ground staff at SGN who conducted checkin for Qatar Airways they enforced the weight limits for baggage down to the last gram as strictly as for any lowcost carrier. I cant imagine Qatars own staff to be that stringent on weight limits.
LHRWashington on a 777200. Trip got off to a good start in the BA Concorde 1st Class lounge. Nice champagne and a nice quiet ambiance which I like. The place is starting to show signs of wear and tear with sagging seat cushions. Plane was latest 1st Class and there was only 7 passengers including my wife and I. It seemed a little larger than the 1st I travelled on a month ago on an A380. Maybe it was because of the hideous centre console that houses he folding table was smaller rather than take up half the space. To start we had a small appetizer an Amuse Bouche which was absolutely hideous. A sort of grilled cheese with burnt bits on it and some sort of couscous. It was foul and we left the lot. Both had a langoustine starter which was ok. The mushrooms with it was wet and horrible texture to the mouth. The soup we both had was nice. My cod dish was very good. My wife said the steak two ways was ok. The braised part she did not eat. Wines all ok. Service from the FAs was fine. In terms of overall quality BA really fail consistently to deliver. As a matter of curiosity I sourced the on way price the day before we left 5543 one way. Its an insane price and if I paid that I would be furious as to the product I experienced. Travelling in 1st is only worth it on sale offers or Avios. We are travelling back in Club as in my experienced the slightly shorter flight home in First is not worth the money or the Avios. So disappointing. BA really are clueless when it comes to understanding quality.
London Gatwick to Antigua. Having flown premium economy with other airlines we decided to upgrade our cabin for our holiday in Antigua at a cost of 350 to British Airways World Traveller Plus and we were told by the sales adviser that we would receive a bigger seat pitch more personal service with dedicated staff for this cabin grade better choice of meals and beverages. What we received was a polarisation of this we had very poor service and the only difference between economy and our cabin grade was a slightly bigger seat pitch. Having flown long haul with BA on numerous occasions in the past I am completely shocked at the service we received it was more like a budget airline we received a half class of bubbly prior to take off this was quickly followed with a drink service one drink per passenger we then received our meal service. I asked for white wine which was warm not chilled and there was no ice about 50 minutes later they served lukewarm coffee. This is not the type of service I expect on any flight let alone in the upgraded World Traveller Plus cabin. After several hours when no other drinks service was offered I went to the galley to ask for a drink for myself and my fiance to be told there were no drinks left apart from whisky or red wine which neither one of us drink. As the flight wasnt full I cant believe there would be a problem you just dont expect to hear this given the cost of the holiday and the upgrade that you have can only have 2 drinks on an 8 hour plus flight 5 hours after the dinner service we were given a sandwich and that was the conclusion of the service aboard a flight of more than eight hours certainly not what I would expect from an airline such as BA. Our return flight was in economy and the only difference was a slightly smaller seat pitch but as this flight again wasnt full we ended up with 3 seats between 2 of us. The service was exactly the same as on the outboard flight ie. same poor standard and for the first time ever there was no hot breakfast before landing we were served a brick hard croissant. I was looking to book a long haul holiday to the Maldives next year with BA but after this flight and the appalling customer service I received when I complained about the service on the flight when I was told that when you pay for an upgrade your paying for a bigger TV screen and bigger seat which I certainly dont think that justifies 350 upgrade fee. If you are thinking of upgrading I would think twice about what you are paying for. BA have now lost my custom and having spoken to other people on holiday I am not alone in making this decision and therefore I have booked my holiday next year with Virgin Atlantic. BA can no longer rely on there previous good name they are cutting too many corners giving poor service and not interested in listening to their customer they need to decide if they are going down the budget airline route. If that is the case they need to drastically cut the prices or start to give a more professional service and raise the standards where customers feel they are getting a good service for the price they have paid.
This was the first time we had flown with Gulf Air what a pleasant surprise. At the airport great staff really helpful. The plane clean and seat comfy for economy. Food good for economy staff helpful entertainment system good but choice of newer films very limited. We will fly with them again.
The worst airline experience. After destroying my bag the claims office at the Boston airport made all these promises and for a brief moment I felt assured Id be taken care of. Not only are they negligent but theyre trying to get away with not paying me. Airport staff took photos of every item damaged and I provided receipts for 10 out of 13 items who even keeps receipts from years ago still no payment is being made as theyre trying to get away with not paying me.
The Airnorth flight did not get off to a good start having been delayed by an hour. Once in the air service was efficient and effective. The in flight food was satisfactory. The seats are adequate with sufficient pitch and recline to not cause any issues. The tickets were bought on special giving good value for money.
After my flight from SD to SLC was delayed I missed my flight to Dallas. I walked towards Delta customer service near A15 when in order to find the quickest flight to Dallas. One of the customer service agents found a direct flight with the earliest arrival at 919PM. I asked the agent whether they can upgrade my seat for the inconvenience since I payed to insure my ticket. The gentleman sent to a lady and she said she I upgraded you to Comfort. That made me feel good until I scanned my ticket to board and they did not upgrade my seat.
I had a Nepal Airlines flight from Kathmandu to Delhi. The flight was 8 am but suddenly changed its time to 11 am and no one informed about that. Was surprised that on that day they were using A330. It was a new bird. So after sitting in the flight we waited there 1 hr due to traffic so more delay. But the cabin was really good. They had entertainment System that was really good. Good selection of movies. They had veg and non veg food option I choose the veg option and the food needs to get improvement.They also served soft drink. Overall the flight was good except the food needs improvement.
Singapore to Hong Kong. New cabin I can t believe SQ spent so much in upgrading the business class seat which on 777300 is way more elegant and comfortable. Still same awkward angle and I have never experienced such hard seats. Claustrophobic narrow hard and squeezing more seats. Will avoid as much as possible flying on the A380.
Honolulu to SeoulIncheon proceeding to Hong Kong in June 2019 but Im going to focus on the Honolulu Seoul leg only for this review. This was my 7th flight on Korean Air and all of this started on a very speedy nononsense checkin process at Honolulu International Airport. The immigration checks were quick and after a short bite I went to the gate 2.5 hours before departure time. The boarding gate staffs were overall great so does the cabin crews. I was welcomed in a friendly way. Upon reaching my seat I figured out that my seat was comfortable in terms of legroom with tons of features but the seats were quite firm and hard and there were several kid stickers that the cleaning crew had missed. Not a big deal for me. Throughout the entire flight the crew kept on being friendly to me they asked everything even asking me if I have ever tried Bibimbap before my 1st meal for the flight which tasted very good. The 2nd meal of mine served before landing was beef with rice which tasted good but the meal presentation made me deny the 5star rating. By this point the crews were still very friendly but they couldnt hide the tiredness they had after the 9hour journey which is normal. The biggest blow of the flight was the IFE hence why I didnt give this flight a 1010. The IFE for me won in terms of responsiveness and layout but the contents were very lacking especially the movie section and music with most of them being 13 or 16 contents with only a few contents that were appropriate to be accessed by everyone. The saving grace of the IFE was the game sections and the onboard camera facility. Actual departure and landing time were pretty on time. In conclusion apart from the IFE which according to their social media sites has been renovated this flight was one of the best well in fact the best flights Ive ever taken in 2019 with the crew becoming the shining stars of this flight.
Booked to fly Turkish Airlines from Madrid to Alexandria via Istanbul. Worst flight service of my past 5 years. I chose this flight specifically due to its catchy price and most importantly short transit time as I have a family with 1 year old son. Flight from Madrid was delayed by 5 hours flew 11.30 pm instead of 6.15 pm since it was not possible to catch my connection flight they booked me the next trip 12.55 pm an extra night and almost 9 hours transit time. Arrived into Istanbul and my baby was extremely tired asked Turkish information desk for a place to spend the night but a rude employee told me go to the public restrooms. They were extremely uncomfortable so I went back and asked again this time they gave me 5 hours lounge stay where again it was impossible to sleep. Overall a horrible nightmare experience. Rude employees who dont have any ideas on how to satisfy a customer.
London Heathrow to Paris CDG. Really enjoyed flying with Air France. Boarding was fast and organised new aircraft friendly staff and croissants and hot beverages was offered during this 40mins flight. Totally recommend Air France.
Boston to Keflavik. Horrible airline Really WOW wow the worst ever Their personal act like theyve got license to be rude. First and last time Im flying Wow Air. For the international flight they charged me 70 for a small carryon
Milan to Mombasa via Istanbul. They changed the flights 5 times between the date I bought the tickets and the departure due to the opening of the new airport. Then they lost the bags of the full flight in their new airport in Istanbul After 5 days we are still waiting for any information about our bags. They ask you to fill in the online questionnaire because the one done at the airport with their staff had no reference number. To open the report of the claim they tell you to list one by one the items included in your bags indicating the price of each one otherwise the claim report remains open because they flag it as missing documents. They dont know where the bags are and since they have the worst client service ever seen in my life you only receive standard answers. Never again with TK.
Flew Zagreb Frankfurt return. Check in was fast and smooth. Outbound flight on A320 very clean aircraft. Staff were great very friendly and attentive to all passengers. There was no inflight entertainment at all just a few screens with commercials. Generally good service for 1.5 hour flight.
Singapore to Xiamen. I am extremely disappointed with Singapore Airlines I am an United Gold customer. Before I booked my flight I called Singapore Airlines to verify whether I can use the airport lounge due to my United Gold status. The staff gave me wrong info and as a result I paid 100 more to book Singapore Airlines. However at the airport I was refused and was told that the staff gave me wrong info. They refused to correct their mistakes and give me refund. This is ridiculous The service was not any better than United and I dont even get the choice of meal that I want because they didnt prepare enough only 25 of the meal is fish.
Qatar cancelled my flight on 29th Jan so I had to rebook it. Due to the failure of their online system I wasnt able to do it so I wrote them a message. My message was ignored for 4 days so I had no other option that to call them after waiting 30min for someone to pick up the phone finally my call got answered and flights rebooked for 5th Feb. In the meantime I asked 3 times if the seats that I paid for will be assigned on this new flight and it was confirmed 3 times that they will. I checked my booking online and no seats were assigned. Had to call again and spend another hour to try to sort out situation. She said she is unable to do anything other than give us other seats I asked for if she can check other flight etc. She wasnt willing to do anything. I had to cancel flights find another airline and spend extra to solve the problem.
Outstanding inflight service from the crew. Friendly professional and helpful. The very best of British. Even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at Vancouver it didnt matter. The crew made the flight outstanding.
Bahrain to Paris via Dubai. Due to current situation I kept chacking on Emirates airline website to see if the flight has been cancelled but there is no updates and also the phone doesnt answer at all. France has imposed Lockdown from Tuesday 17th March 2020 mid day but Emirates has not yet updated its page. If our trip is cancelled due to Coronavirus then why Emirates wants to charge us with penalty for refund. This is my second trip with Emirates and both times I have been forced to cancel the trips.
I was impressed by Druk Air though admittedly we were business class. Good food very comfortable seats 2x2 and professional friendly informative staff. We flew Delhi Khtamandu Paro and the meal was excellent on board. Sit on the left for the omost amazing view of 8 of the 10 highest mountains in the world helpfully pointed out by the pilots commentry. A319s modern comfortable well maintained and toilets clean. Business class is definately worth the small supplement. Exceptional helpfulness of the airline when we were stranded by bad weather in Paro.
I had 4 flights in July 2008 with Iran Air. There were the worst flights Ive had in my life. The first flight was London to Tehran. The airplane was so old and the washroom was a big mess. The flight attendants were so rude and Ive seen at least 2 load arguments between passengers and the attendants. The second flight Tehran to Tabriz. The airplane stopped in the middle of runway for the last minute maintenance. They didnt let us go back to the airport and we had to stay in the airplane for half an hour without air condition in mid summer. Well these are nothing comparing the nightmare I had when I was coming back from Tehran to London. The flight had 5 hours delay which seems normal. There were at least 50 passengers among those people including me had a connection flight to other destination. When we asked the status about our next flight which we lost it weve been told every thing has been organized and they already reserved a seat for our destination. Even though the Pilot in the airplane made a commitment few times that every thing is ok and we dont have to worry about our next flight. It was a joke. When we arrived to London nothing was organized and Iran air office even didnt know we are coming. When we asked about our connection flight he said Why did you come here I already called Iran and asked them not to send them here After fighting about 3 hours we got the hotel to stay over night in London. I lost one day work and flew to Toronto with British Airways next day. My advice is never taking Iran Air.
I have traveled so much on different airlines and they have never treated me like they did on this airline. I mean that this airline VivaAerobus is the most terrible to treat its passengers. They sell all the services online and oversell the tickets. I bought a ticket from Houston to Mexico 1st class as it was VIP for October 14 2022. The day before I did my checking and paid for my luggage and seat. Grab my boarding pass I show up at the airport 3 hours before. First the flight was delayed and when boarding they said that my boarding pass had a problem and with me other people. The manager had assigned my room because I missed the flight When I was in the front row to board as a VIP They are thieves and their staff is pathetic I give it 1 star and they dont deserve it Be careful when you choose an airline like this to travel
Pegasus Airlines lost my bag. I filed a report at my destination airport but even after multiple mails and calls they didnt seem to care at all. I applied for a refund but was offered a ridiculous amount of money. After three months I finally received one half of the refund but the other half is still missing. Pegasus does not answer my mails. I will never fly with this airline again even if they offer the cheapest prices.
I have been waiting 6 months for a refund and they never reply to any emails or enquires. Terrible airlines and terrible service. They have basically taken free money for a service that was never provided. This airline is nothing short of a giant scam. Never will I ever book with Thai Lion Air again and I will warn every single traveller to avoid this airline at all costs.
Taipei Songshan to Tokyo Haneda on board A330 Hello Kitty livery. Cute interior and music. Even toilet papers are Hello Kittyrelated. Delicious inflight fruit meal requested beforehand. Cabin super clean with wellbehaved passengers. All in all a very pleasant economy class experience.
New York JFK to Dubai via Kuwait. Very spacious legroom for economy but frequent Late flights. IFE had a small selection of movies cabin Crew extremely rude and unprofessional. Ground Staff rude and unhelpful. Transfer experience at Kuwait is confusing and difficult. Kuwait Airport lacks many facilities common in most international airports Review I initially booked this flight because it was the cheapest option to Dubai around 60 cheaper than the competition big mistake. I did not have a single flight with Kuwait either on my way to Dubai or back that was on time. From JFK my flight was delayed for 3 hours causing me to miss my connection to Dubai. They put us in a Hotel on Airport property which although had a good view of the apron was a subpar hotel. The ground staff do not know how to do their job correctly. They are rude and the airport lacks proper signage. You are bussed around from terminal to terminal with no real staff presence to guide you. We almost missed our flight to JFK because the gate was labeled Mumbai so we didnt know that it was intended for New York. Kuwait Airport doesnt even seem qualified to be a domestic airport lacking proper signage and two distant terminals which youre bussed around in. Ground crew does not care about you and show no interest or courtesy when dealing with you. The same can be said with the cabin crew. They are rude and do not know how to treat passengers. The meal timings are horrible as they leave many passengers extremely hungry for long hours on the plane and water service is extremely selective. Youd think an airline knows when to give out water and food. They also gave us no details about our stop in Shannon on our way back to JFK and could not be seen for much of the flight. The only good part about the flight was the legroom which was spacious. However that is not a reason for booing Kuwait over any other competent airline. Do not book Kuwait they dont care about customers and lack the competency to even communicate basic necessary facts to customers.
Gatwick to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. It was a very good flight except that the entertainment system was old on the second flight. The crew were amazing. The only thing what I would want they should add is an English version of their new Lego safety video. It was the cheapest flight available including a 30kg luggage.
I have flown with Sir Lankan Airlines for the first time after the reopening of the international borders postpandemic softened in Feb 2022. The complete trip was nothing but a nightmare and the worst ever travel experience. Though Ive paid additional charges on the ticket for the flexibility of changing the travel dates I have been charged almost full charges for such changes made due to unforeseen personal events. Sri Lankan Airlines have applied penalty charges that are almost the price of the ticket on the date of change and made me pay the full ticket price. As I booked the ticket from an agent the agent was unable to reissue the ticket without waiving the penalty as I have paid the additional amount already for the date change flexibility. The agent asked me to contact Sri Lankan Airlines in the city I was living when making the changes to the ticket date. I contacted them over the phone and they said they were unable to find my booking and asked me to visit their office in person along with my ticket and travel documents. When I went there they said they are unable to change the date as a travel agent has issued it and they have to manually calculate the fare difference for the invoice and they dont have the authority to do. Then have asked me to contact the main branch of Sri Lankan Airlines in the country from where I was requesting the date change. When I contacted the main office they asked me to contact the Sri Lankan Airlines office which is located in the country from where I have booked the ticket. When I contacted them they asked me to contact the agent as they also cannot do anything. I have contacted the travel agent and he said they can certainly take over the booking and make the changes and waive off the penalty as the travel agent was unable to do so. The travel agent has asked me to contact Sri Lankan Airlines located in Sri Lanka. When I contacted them more than seven times. Each time a different representative have taken the call and have asked me to repeat the full ordeal and put me on hold and disconnected the call all seven times. Finally I was able to talk to one of the agents Shimla and she has put me through a supervisor. After listening to everything told me he cannot change the reissuing date. When I confronted them that they certainly can and they are reluctant to help only because they have to waive off the penalty they are saying so he simply told me sorry about it. I have been going through personal grief and trauma and during this time I have to deal with such commercialminded humans was not an easy process. Particularly when I have done all the right things and demanded only what I am eligible for in terms of my rights reissuing doesnt apply the penalty as I have paid the additional fee for the date change flexibility. I have high regard for the Sri Lankan people however my experience with the Airlines is an absolute nightmare
Not only my first flight in 17 years but also my first time back to England for 17 years. I flew from PMILGW on 21012023 and returned on 29012023. Both Wizz Air and EasyJet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage. British Airways were the most convenient and best value option available they offered ideal flight times and the 18 charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable Total cost for both flights was 126 Regular update information via email seamless online seat allocation and check in. Efficient staff at the check in desks at PMI and LGW ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible. Immaculate aircraft comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom Im 64 tall Cabin crew were polite friendly and professional. In flight food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced I enjoyed the Meat Ploughmans and IPA beer 10 total on both flights I have flown 80 times in the last 50 years with different airlines on various propeller and jet aircraft as well as one LGWLHR helicopter transfer. Flying was a totally different experience back in the day we are now in the age of the budget airline Nostalgia aside.. British Airways are the best airline Ive flown with.
When I enter the airport Spicejet person asked me whether I am having a printed boarding pass or not. I said that I am having the printed boarding pass and its in my mobile then he asked me to go the luggage dropping counter. The staff who was on the desk checked the weight of the luggage and asked me to screen the luggage and drop it in luggage belt. I said its only hand luggage so I asked him to allow to carry with me. I also told him that I have travelled from Mumbai with same Hand luggage before two days. But he rudely asked me put in the luggage as the weight of the luggage is 8kgs. I requested him as I am having a connecting flight to Bhubaneswar so plz allow as it is just 1kg above the limit. But his behaviour was not at all satisfactory. I am posting this at 130pm sitting at boarding gate. Boarding is scheduled at 1255pm and Boarding is not started.
On Flight SA203 to JFK New York 21 June 2018 the entertainment etc was not working. Not only our family of five but all the passengers on the flight. The staff did not know how to resolve the problem served dinner and vanished leaving one staff member in the galley who I did not see once came round to offer water. The staff emerged again for breakfast service and advised us to take the matter further with customer services from SAA. We reported the incident got a reference number and not even an apology since.
These clowns dont know what they are doing. Typically you board from the back of the plane forward after doing business andor first class. We sat in zone 1 which is more to the front of the plane. Due to sitting in an aisle seat I was hit by almost every person walking by including the flight attendants. On top of that I had my back pack removed from the overhead compartment to make room for someones elses. In all my years of flying if the over head compartments are full they normally take the carrying on luggage and put it with the checked bags. In this particular instance we had elderly people with back problems having their backpacks removed from over head compartments to have their backpacks stored under the seat in front of them. This poses as a problem for people with back and knee problems as you feel like a sardine in these already crammed planes. These people are apparently young and inexperienced and use a major lesson in customer service as it is us the paying customer that is the reason why they have jobs
Washington to Accra. South African airways was the most affordable way for me to travel. If you are flying out of Washington be mindful of your carry on luggage. All pieces of carry on luggage were weighed at least 3 times. If anything was over the limit you were obligated to pay. If you go with South African expect bad behavior and rudeness.
Freetown to Tokyo via Paris. The A340 on the FreetownParis leg is in desperate need of an upgrade the seats are old and tired the IFE screen is 6 inches and poor quality and the bathrooms dirty and worn. Paris to Tokyo return was acceptable but not great. On one leg I made the mistake of paying for an emergencyexit seat and whilst the legroom was great the seat width was severely limited due to the TV and table in the armrest. On the return leg the seats were tightly packed with little legroom. IFE was limited very few options. All the meals were average as was the service. The Japanese crew were friendly and attentive whilst the French crew tended to go through the motions and then hide away. You didnt see them outside of the meal service. My experience with Air France is that the crew just disappear and they dont seem to really enjoy their work or be motivated to provide good customer service.
Mexico City to Beijing via Tijuana. Booking the ticket was not easy with unfriendly website and selecting a seat was not possible until check in. The flight was delayed for 8hrs due weather and Mexico City ground staff did not help with the fact that it was a weather delay and this was not their fault. Inflight the service is good the flight attendants are attentive. The inflight entertainment is outdated lacks variety and does not compare to other 5 star airlines. The food was the worst food I have had. The seats are okay.
Good service the whole way. Nothing exceptional but it was only a short flight. Plane was clean and refreshments were provided. My only issue is that the flight was packed understandable as it was just before Chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic even with the masks My return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either just hoping for a little more personal space next time Also wifi did not work. I also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time brought in for the pandemic Im sure but I hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant. Value for money marked down only because the Christmas flights were so expensive To be expected though I know.
I am Turkish and used THY services more than 10 times in the last 4 years. I believe you should be looking for another airline company if you are not obliged to use their services due to the following reasons For international flights THY is as far as I concern only airline which has a direct flight from Los Angeles LAX to Istanbul IST airport. That was the main reason I have decided to use their services again and I regret my decision not surprisingly. There are two different scenarios Imagine you are arranging a flight from LAX to IST which has a domestic transfer from IST to Izmir Adnan Menderes ADB airport. They leave only 55 minutes between 2 flights where you should get into passport check and airport security. As if this wasnt enough your LAX flight gets delayed 35 mins and they only postpone your flight for only 510 minutes. The cream of the pie was they assign the domestic transfer gate to the furthest possible one. When you arrive at the gate after having a small running competition and just as you are seeing that they are shutting the gate down you are being told that it is too late now instead of not shutting down the gate. Then you are going to the ticket office and they are saying that the next flight is like 6 hours later. After you have been flown like 13 hours you are going to wait 6 more hours. Thanks that is classy. I will need to buy food internet and sit here for 6 hours. I have just come here to see my family after three years and I have only a week here. So your free ticket doesnt solve the issues does it Oh the second one is even better. The very similar scenario above but you are flying to Beograde Tesla Airport if I remember the name correctly instead of having a domestic flight. Delays only 15 mins but you had 45 mins between 2 flights. For domestic flights Well this is a short one. You are arriving at the airport 70 mins before the flight and arriving at the counter 5758 mins before the flight. You will walk only 5 mins to reach the gate after the counter. But they are telling you sir you shouldve been here 60 mins before. So you buy another ticket from another airline. General Food was a disaster. Not only because of pandemic considerations but also managed poorly and their attitude confirms their current position. As common sense If it takes 25 mins to walk to the transfer gate and if there are both passport and security check then you dont assign 1 hour between flights. Easy. Not worth your money.
BCNTUNBCN on Economy. Flight was punctual on both legs. The plane was a relatively old Airbus 320. Cabin announcements in Spanish Arabic and French. A full meal was served in the outbound flight and a breakfast on the return flight which were very tasty. Staff didnt seem to be very motivated but were efficient in all cases.
Allegiant staff was exceptional. They were kind efficient and very friendly. Hadnt flown for 25 years and they made it enjoyable. Would fly Allegiant again.
We have booked flight to Chumpon for a big group of over 20 person since early last year but was cancelled due to Covid19 epidemic. Therefore we have to postpone flight to October 2021 but was cancelled by Air Asia only 2 weeks before flight. Then we move the flight to February 2022 but was informed again the the flight was cancelled without certain date. Desperately we change the destination to fly to Surat Thani on February 10 2022 and plan to drive back to Chumphon. Incredibly Air Asia cancelled the flight to Surat Thani again without good reason.
Do not use Air France if you have another option We were scheduled to leave Italy at 6.10 am on July 12 to catch a connecting flight in Paris to JFK. The night before they changed our flight to 7.45 am so we would miss our connecting flight. Instead of scheduling the next available flight from Paris to JFK they changed our connecting flight multiple times and in the end we had a 14 hour delay in the airport. No one communicated the reason for this long delay we can only assume that they gave our seats away to the passengers that had already been stuck in the airport for 2448 hours for a plane to JFK. The only compensation Air France offered us was a 31 food voucher for five passengers to hold us over for a fourteen hour delay. It is apparent that this airline is not at all prepared to accommodate the influx of passengers flying their airline and definitely does not respect their passengers time. We will never fly this airline again
Business class seating shown as a 2x2 configuration on the website is economy style with an unsold middle seat not much more comfortable than economy. Meal service started with three options but was down to 2 options by row 5 out of 8 in business class and by row 6 where we were seated only one of us had 2 options then only grilled tofu was available for the rest of business class.
The first and last time I fly with this airline. I understand it is a low cost airline but to not provide even water in a 6 hour flight is unbelievable. Besides the staff was full of attitude and didnt show a little gesture of kindness at first I thought it was just bad luck with an employee however after the second flight I understood it is a requirement to get hired have no manners. The best happened when we landed in Dammam Saudi Arabia being around 240 people in the aircraft approximately 150200 needed to get a connection flight however because the airline apparently doesnt have a contract with the airport we were all obliged to pay EUR130 for a transit visa even though none of us would step in the country. This was absolutely ridiculous and we got the explanation from the local authorities that they daily faced that issue of people flying with WizzAir. Nothing was ever explained in the reservations email which should have been detailed even prior of making the booking. As per my experience it was a given that when you are flying internationally and have everything ready for your next flight you just have to cross de International transfer door at the airport however Wizz Air had a wonderful surprise for us. I was lucky and did not miss my flight but I will definitely pay extra next time to travel with a decent airline.
Taipei to Hong Kong they only provide one cake and one juice for this flight which left me disappointed. I will choose other airlines to Hong Kong or Macau for my flight.
Newark to Orly plane was old but relatively clean. My seat was broken and did not recline. The flight was sold out and I was forced to sit perfectly straight for the entire flight and I landed exhausted. They say 100 satisfaction but that is not true. Despite several calls and letters I was offered nothing for my discomfort. I would not fly with them again customer service was terrible the experience poor.
Checkin counters opened 2 hours before the flight and a queue formed as early as an hour before the counters opened. Being a PPS club member was able to queue at business class queue even though I flew economy. The ground crew had a list of the names allowed to queue in the business class check in queue and those who were not flying business class or PPS club members were asked to queue in the economy class queue which made the line short. Ground crew and flight crew very friendly. Route was via Cebu and was invited to use the lounge in both Davao and Cebu which had decent food options. Flight crew very professional and friendly even though it was an almost full load in economy. One complaint is that they run out of food options early and those at the rear only had one choice of food left. Crew very apologetic but this is not the first time this happened on SilkAir happened in my inbound leg to Davao too. Both food options were good though. Didnt try the entertainment system and most passengers chose to sleep through the flight. It was an enjoyable flight and am so glad that they have this very convenient connection between Singapore and Davao.
I booked a flight to Asia with them from LAX and they canceled one day before the actual flight changed the flight to another one 10 days later. I had to spend hours just to try to speak to someone on 5 different lines of communication messenger only and hours later they would say oh as a courtesy we wont charge any fees to change but you only get one change despite the cancelation and flight change being 100 their fault and offered dates that were still 5 days from the original date. No reimbursements no apologies as the agent kept stating that he would cancel my itinerary instead of answering my questions on alternative available flights as he kept saying until you have a definite answer. I ended up having to request a full cancelation and refund so I could book an immediate international flight leaving the next day costing me much more and the agent has said that the refund will be completed in 90 days after initiating the refund request. While looking up more on their policies there are multiple reviews of customers stating their experiences with sudden cancelations and delays and how they still have not received their refunds. Just do your research and due diligence but I cannot trust nor will use Philippine Airlines again.
Frankfurt to Tunis. Online Checkin was possible through the Tunisair website. The website had issues being available at some hours of the day during that period the TU server did not respond. Once accessed though the procedure was fast and simple. There was no information on lounge access on the electronic boarding pass so proceeded to the checkin area at FRA. TU Checkin area is in Zone C of Terminal 1 and is handled by AHS. When asked about lounge access the AHS agent did not seem to know at first. I was then directed to use the Priority pass lounge located in the first floor area C before the security area which is most inconvenient. The lounge was partially under construction. Very basic commodities poor food quality potato salad potato soup and frankfurter sausages. Lousy internet reception of the main FRA internet access provided freely through Tmobile. only salvation was a good coffee machine. Left the lounge early to ensure I go through security and immigration procedures on time before boarding. Boarding was handled by bus most times for TU out of FRA. Boarding was smooth although no announcements were made to ensure boarding by zones classes and for families with kids rather a general announcement was made for a general boarding of a full flight. Aircraft was a A319. Business class configuration was 22 with larger and seemingly more comfortable seats than economy class seats. It is a plus for this type of leg. LH and other TU flights on this leg offer a 33 regular economy class configurations with a blocked seat in the middle. The aircraft looked tired dirty floors and dirty walls and panels. There is a PTV in the arm rest which I did not try so I am not sure if it worked. Now that catering is back to Tunisair the meal service was good for this type of flight with a salad smoked salmon mushroom a hot offering with a selection of a beef or a seafood dish. I chose the seafood option which was quite tasty and nice. Meal service was accompanied with a beverage service. Champagne wines were offered. TU serves Piper Heidsieck Rose at this time of the day. A great choice. Although the crew member was nice throughout the meal service there was only one crew member working the Business class section of 12 passengers she seemed to be a bit overwhelmed forgetting requests for beverage refills etc. There was a single beverage service throughout the meal until coffee. Not even another offering of water. The meal service was overall good considering the length of the flight. Overall the crew members were nice smiling and very helpful. What ever imperfection I noted I would attribute to a lack of training and the absence of clear direction as to how to handle a meal service. This is truly a flaw in the quality system of the airline and lack of training. Not blaming crew members as individuals. All announcements were made in Arabic and German. Nothing in English including the safety announcements and demonstration. English should be added. Another illustration of breakdown in SOPs and lack of quality systems. This flight was overall pleasant. Tunisair has potential. Attention to cleanliness and training for inflight service is needed.
LCYSNNJFKLCY BA001 and 004. Quick check in and fast track security although I had to show my boarding pass to get expedited. Gate 24 lounge with a view of our aircraft and a glass of champagne. Quick boarding nice welcome by a familiar face. Cabin has stood up well and is as fresh as it was on introduction. Starter choice to Shannon now replaced by a selection of canapes served on a plate. USA immigration straight forward and soon back on the aircraft but the airport is soulless. Once in the air salad drinks and a choice of mains. I had the curry which was excellent followed by chocolate fondant smothered in chocloate sauce bliss. Later on the Friday 001 flight which departs at 1245 as opposed to 0945 they serve supper rather than afternoon tea. This was a plate of cold cuts and samosas.Tasty.Quick disembarkation lovely crew. Return on 004 Sunday evening supper in the busy Galleries dining room. then quick boarding on this full 3132 flight. Supper served to those who wanted it and then a full hot English breakfast option or a bag to go. Bussed to the arrivals hall and immigration and then home in 15 minutes. Excellent crew and flight.
The short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for. We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the Points game but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure when they were still available rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after takeoff a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Takeoff was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again No not if I had half a chance of going with another airline.
For the last couple months I have been dissatisfied with the service. There has been delays upon my trip back home. I can understand an hour but to have to sit in the airport for 7 hours is ridiculous. When you are not being told substantial reason is even more unacceptable. This is an inconvenience to me as I have other important things to take care of. In addition having to come at the initial time frame of the original flight is even more ridiculous. Having to come to the airport at 200pm and not leaving until after 930pm does not make any sense to me. I have been flying with JetBlue for years and it seems like the services is getting worse. There is more fees added and decrease in adequate services. I am going to have to take my service elsewhere.
Lovely staff lovely aircraft. Very spacious for a budget airline really enjoyed my flight. Cabin crew were very polite and the airport staff very efficient and quick.
Dont fly Islena in Honduras if you can fly Sosa instead. We flew Islena from San Pedro Sula to Roatan via La Ceiba. When we arrived in La Ceiba we watched our plane being towed away and were not told anything. Our 20 minute layover exceeded 2 hours. At no time were we told anything by Islena staff. There were no staff members to help us and we were restricted to a room without food or drink. Exactly one week later we were delayed in Roatan for over 3 hours without any explanation. Occasionally an announcement was made in Spanish that said the plane was coming soon. We know they were lying because the flight time from La Ceiba to Roatan is only 15 minutes. In the meantime the Sosa planes came and went.
Lufthansa economy seems to work out to be more expensive then its premium economy option by charging extra fees for everything under the sun. It seems almost disingenuous after seeing the price of very basic amenities stack up to more then you would have paid for a more pricey ticket. All in flight services felt extremely low budget. Everything was hidden behind a pay wall. I payed 18 USD for their second tier fast in flight wifi that would not even suffice to write this review at the time of my flight. The in flight meals were about as basic and cheap as possible. My advice would be to take your chances with another airline. On the only positive note I can think of the flight crew were very friendly.
Johannesburg to Christchurch via Singapore. An amazing experience for us as first time passengers with Singapore Airlines The staff is very friendly and professional dressed and groomed very well. Their communication with passengers makes is a real feel good experience. Their endless efforts were to keep all passengers comfortable and happy The plane was very clean and hygienic. The entertainment for long flights was top quality and a huge variety is available Right from boarding wet hot cloths provides to stepping off the plane was a 1010 experience. Keep it up.
We got ripped off when we went to counter to check in. They said we have to pay 124 because I didnt check in online and I wasnt allowed to check in online at that stage. This is in addition to the delay and poor check in process. The total amount of our ticket was 140 and we paid the same amount just for a check in.
Jakarta to Singapore. I now come back to fly with Singapore Airlines because they are named the best airline of 2018 but the service is the best for sure. The check in to boarding was great as usual. Onboard with a wonderful helping staff and crew. The IFE itself was limited compared to Emirates because its an old airplane with no power plug and smaller screens. The food was beef and rice which was delicious. Overall short flight with Singapore Airlines means the best one ever had. What can I say is to say Thank you to all Singapore Airlines team for this amazing short flight.
The issues I encountered include a significant problem with their cancellation policy lack of responsiveness from their customer service team concerning safety practices refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage an extensive delay during the return flight and a stark contrast in service quality between Economy and Business class. Regarding the cancellation policy I received misleading information from three representatives who assured me that I would receive a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours. However they failed to mention the crucial condition that this only applied when the flight was at least 7 days after the initial booking. As a result I tried to cancel within the 24hour window but could only reschedule. This cost me a 500 loss vs. the option of cancelling and booking a new flight for the following day. Despite Emirates acknowledging in writing their mistake they repeatedly refused to provide a price match or refund and eventually even stopped replying to my follow up messages on the open complain. The lack of responsiveness from Emirates compounded my frustration. Numerous followup messages went unanswered showing a lack of interest in resolving the issues I faced. During the flight I was alarmed by a safety practice where all blankets were collected and piled in front of the emergency exits. Emirates also declined to reimburse me for one of two damaged pieces of luggage despite the damage occurring during their handling. Furthermore the return flight experienced a significant delay for a missing document resulting in passengers being seated on the plane for over two hours including boarding time. Despite the delay being just a few minutes short of two hours the lack of updates assistance and provisions such as free WiFi or refreshments left passengers feeling inconvenienced and neglected. The service quality and care for Economy class travelers fall short of expectations.
They dont let you check in until 2 hours before the flight and created a huge line. On the way here we missed our connecting flight because they were scheduled too close together and they blamed us. They forced us to check our carry on bag and charged us 70 euros when we carried our bag on the previous flight. It was bought as a carry on bag and they refused to let us carry it on without paying. The flight attendants ignore call lights. Couldnt get a drink of water on a 7 hour flight. Worst airline ever. Dont fly with them if you want a relaxing stress free flight.
We paid for the seat for better leg space. But the staff name at the check in counter cancelled our seat and we were sent to the supervisor who was equally rude . After which we have to mail the airline for the refund to which also there is no response. This is the most unprofessional airline. If the seat has been cancelled by your staff for what so ever reason isnt it your duty to refund it back . Why should we write a separate mail and keep waiting for our refund.
Doha to Paris in August 2017. No amenity kit in economy class. The flight attendants told me that amenities are only given on more than 9 hr duration flights and not on a 7 hr daytime flight. Nevertheless in most of the flight the attendants pulled down the window shade. A pitiful breakfast was served and quality and quantity was miserable. Entertainment was average. A very dry snack was given before landing in Paris.
Kuala Lumpur to Brisbane via Denpasar. I didnt had change money only i had 100 USD dollars with me to buy a water bottle i was really thirsty by that time as i was on a 10 hours long transit. When i was asking for a water bottle using that 100 USD one staff member told me miss i dont have change. I admit the fact that i should have bring change money but i was only asking for water not food or beverage. After 4 or 5 hours i again asked for a cup of water and this this lady told me that it is 34 malaysian rupees even knowing that i dont have change and specially she was in the kitchen and pouring some water on a small cup was not that hard. Very inhuman and cheap staff manners. I was shocked after experiencing this and i decided not to travel anymore on this airline.
Flew Air France from Paris to Shanghai. This was probably one of the best flights I have had. First of all ground services were very careful and warned me about some delays unrelated to this airline. The new Air France Business Class is done with good taste and comfort. The seat becomes a real bed and the seat configuration enables passangers to have access to the aisle without bothering other passangers. The catering was outstanding. Food tasted the way it should taste. The selection of drinks and wines were remarkable. Crew were polite and professional yet discreet.
Fort de France to Paris. 8.5 hours flight on a 13 year old Boeing 777 FGSQR. The personnel was courteous and professional but they could not make up for my miserable experience. Very uncomfortable seats little to no space for the legs and for the shoulders plastic head rest that makes you sweat your neck. AC barely working its been hot the whole flight. Entertainment system with a screen that was slow sluggish. No outlet or USB port to recharge your device. My food was lowaverage in quality. My partner is pregnant 6th month and there was no possibility to select another more comfortable seat for her there is no correspondence between the service received and the price paid which is premium.
London to Muscat first class. First time trying out first class on BA. Checkin was fairly quick and efficient didnt have much luggage but the first wing did not feel very exclusive. I had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as I got printed boarding pass. Concorde room was nice well designed but quite crowded in some places. Had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace before it got served a good 20 minutes later. Checkout out the cabana for an hour which was not very appealing at all and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment I booked for the Spa. Onboard was informed there was a problem with the Seat I had selected and was issued a new aisle seat which was disappointing. Upon entering the first class cabin I had a quick look at the seat and it was not immediately apparent there was something wrong. I asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that I will indeed not be able to sit there but there was no explanation of what was wrong given. I did not want to waste any time to settle in the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read. Seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private with a small wardrobe to hang jacket. The TV screen seemed quite large and high quality. Unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive and neither was the remote for the TV. Soon after take off I was informed I could eat when I like. Arabic starter was great. Had preselected main meal online. Meal was of good quality and cooked well. Had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate not as good as other cheese Ive had in some Business class. Surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection I imagine on two ultralong flights in the same month one might run out of anything of interest to watch. After finishing the one film I decided to watch I decided to try get some sleep. Crew made the bedding while I tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom. Bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough. I missed breakfast as I was still rather full from the dinner and predinner at the lounge. Overall I was reasonably happy with the flight and the product. The crew were very friendly and professional. Given this was first class have to admit there was no wow factor either with the soft product or ground experience. I managed to book flights for a good price during a promo otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight.
Delhi to Hong Kong. We arrived about 3 hours in advance for our flight just to have some barrier time in case anything goes wrong. Once through our ID check and into the terminals we checked our flight on the board and headed towards check in. There was a lady at the front of most of the cues and checked our boarding pass as we proceeded to the Business class cue. I was quite surprised there was no first class on this flight as I couldnt see any such check in counter. Normally on a 777 they do have one. Queue was fairly short and efficient. Our baggage got tagged priority and we were given our boarding passes. Once exiting check in we headed to a first class and business class security and immigration lane which is meant to fast track premium passengers. CX use the Plaza Premium lounge here at Delhi and we took the lift to the concourse and entered in. Lounge was pretty crowded but still comfortable if your not to picky. Onboard the seat was fairly comfortable and had a decent privacy divider and ample storage space. The amenity kit had all the amenities you could need. Im pretty happy CX provided two blankets and which were very comfortable. I was given a hot towel. CX use StudioX for there IFE and there was a decent amount of movies and Tv shows. After a movie I decided to order one of their steak options which was pretty disappointing. I left it and was gonna go with the biryani but was full. I decided to get some shut eye the bed could go fully flat and was pretty comfortable.
Kozhikode to Bahrain. I chose to fly Gulf Air business class since it had been many years since I last flew with them. I upgraded my tickets to Business Class to avail the extra baggage and smooth check in services at Bahrain Airport. The flight was disappointing in many ways. There was no Movies available on the Entertainment system just old TV series that were quite boring. The food was good but nothing outstanding. The seats are old and dont really go all the way back and the food rest is quite hard to pull out. Also they didnt let us board first for some reason.
Dubai to Manchester. Specifically chose this flight so that we could travel on the A380. Very disappointed. Boarding was OK and we were in seats 12EF. Seats were a little narrow and widthways was restricted nowhere to rest your elbows unless you used the bulkheads on either side The floor ahead of the seat had a ridge in it which made it uncomfortable to stretch your legs out. Plane was 30 minutes late leaving due to one runway being out of use. Cabin service was very poor and disjointed. Starters were served and the mains did not arrive for twenty minutes. We were not offered tea or coffee after the meal and had to ask twice for it to be served I gave up in the end. Times must be hard on Emirates only one chocolate between us The bar area at the rear of business cabin is the place to go if you want a drink at least you get one there eventually. The pilot managed to make up the lost time and arrived in Manchester bang on time. Much prefer the A340 or Boeing 777 to this plane. We have the same trip booked later this year and I am wondering if I can change to another flight to avoid the A380.
No sympathy for a customer at all. I flew from Durban to Johannesburg had a layover of 2h 15mins before flying to Angola. I had a negative covid results from a government clinic had sma confirming my results only to be told that was not allowed. I had to call the lab to send me one with a QR code. While we were waiting for results the boarding pass closed. Later i asked if they can assist they told me i was supposed to change dates an hour before but they never suggested that to me then when i emailed them later they told me the staff suggested i change the dates and I refused. I did admit I didnt know that covid results wasnt allowed as at clinic they assured me it was ok. Customer care is worse. I wouldnt suggest anyone to fly with this airline.
They incorrectly notified me that my flight was cancelled when it wasnt causing me to incur more than 500 in fees to reschedule my travel plans. And when I called to confirm the first time I spent 1 hour on hold only to be disconnected and the next time over 2 12 hours to speak to a representative. This airline is totally understaffed and unable to handle any customer service. Check in lines were also absurdly long and the plane so tight with the seat in font of you right in your face and no leg room due to electrical boxes at your feet. Totally miserable flights and then flight attendant put my jacket under a bag and I didnt see it leaving it on the plane. No one to contact and emails go unanswered.
Recently flew from Phnom Penh to Washington via Seoul in their Prestige Class joined First and Business into one the flight from Phnom Penh to Seoul was approx 5 hours and none eventful Slept most of the way the flight from Seoul to Washington was a nice flight overall with one of the smoothest landing I have had in a number of years well done captain. The crew is a different story they have a preset menu that includes steak after ordering the steak medium rare I understand English is a secondary language but it took an effort to order including having to point at the menu for the item. Approx 10 min later they came back and told me that they had run out and I needed to order something else a bit annoyed but I complied I was in row 9 after the flight speaking with one of my traveling companions the did the same thing to him and he was up in row 5 or 6. I had red wine with dinner when the meal was complete my tray top was cleared without even the offer of a refill on the wine however I did notice that on the far side of the cabin they were walking up and down offer to that side. I know I could have requested a refill but when you are paying full fare for round trip tickets close to 12K you shouldnt have too. If an item is offered on the menu it should be available.
I had paid for my baggage over the phone i have my credit card charged but they never entered it in their system and I had to pay for the baggage again. Now Ill have to spend time to dispute it and may not get refund. It appears Canada does not have a decent airline. I try to avoid traveling as much as possible
Luang Prabang to Vientiane in a brand new Airbus with a spotlessly clean and bright cabin Typically friendly Lao cabin crew were always attentive. Spot on punctual.
Firstthe flight was rescheduled from 10.10pm departure to 12.20am due to no pilots to fly the plane. Boarding starting at midnight and was fully boarded before the pilots showed up first pilot at 12.20am and second pilot at 12.24am. Secondonly a blanket was available for each passenger no pillows available on an allnight flight. Thirdno beverages were made available even in first class. Fourthat no time did any of the crew apologize for the delay or for the lack of amenities. Fifththe plane itself had no electronics available at all no video screens and no outlets for electronics truly very Spartan. Sixthat 7am EDT the first beverages were offered along with the first class continental breakfast which consisted of a small croissant roll a packet of almond butter a small tube of strawberry preserves a wedge of cheese and a mint not first class at all. Sevenththe flight landed and we left the aircraft at 8.58am EDT. In summary I would not recommend US Airways as a source to use for nighttime intercontinental flights. It was a ridiculous example of airline management and treatment of customers.
London Heathrow to Brussels. Disappointed by the non existent service onboard this flight. Regardless of how short the flight may well be you expect some sort of refreshmentssnacks to be provided given this isnt a low carrier airline. However BA have hit rock bottom in that they charge premium rates but give low carrier service certainly on short haul flights.
Cheongju to Jeju with Jeju Air. Boeing 737800 aircraft. Efficient budget airline quick boarding checking in was quick and easy. On board clean cabin not very noisy friendly crew just half a cup of juice for a short flight about 40 min on time. Short on leg space. No entertainment.
ITA Airways is actually worse than Alitalia which is saying a lot. I know from experience as a frequent flyer on Alitalia over the last 20 years. My ITA flight was cancelled and rescheduled several hours later allowing me to be in Milan for 1 hour before returning on a business day trip. When contacted for a refund as the ticket was completely useless the airline placed me on hold for 30 minutes only to come back saying they could not refund me as I purchased my ticket in the Netherlands. This is absurd as it was purchased directly from their website. I was given a number to call in the NL which did not exist. When I called back another 30 minute wait I was told to write a complaint to an email address that did not exist and came back to me undeliverable. I managed to find the proper complaints and refunds email addresses on their website and explained my situation. I received a reply 5 days later telling me to call the very same customer service number I had already spoken with. Truly the most insane runaround I have ever experienced with an airline. The worst and most ill informed customer service possible. Astounding that absolutely no one would help me address my request or even care to rectify the situation. I was passed along from person to person who had absolutely no intention of helping me. My ticket was cancelled and not refunded by ITA airways. Be warned ITA Airways is an appalling company and should be avoided at all costs.
I arrived to the checkout point 2 hours before the takeoff time and they wouldnt let me board because there was an overbooking they said. They basically sold more tickets than the right number of the passengers. I had to miss an important meeting because of them. I had a direct flight and they compensated me with a transit flight. Dont fly with them if you plan to travel on the flight you actually booked.
Shocking service on arrival from London Heathrow. An attendant shouted at the arriving passengers all African passengers this way. We were literally herded like cattle to one terminal. There was one very basic canteen serving hot drinks in polystyrene cups. I asked a very rude attendant if I could go to the main part of the airport to shop and enjoy a meal. He pointed at a No Entry sign and walked away.
The plane was quite comfortable with wide seats and ample leg room. I prefer Plays planes that Ive flown 6 times so far over the more compact seating. The overhead compartment is also nice and large. I would like a hard cider on the menu but I have had canned soda and a canned vodka seltzer drink. The soda was flat but the vodka seltzer was really good. The crew is very pleasant. Our flight back to BWI was moved up due to weather and it was very windy. There was a minor maintenance item that held us up for 1015 minutes and then we rocked our way into the sky. I dont mind that there are no seat screens or power outlets. I downloaded my own movies and used my phone and own headphones on the plane.
Mauritius to Vienna via Paris. Paris airport is a total disaster. Nobody knows anything everyones highly inefficient and incompetent. Nobody cares. We missed our connection flight 2 out of 2 times. The BB they made available to us was a shack. They also lost our checked in baggage. Worst airport Ive ever been to. By far Also wifi does not work even though its advertised everywhere.
After a long time and being French I decided to give a chance to Air France. Unfortunately this has been a disaster they ruined our vacation. We came to Paris for 5 days for the 60th birthday of my mother in law on a direct flight from Dubai. Air France succeed to lose the luggage of my wife with all her clothes gift etc.. Moreover since yesterday I have been trying to call customer services to see where our luggage is however I have been on hold twice for more than an hour and 15 min. This is unacceptable to have such bad service coming from a reputed airline company and no one is capable of giving you an answer.
It is really meant to fly as the service for the customers so immense and caretaking. The hospitality with pride for anyone who really matters either business class nor the economy class. I suggest anyone try Qatar Airways.
Douala to Dubai via Entebbe. Our visitor arrived at Douala three hours prior to her flight. Airline staff informed her that the aircraft had technical problems and the flight was rescheduled to the following day. They provided accommodation and she arrived at the airport the following day. Without explanation our traveler was denied boarding and was informed that there was a problem with her ticket and that it would need to be modified or that a completely new ticket would have to be purchased. No other help was provided and the next customer was assisted. After hours of long distance calls to Rwandair and also to the travel agency headquarters in New York and 30 hours in limbo no assistance was received from Rwandair and the agency told us that Rwandair had updated their system to reflect that the traveler was a no show at the airport and subsequent flights were all canceled. At best employees are poorly trained and incompetent.
Would not refund me during COVID19 epidemic. A few weeks ago I was going to cancel my flight due to the COVID virus thats hitting NYC Which is where Im from obviously flights got cancelled and just a few weeks ago I was able to cancel my flight from the page but I only didnt just to wait it out to see if they would cancel it themselves. Now the cancellation page isnt working and they refused to refund me. Their policy says you can cancel for a refund with a fee. Now I cant even cancel at ALL the page literally doesnt go to the cancellation page anymore.
I fly Manchester London City with VLM on most Friday mornings the 9.30 am flight and it appears to be a reliable service. Wheels up is normally at 9.45 and you are on the ground again at 10.30. A good price of 41 all inclusive is available if you book about 3 weeks in advance. It is not a lot quicker than the train for city centre to city centre travel but in my case I am going from South Manchester to Essex and there is an hours time saving.
Flew Qatar Airways from Sao Paulo to Athens via Doha. Boarding took place on time and in an organized manner. The aircraft has economy class seats more comfortable than most companies. The food served is of good quality and the service very friendly. The bathrooms are cleaned constantly which is very important for a 15 hour trip. I really enjoyed the trip.
New York JFK to Milan. Well I do not use to review my flights Im a frequent flyer with more than 30 trips per year but during this flight I cannot hide my disappoint. The lounge on board service comfort food are perfect but before departure I was one of the first to took my seat and I went into the toilet and there was a terrible smell inside so this means they didnt clean the toilet after the previous flight. I cannot accept this on Emirates especially on Business Class where the ticket costs at least three times more than the coach.
Montreal to Toronto. The customer service is rude and they lied about the size of carryon luggage so they can charge you more money. They charge you small carry on luggage as long as the luggages have wheels. In the end you will pay more than any other airlines.
Birmingham to Amritsar via Ashgabat with Turkmenistan Airlines. Flight time was moved forward by a few hours and we were not notified. When we arrived at airport they were already boarding the aircraft. Fortunately we could still check in and did not miss our flight to India. Staff are a bit disorganised. Seats were allocated so couples sat on opposite ends of the aircraft which did not make any sense. The return flight was due to leave at 9am but did not depart until later in the afternoon. We were not provided with any refreshment or information during the long delay. The aircrew were miserable. No in flight entertainment and food was average to tasteless. The curry spice foods are too spicy hot to eat. If delayed for 5 hours they should have at least provided fresh water and sandwiches in the airport free of charge. No apology partial refund or refreshments were given.
Flew Gatwick to Kingston 13315 return 27315 big disappointment had to climb over strangers legs to leave seats. Not all options of food available if your at the end of the meal run. Need to pay to sit together separated from my husband who was next to a nice bloke who was happy to move so we could sit together BA did not even try to accommodate us. Not worth the money Virgin far superior from their lounge to the flight. Will never travel BA long haul again be warned dont waste your money.
London Stansted to Stuttgart Germany. Return. More than satisfied with both legs of the flight. I expected an Easyjet type arrangement but GW are definitely better. Flight attendants were snarly though on outbound leg but it was only an hours trip. Food on board should be avoided though.
I got to the airport 1 hour and 30 minutes early with only a carry on and they couldnt print out my boarding pass. The employee had to call IT and their supervisor. They finally issued a manual pass 35 minutes before my flight was supposed to depart. Ended up getting all the way through to the plane being told i would make it just to get there and be told that no one authorized to hold the plane. I sat there for 15 minutes watching my plane just sit there before starting to move. The employees are no help either. They told me to call customer service and that theyve been noted of everything that happened. The service rep told me that the only note was they issued me a manual pass when I got there a hour and a half early and that it was my fault that I missed it. Again they issued me the manual ticket 35 minutes before my flight was supposed to depart. They take absolutely no responsibility and said they dont need to refund the flight or the hotel for the extra night Id have to stay because i didnt get there 2 hours early. Even the employee who wrote me the manual ticket said none of this was my fault but i could not find him afterwards for him to tell the rep.
Absolutely horrendous. Canceled our return flight. Didnt tell us. Waited at airport until 5am dealing with staff. They ordered us a taxi home which never came. Returned to desk to find they had closed. Finally offered compensation in February to which I agreed and no correspondence since. Do not fly with this airline. They caused huge distress showed no customer care whatsoever and essentially lied about compensation. Never ever again.
Worst airline I have experienced. Not only is the security detail so annoying with all the interrogations. But the worst part is my baggage. 5 days into Israel and no baggage. I have important stuff in there. My Christmas has been completely ruined. Every contact number they give me doesnt work or tells me to call this other place only to tell me there is nothing they can do but keep checking. Ive contacted them via Facebook messenger whatsapp and I dont even use whatsapp. Ive sent emails I have a file number but what good will that do This airline and airport is a Joke no respect for their flyers or customers.
Nouakchott to Dakar. The new Nouakchott airport is about 30 min from the city and opened only 2 years ago. Pretty efficient airport not crowded and only 7 gates. The lounge was surprisingly good English spoken fast WiFi and a decent selection of food and beverages Mauritania is a dry country. The plane was less then a year old but very poor maintained. The whole seating arrangement was mixed up. Seat itself was old and relatively clean. No welcome drink amenities or InFlight magazine. Hot meal was served on a 40 min flight. Only coffee was served no other options. The toilet had no soap nor towels. Many passengers eat their meal with bare hands. Crew was friendly but didnt speak English. Not flag carrier worthy airline but for African standards pretty cheap and the hard product is pretty new. Service in business class to Easyjet economy.
Dalaman to Luton. This has to be the most uncomfortable trip I have ever made legroom was a huge issue as there wasnt any. This flight was operated by Avion Express although the Thomas Cook livery was everywhere. The flight attendants seemed to be having a bad day with one in particular very snappy and barking orders at passengers and then shaking her head and making comments about them just loud enough to be heard. The food was typical of any airline and had to be prepaid. I havent used Thomas Cook in a number of years and now I remember why.
Krakow to Brisbane via Dubai. I booked with Emirates because I seen their good reviews online and didnt want to risk it with a budget airline. I paid an absolute fortune for my ticket home and was very disappointed with the whole experience. Emirates made their partner airline who I flew first with FlyDubai who are very poorly ratedreviewed look like a premium airline. I could go on and list all the bad things but the most important thing you need to know is that they gave me a severe bout of food poisoning It was a 13 hour flight and food poisoning symptoms occur in a very specific time window so it HAD to be something I ate on the flight. Completely unacceptable. Never again.
Avoid at all costs They cancelled my flight and put me on one that didnt work so requested a refund end of March 2022 and it is now April 2023 and still not received They dont answer you or when they do its the usual your refund is being processed This company is nothing but glorified thieves Avoid.
We travelled around South America on 8 different flights with LAN and had the same issues on most of our flights. We were travelling with a 5 month old baby. My complaints about LAN Airlines Staff are rude unhelpful and untrained at dealing with customers. They dont want to accommodate people with babies. Staff lie to customers. Not once but on several occasions. I needed to confirm 3 times that we would need a bassinet and were told we would get one three times. On arrival to the airport they said we didnt get one anyway. Bassinets were available on flight but LA801 a 13 hour flight but no one with babies got them. Normal economy people were sitting in those seats. I have never seen babies sitting on parents laps when bassinets were available. It states on their website that we have a right to get a bassinet and it is the safest place for babies. I would like to add that we were talking to other parents with young a babies and none of us got bassinets. One parents werent even sitting together one other was travelling by herself and they woult even make the seat next to her free. They all had the same issues as it. Long checkins Dealing with rude and unhelpful staff LAN Airlines saying no bassinets and unable to help etc.
Flew Singapore to Port Moresby. Air Niugini replaced their own decent 767s with a charter from euroAtlantic Air Niugini seems to be having ongoing maintenance issues and it was terrible. 767s are normally pretty spacious but the legroom on this one was awful with my knees wedged against the seat in front. Furthermore there was an enormous IFE box that took up more than 40 I measured of the room under the seat in front of me. Of course the box was used only to show 4 or 5 movies on fixed schedules on a tiny screen and for the second 3 hours of the flight none of the movies were playing. The fitout generally seemed 15 years old although not worn as I guess charter usage causes less wear. There was also a foul smell coming from the toilets and the aircon seemed set higher than the stated 23 degrees no individual vents available. The only good news was that it was operated by Air Niugini staff who are reasonably good. You might not have a choice in flying euroAtlantic when theyre filling in for another airline but you ever get a choice stay away its clearly meant for packing in hordes of lowpaying passengers.
Sydney to Milan via Doha. My plane from Sydney landed 45 minutes late in Doha due to bad weather. We had to reach the terminal on a bus which took quite some time and for my flight to Milan we were told boarding was closed. The next flight was 7 hours later which ruined my travel plans. It was in the middle of the night and all we got offered was a voucher for a restaurant no offer for a room to have a rest. I was forced to try and sleep in one of the Quiet rooms with pretty uncomfortable lounges and announcements every 10 minutes. They show these connecting flights but theres no effort to guarantee a connection that would only require a small delay for the second flight. Flights were quite good but this sort of behavior ruined the experience.
Do not take this airline. We had two small carry ons for our short flight from Marrakesh to Fez but they would not allow us to take them. My friend had to check in his carry on. The reasoning They claimed it was a full flight but we knew that was untrue upon entering the airplane the flight was only half full and there was ample space for baggage in the overhead bins. The people who checking in before us didnt have this issue. In fact no one else was asked to do this except for my friend. To top this experience off our seating arrangement was not honored even though we paid extra to have specific seats next to each other. They were randomly assigned seats totally separate from each other. Luckily the flight was contrary to airline staff only half full so we seated ourselves. When traveling within Morocco take the train.
I rarely post reviews about anything but this one tops one of the worst experiences Ive ever had. Within 5 minutes of boarding the flight the passenger in front of me attempts to recline her seat so far back she bangs it against my knees. She continues doing so over and over again and of course cannot recline because my knees are in the way no fault of my own She proceeds to call the stewardess and tell her that her seat isnt reclining. The stewardess addresses me and starts explaining that it is the passengers right to recline her chair. I explain that while I understand that it is her right I cannot do anything about my legs being there I simply cannot move my legs The stewardess and the passenger both gang up on me and the stewardess continues with the same speech that the passenger has every right to recline. At this point I am frustrating and keep explain the same thing I have no space The stewardess then engages a random passenger in the same row who is completely unrelated to this situation and says Do you not agree that it is her right to recline her seat At this point I dont engage them anymore because I know they can simply kick me off the flight if the feel like it. The passenger then changes seats and for the remainder of the flight the stewardess does not give me and my friend any service what so ever for 6.5 hours. Barry looking at us or offering to take our trash or anything if that sort. Never again Air Transat
Excellent flight with British Airways from London Heathrow to Singapore Changi. Boeing 777300 was a great aircraft and must have been nearly new. Wonderful staff onboard and good food. British Airways continues to set high standards. We look forward to our next flights with you.
The checkin was a bit hesitant since the staff acted a bit uncoordinated and the staff were not well presorted by boarding numbers. Especially in a destination with a lot of older travelers not really well organized and prepared. The flight and the aircraft used were in excellent condition and there were no complaints.
Pathetic check in and ground service at Hong Kong airport. Instead of reference they ask for a ticket number. Ok provided. Check in not allowed. Transferring through Hong Kong from another airline. No problem Ill go to the transfer counter. They tell me transfer counter is only for Cathay Pacific. I need to go through immigration and check back in. Aisle K. So I run through the airport through immigration and customs back upstairs to check in get terrible attitude from the check in staff. Staff on the plane are very nice but come on guys. Get your stuff together. Or at least tell your passengers what to expect. Never again with Hong Kong Airlines
Upon booking my flight they recommended a 12 transit stopover at Abu Dhabi airport with the promise that they will provide a hotel. After months of chasing them to say the website is showing an error invalid PNR even though ticket was issued and confirmed they completely ignored my emails made me run around kept buying time eventually telling me I had to book after I completed my first leg which I did. and when I arrived at the airport and said I have been trying for months they acknowledged that I had in fact talked to them but still proceeded to refuse me a hotel. I had to end up paying from my pocket and all this time that I spent chasing them up was completely wasted. I asked if there is an office or desk in the airport where I can lodge a complaint they said theres none Terrible service will not fly with them again.
Easyfly from Pereira to Medellin. Dont take it if you are a tourist Booked and payed online more than a month ago and only once arrived at the check in they told me my booking was cancelled although the money were charged on my bank account. I had to pay a higher price to fly. None at the check in or call center speaks basic English.
Im a mother of a 4 month baby boy I chose Brussels Airlines to be my first travel with a small baby thinking they will provide comfort for me and him. I had paid for an infant ticket around 100 so they should provide at least a bassinet well no On boarding in Brussels Airport I asked the counter lady if I can sit in front seat to have a bassinet as my baby is only 4 months She apologized that there were no seats left in front. The economy class was full full and crowded they gave me a seat in the middle where there were 4 seats The seat was so uncomfortable. I asked the crew if I can sit in front to have a bassinet they responded that they would see if the ones sitting in front would change places but didnt see them asking though. Anyway the whole flight that was 6.30 hrs my baby was in my hands plus they stopped for an hour in Freetown to have some passengers on board so it was a 7.30 hrs flight with a baby. The flight was full and Im a breastfeeding mother I told the crew I could sit in some premium economy seats which were empty to feed and then return to my seat but they refused They werent responsive at all it was so disappointing I ended up sitting near the bathroom to feed him They asked me to upgrade my ticket and pay extra 350euros to sit in the premium It was my worst trip ever.
I arrived at 5am an hour and 15 min before gate closing. We mentioned this to the staff who seemed on oblivious. 50 minutes in line only to be told they wont let us board. We did not need to deposit bags just pick up our boarding pass. This is now 10 to 6. The monitor showed they are still boarding and terminal one in Schiphol isnt big. No one gave us warnings even tho they claimed they did. Meanwhile the screens still say boarding. We walk over to customer service they were telling us we cant board we can clearly see calls for boarding than final call. Easy could have made. Worst case scenario we wont get it and I still have to buy a second ticket. Which we did but not by them cuz they said they they didnt have any but we found tickets tickets cheaper on another site for way cheaper. I paid 330 euro one way. This cost me 200 for me and my gf. It also wasted our day of our life The counter ladies were seven more rude. Not attempting to help us and even laughing at us and talking down at us like children. While Transavia is a budget airline I never felt this frustrated at the lack of effort and empathy to help its clients.
Our LIAT Barbados to Grenada flight on 3 January 2016 was to leave at 12.30 and arrive less than an hour later. First it was announced as on time. Then we were told that there will be a delay and another announcement was to follow in 30 minutes. The waiting hall then changed. The new ground staff told me that the plane would come from St Vincent and had not even left Kingstown airport. Another announcement would be made in 45 minutes. Luckily I did not trust this information it seemed to be made up. After 20 minutes boarding began. Nobody was able to tell passengers whether their suitcases were on board which is either a sign of ignorance or the lack of any reliable computer system which is worrying these days. Half way to Grenada stewardesses told us that the crew was tired it had come to the limits of their statutory flight time and therefore the flight had to be diverted to Port of Spain Trinidad and this was not know to the crew before departure. Almost all passengers wanted to go to Grenada. Why not change the crew in Barbados or Port of Spain and use the same plane It turned out that we had to find places on other flights and there was no seat on any by LIAT. No arrangement existed with Caribbean Airlines but we were placed on their flight after 9 pm. No LIAT agent took care of us. First everybody said something different then it was left to a young lady lowest in the hierarchy to solve this and she tried hard. It was not her fault. The flight took from 12.30 to 22.00 and all LIAT provided was a food voucher of US8 paying just for a succulent burger. Be warned of this airline. I would say never again. but the problem is that there is often no alternative. LIAT gets funding from island governments and has no competition. Only the latter will bring changes.
My wife and I flew LANTAM from JFK to Sao Paulo and returned from Santiago in February 2015. LANs facilities at JFK are way below standard and they cant handle the slightest problem. While there were weather issues on both ends of our trip they did not justify the poor handling of flights by LAN. On the outgoing flight there were 3 planes loads of passengers waiting at one gate at JFK. This is close to 1000 people all expecting to fly out. It appears LAN only has one gate at JFK. Also they seem to be dependent on American Airlines to service their planes. When something goes wrong like the weather American will of course service their own planes first. The counter staff continually lied to everyone about the situation. The only truthful statement they made was that the flights were not cancelled. When our plane finally was ready to board 7 hours late all 1000 people were trying to figure out what flight was boarding because the lighted sign was wrong and still said all flights were on time. Finally someone taped a paper sign over the lighted sign to say what flight was boarding. Our flight was first of 3 and we were 7 hours late. I have no idea how long the other folks waited. On the return flight the Captain proudly announced we landed at JFK on time. However we sat in the plane for 2.5 hours on the tarmac because there were no gates. Finally to avoid being fined after 3 hours they unloaded us on the tarmac and bussed us to the terminal. Why didnt they do that 2 hours earlier I will never fly LAN in the US again. They dont have the facilities and depend on American which itself is another story. Our experience in South America has been much better. Take American to South America and then fly LAN between cities there.
My experience exceeded my expectations. The flight between San Juan to Frankfurt was fully booked I found staff at checkin pleasant and efficient. Boarding was a little chaotic not clear where to queue up boarding delayed and announcement made that boarding would be in zones but it was really a free for all. This was not an issue as I find that random boarding is better than zone boarding as generally less people are completing for the same space on the aircraft. Ground staff could have managed cabin baggage better as some passengers were bringing more onboard than the 1 bag 8kg small bag onboard. Larger bags do not fit into the middle lockers and need to be placed in the side lockers. I observed several passengers struggling to stow their bags and needed to find space away from their seats but then again some passengers seem very adverse to putting their small bag below the seat in front of them. The flight left about 20mins late and the Pilot made a good announcement to explain why. We arrived on time in Frankfurt. The aircraft was clean with mood lighting lockers and toilets which looked like they had recently been refurbished bright and modern. Im 59 and found the seat width and pitch no different from other airlines economy class. Seat did not have an adjustable headrest but as a pillow and blanket were provided so I found it comfortable for the 9 hour flight and was able to get quite a few hours of sleep. The inflight entertainment was fine limited free moviestv show however the free movie was a recent release and the screen resolution was of a high quality. Bring your own headsets or buy from the crew on board. Premium entertainment can be purchased for 9 Euro and the selection seemed good with a mixture or new releases and favorites. A meal was served about 60 mins after departure and the quantity small salad bread roll hot pasta dish and desert and taste was fine and better than expected for an operator such as Condor. About 90mins before arrival into FRA a light breakfast roll ham cheese and fresh fruit was also good. Soft drinks and teacoffee are free and alcoholic drinks at Euro 5 is reasonable. Crew were fine not overly friendly but efficient meals served and cleared quickly. I observed a crew member during a service drawing a funny face on a napkin for a infant ... nice touch. Overall a good flight and considering the very reasonable fare and some entertainment and meals were included. Im glad I booked Condor and found it good value for money and Id fly them again.
Thomson Airways from Birmingham to Sal Cape Verde and absolutely awful flight arrived over 7 hours late due to a power fault at airport 3 hours and then having to return after 1 hour of flight due to one of three radios having a fault. Then kept waiting on plane and standing on a bus while they decided what to do. Through the entire delay no offer of a drink or food. Total lack of care or interest in passengers comfort and well being felt really sorry for the families and children. On return complaint is treated with disdain and ignored. If you have a choice of another airline go with them.
After travelling London to Madrid with British Airways then with Iberia from Madrid to Lima and LATAM to Cuzco my luggage arrived 7 days after me. When attempting to collect my luggage mine was the only one not to arrive. I sought help and was informed to make a claim online. When my bag finally arrived 7 days later the lock had been forced open and everything inside the case searched. Someone emptied my 1st aid kit and toiletries and threw my clothing about I felt violated. I have been treated appallingly from start to finish. For a month I have been back and forth to British Airways yet they stated it is not their fault.
The conditions in the airplane from Tel Aviv to Brussels and back were terrible No space for legs at all everything is old and dirty no entertainment restrooms are so tiny and very dirty no service which was not mentioned in the reservation. They didnt even serve a glass of water What a disgrace The flight was one big suffrering and everybody was complaining. We will never fly with Brussels Airline again
No online boarding which led to an hour and a half line to check in They took my hand luggage when boarding and told me that you need to pay extra if you want to be sure to have it on board never got this information beforehand . The aircraft members were so rude and treated me so badly with a very arrogant tone. Then I had to carry my heavy computer in my hands and they didnt offered me even a bag to transport it. I had 5 hours transit time between my flights and had to carry this laptop everywhere. They really dont care about the comfort of their passengers and just want to make extra money whenever they want. On top of that my luggage was lost and not registered on my next flight when I asked the airline to check it out. Ive been really lucky to find it at my destination but no proper follow up was possible. I will never use this airline anymore.
We chose to fly Royal Brunei business class from Melbourne to Bangkok. The first bad experience was the lounge in Melbourne the Maharajah Lounge. The food was old stale and cold. Absolutely disgusting. Having boarded the aircraft for the Melbourne to Brunei Sector and being directed to our business class seat that was the only good thing about the flight. The service was shocking . The attention to detail by the unfriendly staff was surprising for a so called business class flight. The food selection that was offered on the menu was unavailable and I had to settle for an economy meal that was inedible compared to food on other airlines that we have used The remote control on the entertainment system did not work properly. The entertainment selection was extremely poor. The staff were nowhere on seen throughout most the flight. No offer of soft drinks or refreshments. The only good thing was the legroom on the seat. The last straw was the unfriendly way that we were asked to return the menu card given to us at the start of the flight. Rude staff who should be ashamed of themselves. The 12 hour layover at Brunei airport would have been extremely difficult had it not been for the staff in the Sky Lounge who helped arrange for a temporary transit visa so that we could stay in a hotel in Brunei for a short stay. In fairness the short second sector from Brunei to Bangkok was better. The cabin staff were much more attentive and friendlier than our experience in the first sector. Overall this was a substandard Business Class Service which did not represent good value for money. Sadly I will have to endure the return trip on this disappointing airline.
Guangzhou to Cairo. It was a long haul flight with full of tourist groups the aircraft and facility were very old. 2 out of 3 PTV touch screens in my row didnt work well and you had to use the remote controller. Some cabin crew served drinks and food with one hand in the pocket and didnt look professional. There was only one choice of snacks between the meals cheese sandwich. I think the airline should improve its facility a lot.
Vancouver to Heathrow and the first and last time I will fly with British Airways. The aircraft from the stand looks impressive but soon as we boarded you could tell that the aircraft was at least 30 years old and it was so dated on the inside. My flight home was delayed yes this does happen to every airline but they allowed us to board the plane and there was an electrical fault the professionalism of BA Staff was appalling.
BA0010 World Traveller 4 Apr 2015. BangkokHeathrow London. BA0009 World Traveller 17 Apr 2015 Heathrow London Bangkok. The check in staff were unhelpful and refused to check my luggage through despite it being done on the first leg of my trip I also met others on the same flight where this was allowed. The plane was old. The Cabin crew were professional however compared to the middle eastern airlines the service wasnt nearly as good.
Singapore to Zagreb via Istanbul. Customer service at Istanbul Airport is horrible. I miss my connecting flight upon arriving in Istanbul from Singapore. I have ask the flight attendants onboard regarding my connecting flight. She assure me that I have no problem doing the connection. Upon arrival there was no staff to assist. My flight was not showing on the display. I end up going to their care point counter. The staff there is the worst. I would give the rating negative 1. They just took their time to figure out your next flight. If I have not insisted that I need to fly on the same day they just put me on the next day flight. This is the worst terminal service I come across in my 10 years of travel.
London to Bangalore via Doha. The first time I flew Qatar Business Class I was so impressed by the Q Suites that I booked three more trips however this trip was a huge disappointment Qsuite from Heathrow to Doha but no Q Suite on the Doha to Bangalore leg instead a very old fashioned seat arrangement I was in 1A which given my limited mobility made it very difficult to step over the person in 1B. The wifi was not working on either flight. On the return flights to London there was no QSuite from Doha to Gatwick and no fresh orange juice so annoying to get an inconsistent service when you are paying the same money for a ticket.
Christchurch to Nadi. Fiji Airways are awesome in customer service and I will highly recommend this airline to my friends and family. The staff was awesome in attending passengers requirements and also with the call button service.
Lima to Bogota and Viva Colombia is a low cost airline like no other that I have had the misfortune of travelling with. Taxes are not included in the ticket. You pay this at the counter in cash Dollars only. To add to insult an eticket or boarding pass on your phone is not accepted it needs to be printed. As expected the staff will refuse to help you with this. They rudely suggested we have an hour to pay them find the money or find a way to print it ourselves or not be allowed on the flight we paid for. They can print the pass for you at an extra 15. If you did not check the correct number of bags online thats an extra 15. So it comes to 30. Again as mentioned lets not forget the taxes you need to pay in cash at the counter. So that makes it 45 extra. All in all it then becomes the same price as flying on a national carrier. On the flight itself its first come first serve in terms of seating as with most low cost carriers. However being a late night flight one would expect the lights to be dimmed or turned off at some point so some people could rest a little. This was not the case at anypoint hence few were able to sleep. In terms of the Emergency exit they only allowed one person to sit next to each one. In my humble opinion that defeats the point of safety. If people are far away from the exit it takes longer to escape in the unlikely event of an emergency. In terms of Emergency at no point was their ever any briefing given by the cabin crew. I give this an overall very negative review and easily say it the lowest class of airline Ive ever travelled with.
It started with the worst check in I have ever experienced. The check in did last over 3 hours and I barely missed my flight. They told me something is wrong with my papers but they could not explain what it is just that for the airline it would be fine but the airport in Kuwait requires something. They charged me another 50 to sort things out. The flight was disappointing too despite sitting in the Premium class the seats where the most uncomfortable seats I ever sat in an airplane. I honestly thought the times of aircraft food are over. Here you get the nostalgia of survival kit like sausages and a tasteless bun with nothing more than butter the yogurt comes plain too. Staff was nice. A lot nicer that the ground staff in Mumbai. But dont expect them to walk the extra mile. Blankets on a night flight are only given by request. Than they wake you up way to early just to show you a movie how amazing Kuwait is with Ferraris and Guccis. I took my time to look through the movies which offers right about what you would expect by now. It could be worse but I would rather play on my phone and write this review. At least the flight was cheaper than most so I did not expect too much. On the other hand they even managed that I feel like I overpaid for what I got.
Worst flying experience I have had. Hand luggage was weighed prior to boarding and a lot of hand luggage was checkedin right before boarding. There was no air conditioning in the flight until 30 minutes after takeoff. Even after that the entire flight was very warm. No COVID protocol was followed on board with most passengers wearing masks under their noses and some not wearing one at all. Our checked baggage did not arrive in Kigali. Waited for 3 hours to enter the airport and collect my luggage when the next flight arrived 2 days later and missed work because of this. Never flying with RwandAir again.
My flight is HU7975 which was absolutely one of the best Ive had in years especially in consideration of the pandemic situations. Cabin crew are very warmhearted and thoughtful they came to me for at least 8 times or so to check in if i have all I need asked me if I want snacks or another meal even provided their own food when I asked for biscuits which arent part of the customer meal. Cant ask for a better experience
Cabin Crew attitude is hostile and disrespectful. Please train your crew to ask more question make less order and stop raising their voice with customer. Say thank you sorry and please is a must.
I was pleasantly surprised with the quality Of AirAsia India. In fact the cabin crew was really 5star in service especial thanks to Manthan the cabin crew purser on our flight from Pune to Jaipur on 9th March.
The flight from London to Dubai is good but not from Dubai to Colombo which is operated by flydubai. Customer service from cabin crew is very poor and is one of ignorance. Also the transport between terminals are too slow that I managed to get to the next flight last minute.
Los Angeles to Hong Kong via Shanghai. For the price this cant be beaten. I paid lass than 1900 for round trip. Business class seat thought the experience was great for the price. Im sure some would find the food a little underwhelming word of advicego for the Asian meal. There could have been more entertainment not sure how many movies they had but it wasnt extensive by any means. The seats werent the most comfortable but they werent the worst either. My main goal was to sleep most of the way and that was achieved easily. Im sure some folks would think this is poor for business class but look at the price that really is a steal so my expectations werent too high and they overdelivered. Cabin crew were reasonably friendly and although English is a 2nd language on board again it wasnt a huge problem. If I can get seats at that price again Id certainly do it
Dalaman Newcastle flight was changed 4 times between 3rd August and 10th Sept. Finally 3 days into our holiday we were voicemailed on our mobile to be informed that our flight home had been cancelled leaving us to purchase a suitable alternative. This caused enormous expense and distress. When we got to Dalaman Airport for our flight home with a different airline we found that our original flight was in fact flying. I would not recommend this airline and would never use them again. They seem very disorganised and have no customer care.
Due to the coronavirus our flight was cancelled back home. Then Condor promised us a new journey home later. And now we are stuck in Dominic Republic with no flights at all and Condor will not answer in the phone and they dont care about us at all. In mail the now tells us the will not be replacement journeys at all.
Spotless short flight with NIKI operated with a very clean and good looking plane polite crew and ontime departurearrival which is more than enough for me to be satisfied about this short hop to Vienna where I had to attend a congress. A big plus is they fly from Linate airport which is much closer to my house than Malpensa and this is why I did not fly Austrian as I usually do for this route. Their website worked well so checkingin online was very easy both ways. I will surely fly them again inside Europe.
Malaysia Airlines flight review from KL to Perth. The flight was overall alright but in terms of price paid it might be a little disappointing to be paying the price of a full service airline carrier. The most disappointing part of the whole trip is when you want to make a claim for a damaged bag. It has been 3 weeks now from the last time I lodged a report on their website portal and have yet to hear from them. No idea why their customer service is so poor postflight. It is an embarrassment for a national carrier to treat its passengers so poorly. Their neighbouring country Singapore Airlines service would bring shame to the services provided by Malaysia Airlines.
Worst airline. Dont opt for it. Airline delays by 1 hour minimum. Unprofessional and unaware staff. Advise never to opt got it and book other airlines instead.
This is by far the worst decision Ive ever made in terms of booking and I highly regret it. With COVID19 going on they had 0 sympathy in giving back credit for a flight that we didnt cancel on our own. Our only option was to change our flight and keep them as our airline. When trying to book another flight with them the only available options were for me to make it to my destination a day later than our rescheduled event my sisters wedding same for my return flight. I even tried to book flights a day early and a day later just to make up for messes up flight schedule and still had to pay a rebooking fee. A complete waste of an airline. Save your money please and book with a well known airline. Esta es con mucho la peor decision que he tomado en terminos de reserva y lamento mucho. Con COVID19 en marcha tenian 0 simpatias al devolver el credito por un vuelo que no cancelamos por nuestra cuenta. Nuestra unica opcion era cambiar nuestro vuelo y mantenerlos como nuestra aerolinea. Al intentar reservar otro vuelo con ellos las unicas opciones disponibles eran que llegara a mi destino un dia despues de nuestro evento reprogramado la boda de mi hermana lo mismo para mi vuelo de regreso. Incluso intente reservar vuelos un dia antes y un dia despues solo para compensar los horarios de vuelos desordenados y todavia tuve que pagar una tarifa de cambio de reserva. Un desperdicio completo de una aerolinea. Ahorre su dinero por favor y reserve con una aerolinea conocida.
Hoedspruit to Cape Town. Hoedspruit is a nice small airport with an indoor terrace. The flight experience was overall OK for a 2h30 flight. The real issue I had was with the booking. I received a confirmation for a wrong date then called the customer service right away and they never agreed to make a change without a 25 penalty fee. Very frustrating considering there was a problem with the booking system. Ill never book with them again.
Casablanca to Lisbon. I found this airline to be much better than expected. well cleaned aircraft friendly flight attendants. On schedule too. Very comfortable seats. They sould increase their flights to Portugal.
Philadelphia to Myrtle beach. Sat on the tarmac while pilot told us weather was bad. Flight cancelled and returned to gate. Rebooked 24 hours later. No one offered meal or hotel. Turns out it was not weather but a technical issue. Why can airlines lie and get away with it Dont fly American.
We flew from Stansted and got there early to book extra leg room. My husbands tall and requires this For three months both Thomas cook and ourselves have been trying to book extra leg room with this airline The telephone number published isnt answered and the system throws you out repeatedly just when you think you are nearly there and are about to pay for seats. Journey to Antalya was great as a result. Our return was a nightmare. Once again we got to the airport early. Paid for row one 4 seats at 20.00 per seat. Fine if thats what it takes to be comfy. We were happy. When boarding our seats were changed to row 2 but we had paid for row 1. They said sorry but these had been prebooked. This service didnt exist. As a result we waited for our refund and my husband flew in the tightest space possible. His knees were into the chair in front are the pitches aimed at five footers. He was so uncomfortable. As a result we came home with a bitterness about the holiday and the airline.
This airline doesnt even deserve a single star It is a very disappointing and unprofessional airline We booked our tickets3 of us from Puerto Princessa to Coron on Jan 2 2018 and had everything paid from accommodations to our activities in both cities. But airjuan totally wrecked our vacation They cancelled our flight due to the technical issue as they said in a peak season. Our nightmare in this company didnt end there. They have given us the option to refund our money and give us a flight credit. They told us that the processing will take 2025 days but it is already on the 32nd day today yet we havent receive any words from them. We sent emails for an update but no one from their team replies.
Ryanair provided a very punctual reliable service. Follow the rules and there are no problems Friendly crew. My only concern was the steep stairs down to the boarding area at Stansted airport and no help for the elderly passengers.
LHRYYZ in business was looking forward to a B787 but this flight was a B777. Had the rear facing seat comfortable enough but it is always awkward trying to clamber over the passenger seated diagonally opposite. Enjoyed the plentiful supply of pink champagne. Lunch was fine as was the afternoon tea. IFE screen on the small side but managed one movie. Crew were pleasant friendly and efficient.
A rather good flight overall. Good and very comfortable spacious hard product despite the old 222 cabin layout in Business on time with good information and a very active and friendly cabin crew except for the interaction Ill describe further. Korean Air Ground staff in CDG were very good and managed to help me join my reservation with a connecting KE flight under a different reservation and tag my luggage directly to the final destination which saved me a lot of time and hassle in ICN. Onboard pillows are quite small and not that comfortable for a fullflat bed in Business Class similar to what you would find in Premium Economy on some other airlines. Catering could also be improved KE always has very good food on long haul flights in economy class but I feel the upside between business and economy is not up to what you find on other Skyteam members. The big surprise came a little later down the flight when I was taking pictures of the economy cabin from the rear of the lower deck. A cabin crew came rushing out of nowhere and started asking me whether I took pictures to which I replied yes of course is that a problem. Without further explanation she requested to see the pictures I had taken with my cellphone I didnt know people can actually ask for that which I did while asking what the issue was no reply. After a few seconds she said ah its OK and left. No further explanation no apologies for the rude or stressed out tone of voice.. The cabin manager came during that time and was standing nearby not saying anything and just left without saying a word. Ive been flying countless times for over 10 years with Korean Air and have never experienced any such situation. This just felt really rude and a bit strange that the staff couldnt just have a polite and simple discussion with me to explain what the issue was.
Due to the Covid 19 I had to cancel a flight to Nairobi. The cancellation was done on time early march. Well Kenya Airways refuses to refund my ticket and proposes a voucher to be used in the next twelve months. On top of that no one responded to my email for over a month. I really believe that this is not acceptable.
This airline is supposedly low cost but beware youll pay more than a regular airline. They allow one bag and count each item backpack suitcase separately so make sure you pay for the extra bag on booking or theyll charge an exorbitant 100 Canadian for extra bags. Very unhelpful staff not GBA staff so just rule followers and an extraordinary amount of time to check in. Charged our extra bags in HK dollars but wouldnt take HK dollars at Taipei airport and hard to find where you have to pay. Once on board they try to upsell you to seats in the first 3 rows or the exit row. Snacks are expensive. You do get a small bottle of free water. My conclusion is that supposed low cost airlines are a scam and would stick with the majors.
ZRHSOF. No delays quite interesting flight magazine charming attendants. Overall really pleasant 2 hours flight.
Melbourne to London via Bandar Seri Begawan. The plane was elegant the cabin crew very professional and made a long flight more pleasant. The food was great. I have to say that Royal Brunei is my favorite airline. The planes are new Brunei airport is fairly small and easy to get around and to check in or transit while the ground staff is polite. The inflight entertainment is very good but there are spaces for improvement. Toilets and planes are the cleanest.
I took a first class ticket Dubai to Kuwait but overall I was disappointed with the experience. First my chauffeur driver never informed the hotel that he was waiting for me outside as I instructed EK to do so via my telephone conversation in Dubai. I had no idea he was waiting for me outside. The first class checkin experience was not as tremendous as I anticipated. Basically there was attention given to me but I never felt like a first class passenger. They let me checkin in the express checkin counter as opposed to the first class counter. The food and service provided in the first class lounge in concourse A is unacceptable. Not only was the food tasteless but it takes a very long time to prepare something for me from a la carte menu. For example it took approximately 10 15 minutes to provide me my club sandwich and 15 20 minutes to provide me the um ali sweet. All this while the lounge was empty. While I was waiting for my food the waiter asked me what I wanted to drink and I told him water he kept goofing around and I chased him until he gave me my water. This is unacceptable for first class service. During boarding business class passengers entered door 1A with us as opposed to door 2A thus ruining the exclusive experience of first class. Upon disembark business class passengers were trying to skip queue and leave the aircraft before first class passengers do. I will not be flying Emirates first class again and will look for alternatives such as Qatar Airways.
I had the worst experience ever had in my travel history with Turkish Airlines. The airline emailed me a day before to tell my flight was cancelled. Right after I received an email I called the customer service to verify my flight. But the customer service representative keep telling me my flight is not cancelled and scheduled on time for next 12 hours. 12 hours before my flight the customer service representative after hours of time spent in phone calls told my flight was cancelled and I am compelled to buy another expensive ticket from Qatar Airways. And Turkish airlines do not pay for my ticket value. This is the worst ever airline I have ever flew among all international flights I flew. Never recommend anyone to fly with Turkish Airlines.
BA First Class is not even that any more. Starting with the lounge in T3 this may be an offshoot of the fine Concorde Room in T5 but it need not feel like a rural train station. Poor food average drinks and an indifferent staff do not compare with LH facilities in FRA or MUC. There is no ground assistance and boarding was haphazard. Fine Cornish champagne was offered and happily quaffed. The seat was OK but not in the same class as the new AC J class pods and not close to the Emirates suites. Small things like the menu presentation boarding sufficient food there are a lot of seats in F seat comfort OK but nothing special and the toilets small and curiously offering singleply paper. The crew were very friendly the service was decent in delivery but poor overall. BA your relentless drive to the bottom is catching up with you and your First Class product is not worth the name anymore. One can only assume that BA are trying to phase it out as they drive any paying passengers to other airlines who place a serious effort to deliver a superb premium product. And no wifi
I booked a round trip flight for me and my wife from Aruba to Curacao leaving on 11162018 and returning on 11212018. I received an email from them yesterday stating that the return flight had been canceled and they booked me on a flight almost 7 hours later. This would make me miss my connection to United cost me 300.00 per person to change the flight to a flight the following day and cost me an overnight stay in Aruba. Around 900.00 total. I called their customer service line and they told me that I could get a full refund by emailing email protected. I sent the email and they replied and said they could not refund the ticket cost even though this violates article 10.2 of the carriage agreement. After several emails back and forth I contacted my credit card company provided them all the emails and they agreed to reverse the charge. They also told me there have been numerous complaints to Visa and MasterCard about this company. I also researched it a bit and the company is in bankruptcy and only has 3 planes in their entire fleet. If you have already been screwed by this company just file a claim with your credit card provider.
Flew from Doha to London Heathrow. Qatar Airways Business Class on the A380 is one of the best I have been on. The seat is spacious with plenty of storage. The menu had a very good choice of main meals and also something vegetarian. The bar at the back of Business Class has an airy feel to it. I travelled with my husband and we decided to have the two seats in the middle. He is a terrible traveller but he managed to sleep for 5 hours and felt very refreshed when we got to London. We had a 4hour layover in Doha and their Business Class lounge is also very good which makes the long flight with stopover much more pleasurable.
I was scheduled to fly BA208 from Miami to London on January 18th. Boarding and departure went normal but than close to takeoff the ordeal began. Captain announced a technical problem at approx. 0915 pm and thats when the horror started. Overall we ended up sitting in the plane until 0100 am before we were finally allowed to leave the plane any attempts to fix the fault failed. We were given accomodation but that was a 45 mins drive from Miami Airport. Checkin took another 30 mins due to a long queue of stranded passengers and the place was like a freezer. Was rebooked for a flight the next day but downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy. Old tatty 747 very uncomfortable seat and entertainment screen was the size a mobile phone. Worst of all the delay of one day has forced me to add another night in London and cancel my connection to Munich. Total additional expenses not counting the difference between Premium Economy which I paid for and Economy was 500. Including the gap between Economy and Premium Economy probably 900. Now this is where a service oriented company would have an opportunity to make a difference. Submitted my compensation claims incl. proof for the above expenses as per protocol online no confirmation. Followed up with a call had to wait approx. 45 mins to talk to a human and was told that most expenses are not refundable but I would be compensated for the remaining. No further confirmation email etc. Was paid a mere 50 into my account with no explanation what this is supposed to be for the expenses were 900. Decided to do some research and it appears that under EU law airlines are required to compensate for consequential damages if the delay if more than 3 hours my delay was 21 hours. Absolutely atrocious customer service lousy product. How on earth BA deserves 4 stars in beyond me.
Operated on behalf of Lufthansa this Munich to Geneva route seems to get passed around LHs subsidiaries Ive flown with Augsburg Airways Lufthansa Cityline and the parent company but this was the best one Id flown. Friendly quadrilingual Air Dolomiti crew even Swiss crews usually only manage 23 languages nice snack box with and good alcoholic and soft drinks. The interior was very clean seemed pretty new and I quite like the colour scheme. The seat pitch gave me enough space to work on my laptop which I dont take as a given any more. All on time I hope I get them next time I do this route.
Final leg of journey from Athens to SFO My wife had a broken foot and was treated poorly by ground and cabin staff. The ground crew could not figure out how to get her on board since she could not walk. Eventually a cabin wheel chair showed up however this delayed the flight. She could not travel in the extra leg room seat which we had purchased due to regulations definitely understandable. However no reasonable effort was made to find a nonemergency bulk head seat by switching passengers to her lost seat emergency row. We flew Turkish before Covid and had decent service. They level of service and attitude especially male flight attendants and ticketing agents is troubling and highly disappointing. Eventually they will lose regardless of price point to poor service.
I flew in Economy Class from Zurich to Male on 16th of May and back on 24th of May 2015. I have to say I am very impressed by the service provided. Cabin staff were very dedicated it was the same staff on both flights as they were also staying in the Maldives for a week. The night flight on the outward leg was only half full which made a quick Service possible and I could sleep in an empty middle row. Very good meals real cutlery and a real glass frequent drinks and the alcoholic beverages for which you have to pay are of good quality and moderate in price. I also liked the Movenpick icecream provided in midflight on the return flight a day flight. The inflight entertainment is a very good product with an uptodate movie selection. But the major bonus has been the consistent friendliness of the entire crew. I felt a strong sense for hospitality among the staff and would definitely fly with them again if the schedule suits me.
Melbourne to Bangkok via Taipei return. All 4 flights were nothing short of exemplary operated by an A350 which is much quieter and noticeably reduces jet lag. The crew on all my flights were friendly professional and very safety conscious. Meal service was prompt and with a smile and the crew were polite and friendly. I ordered several drinks and requested a toothbrush and an adapter and all were delivered quickly. They passed out hot towels for economy class passengers which is a muchappreciated gesture. During the overnight flight staff often passed through the cabin with water and juice and kept the toilets clean. My flight back to Melbourne was delayed by 8 hours and we were provided accommodation at the Novotel near Taipei airport and they organised a shuttle bus to take us back to the airport in the morning I found the ground staff at Taipei airport to be friendly and customer focused. The onboard entertainment system is easy to navigate and had many new releases and TV shows to choose from. The only aspect that could be improved is their food options I found most of my meals to be lacking flavor however they did offer an ice cream bar and a bread roll with all meals. Staff offer a selection of juice soft drinks wine and coffeeChinese tea with the meal service. I would not hesitate to fly with them again in fact I found their service to be superior to Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines and would recommend China Airlines without hesitation.
Bangkok to Tokyo. Ive flown many low cost airlines before but they still served meals offered beverages and just had more general information. The flight attendants were there for no reason because they dont even go down the aisle once even for water. Theres less than ten movies to choose from for a 8 hr flight. The customer service is absolutely terrible not even a phone number on their website and they never got back to any emails. On our way home from Thailand we were denied boarding because they couldnt complete the transfer due to the check in counter because outside the terminal in Japan. We couldnt make our flight and had to buy another flight with a completely different airline. Lost over 1000 due to this discrepancy and inability to transfer in Japan and misinformation.
Flew British Airways from Saint Lucia to London Gatwick. Agree with other recent reviews BA quality is severely lacking compared to other Oneworld carriers business class. We were not addressed by name. Staff seemed rushed and not proactive at all had to ask for anything we required. Not all breakfast items were available. Seat space and comfort seriously under par. Nobody came to collect rubbish prior to landing so it remained on the floor in front of me. Did not feel like valued customers.
I paid extra for all my four flights on COPA to have the Exit row seat 17A for the extra legroom. At Panama airport upon boarding March 1st to Toronto the ticket agent ran after me and gave me a different boarding pass putting me into an awkward painful middle seat 7B which is not in my listed preferences. No amount of pleading with the staff would change anything. I questioned the man sitting in my 17A seat and he said that he also paid for that seat online. So obviously I was unceremoniously bumped due to double booking by COPA. Such practices should be illegal. The problems they cause do not help the airlines reputation Then my backpack could not be stowed because all the overhead bins were full and it ended up being thrown in cargo and sent on the conveyors to Carousel 12 at YYZ and it was damaged as well. I was absolutely livid at such cavalier abuse of an old man. I completed a postflight survey with my complaint but have received no satisfactory response to date. I am a 220 lb 72 yearold greatgrandfather who endured an awful painful flight for 6 hours in a middle seat at the hands of COPA. I have since been in touch with COPA Customer Service thats a joke who refunded me 26.25 and offered a 50 travel voucher only good for one year. As if I would ever fly with them again if there were other alternatives.
Dublin to Manila via Istanbul. This flight was both a disaster and a nightmare. This incident happened during IstanbulManila leg of my flight. Im not sure what happened but I your ground crew was disorderly and very unwelcoming. The boarding was horrible flying business is not worth it especially I am queueing with the rest of the passengers. The on board experience was the tipping point. Since last year I never had problem with my Vegan meal onboard as I make sure to preselect them online. But this flight was a disaster. Not only I made only preselection I wrote to the menu that I am vegan and the chef was aware i dont eat cheese as he asked me before flight. When I was served with appetizers I was curious as they gave me a butter on a small dish. At first I though it could be vegan as I was given butter previously but that was on a pack not this time. I called the head steward and explain my conundrum. The chef came and explained and apologized. They insisted i ordered vegetarian as shown on their records but I showed my confirmation email that I did preselect Vegan meal. Somewhere something went wrong. I settled for orange juice and went to sleep. Before landing the chef gave me a minimal but unbusiness like food. I still appreciate his effort to come up with vegan food.
One of the most horrible experiences ever. We bought our tickets from Baltimore to Reykjavik in November picked the seats bought carryon paid for priority boarding etc. we received our confirmation and we went on with our lives. In February I checked our reservation and just on a whim checked the plane and looked at our seats. Turned out they changed the plane and instead of moving our seats they left them. I had to contact play via Facebook messenger they have no telephones and asked about the seats. They first answered we had 36e and 36f and 20a and 20b. I had to tell them that 36f and 20a did not exist. They said we can move your seats. So we ended up getting separated. That was problem 1. Problem 2 most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. We had bought the XL leg room. So so so uncomfortable. There are no power charging plugs for the phone. No wifi. No entertainment. The cabin lights are always on so dont expect to sleep. Everything is a fee even water. Loading In Reykjavik was a pleasure they put everyone on a bus priority boarding and regular boarding drop you off in front of the plane and make you carry up the baggage with you. All in a single mass. Older and feeble people struggled and had to get help from other passengers because there was not a single Play employee helping all while dealing with 20 degree temperatures with winds. Good times. I will never fly Play again.
The Hong Kong Tapei is Cathays busiest route and no surprise that the incabin service is nice. However the ground crew at gate and transfer desk are not that passionate and proactive on helping passengers perhaps its a morning flight. The aircraft is a brand new A350.
Tokyo Narita to Singapore. A very comfortable flight with very attentive flight attendants who were friendly and not intrusive. Put on a genuine smile. Meal was superb. Had fried chicken on steam rice with good sides as well. Tasty but not oily. Kabosu which is the airlines own drink creation of lime and honey is really good and refreshing. The leg room seemed more generous than I have seen on other airlines. Highly recommend ANA if you are flying to Japan. Excellent service and products.
Flew London Heathrow to Male via Doha. I went to the Maldives on my honeymoon and flying with Qatar Airways felt like a honeymoon of its own. The plane comfort is unbelievable the staff were helpful and always had a smile. The food was surprisingly good and tasty. There was a variety of TV series and movies available. I wasnt able to connect to the WiFi unfortunately but honestly I didnt really need it.
Taipei via Istanbul to Bremen with Turkish Airlines. It was probably the worst flight experience I had. The flight was supposed to leave late at night and the staff kept delaying it due to a technical reason in half an hour steps until about 4 am 6 hours late. I talked to a woman who flew the same route to Bremen and got upgraded to business class. Due to the delay I missed my connection in Istanbul and had to deal with the rudest customer service who wanted to give me a flight the next day which was already my birthday that I tried to get home for in time after lining up with several other passengers even though the airline knew for 15 hours that I would not be able to make my connecting flight. Only after arguing and looking up different options myself they booked me on a different flight to Bremen via Frankfurt. The rest of the waiting time in Istanbul i just felt terrible because no one should be mistreated by such customer service after the airline messed up on several ends already. But it gets worse After finally arriving at Bremen airport with a total delay of 10 hours the airline confirmed that their customer service can be even worse. I wrote a feedback about my whole trip and how bad their staff handled the situation and asked why some passengers get a business class upgrade and some dont. I also applied to the passenger rights posted on their website where in my case they offered 600 compensation. I cannot tell the emails in detail but it went on for 3 months and they just kept trying to find excuses. First of all they claimed that the delay has been beyond their control. At the gate it said the delay was due to technical reason I even sent a picture as proof which is not beyond an airlines control. About the rude customer service and delay policy they didnt really say anything besides offering to pay for my coffee in Istanbul. This confirmed to me that they just dont care about their customers. And finally they said there has been no passenger upgraded on the flight. These are just some parts of the argument I had with Turkish airlines over the last three months. They dont stick to their promises and they have no interest in providing you a good travel experience. They dont even stick to their compensation policy posted on their website. Things can go wrong thats just how it is. But how Turkish Airlines handles a situation like this really shows what you get with this airline. I thought never again but had one more flight with them from Bremen to Cairo via Istanbul in April. The flight got cancelled after boarding the plane and I arrived in Istanbul 9 hours late. Then planned sightseeing tour couldnt be done anymore and the hotel was booked for nothing. As I already expected I had to deal with Turkish Airlines ground staff in Istanbul again. Worst airline I have ever taken
Quito to Manta. My Wife and I were going to go from Florida to Quito on another airline and we booked our flights with Tame from Quito to Manta and back to Quito. We had something happen in our personal lives and had to cancel our trip. The biggest issue we had was with Tame. The tickets are 100 nonrefundable and you cant get any credit. We are having an emergency right now and were just looking to reschedule our trip another time when we can sit and think about planning the dates. Since we cant get a credit were forced to pay a fee 30 per person and also immediately choose other dates NOW which as I said is not convenient for us at the moment. The only other option is to just lose all the money we paid. They told us we can choose the new dates up to one year after our original flight dates. We settled on dates in June 2020 and called back to reschedule. Then they told us we only have until the date of PURCHASE May 15th not the date of our original flight. So we had to hang up and rethink all the dates again. We called back again then they said the system wont let us fly that week we have to fly before May 5th. We dont want to fly at that time so we call again later after we picked new dates for the third time in Nov 2019. We call back to reschedule to Nov and now they say we have to pay an additional 110 in addition to the 250 that we already paid for the first flight. We are looking online and the ticket prices are cheaper than what we originally paid so why are we having to pay extra on top of the 30 per person fees They cant explain it. So were being forced to pick dates NOW which we are not really ready to do to pick dates we dont want because they just wont allow us to fly next June and pay 360 total for these dates. We decided to just lose everything we paid and learn the lesson to never fly with Tame. Were going to pick the dates we wanted in June 2020 and pay full price with Copa or Avianca instead of dealing with Tame anymore. We also will be be letting all our family still living in Ecuador of our issues with Tame. We fly our parents from Manta to Florida several times a year for the last 5 years so I hope they enjoy the 250 they got from us because that is the last.
It is the second time emirates cancel my flight 2 days before departure. The 2nd time that I paid a hotel booking as well as train tickets that I wont use. I also paid PCR test as we are required to have one 72h before flying and then they cancel the flight. They even tell us no compensation because its not their fault. Horrible service.
We arrived over 2 hours before our flight was to depart from Dublin to Philadelphia and checked with ticket assistance when we saw a line in ticketing that was very long. The ticketing assistant told us to get in line. No mention of 75 minute flight closing time or that we should go to a special flight closing counter if the 75 minutes was close to expiring before we got to ticketing counter. We get to ticketing counter and they tell us flight closed too late. Then when we go back to ticketing assistance counter they blame us for not listening to the announcement that the Philadelphia flight was closing. We never heard such and announcement and asked the ticketing assistant why they did not tell us about all of this when we initially approached them and questioned them. They continued to blame us. Very poorly managed airline based on my experience and the attitude of the employees who dealt with us was not a reflection of poor management.
New York JFK to Quito. My grandson and I upgraded at JFK to business class for 200 per person. We got next to nothing for the extra money. The seats were very comfortable and the cabin spacious. But service was almost nonexistent. We were served the same breakfast as in coach in the same plastic containers with the same plastic utensils. And that was it there was no follow up service with coffee juice etc let alone alcohol. There was also no inflight entertainment. Our bags were tagged as priority but were almost the last on the carousel at Quito
Just completed a return trip to Hong Kong on the A380 which is a magnificent aircraft. The crew food and inflight entertainment were good. We travelled economy and paid an extra 140 to reserve 2 seats on the upper deck. We found the seats uncomfortable and when the person in front reclined their seat you were trapped. Leg room was restricted by the video box. We were sat 2 rows from the toilet which were nearly constantly in use and the noise from the toilet flush was an irritating. The inflight entertainment just kept me sane as I found it impossible to be comfortable.
Harbin to Seattle via Taipei. Absolutely brilliant customer service from check in at Harbin when they were having system difficulties to arriving very late in Taipei and not just getting me onto my connecting flight with NO minutes to spare but ensuring my suitcase also made it. Ground staff in all 3 locations were fantastic and I am so grateful. Thank you for getting me and my luggage home after a very tiring work trip.
Flew Eurotraveller Heathrow to Athens and back. Both flights only slightly delayed in departing crew attentive on both sectors and being a band 4 flight hot meals provided although edible the meat on the Athens to Heathrow was indeterminable. Cabin was fairly clean on both flights however did find a boarding card from 24 hours previous in my seat pocket. Traveled with a 6 month old baby and at Heathrow and on board was looked after my only criticism which is not really BAs fault was the check in agent at Athens swissport was hesitant about letting our pushchair through to the gate despite my insistence this had come from London with us and hadnt been an issue then
Saint Petersburg to Samara. The airline is very good. The cabin is clean and comfortable and with this always promised food and friendly staff. As for the baggage allowance things are even better the baggage allowance is 30 kilograms.
BRESTR. Normal LCC. Staff friendly prices on board ok plane clean. Travelled with hand luggage only which was not weighed.
It was the first time flying on the A380 and for the first time in my life slept for about nine hours on the flight from Heathrow to Singapore. After reading reviews suggesting that the seats in World Traveller were small and uncomfortable I was not looking forward to this long haul flight. All I can say is these seats are the most comfortable I have ever sat slept on. The cabin was quiet with excellent cabin crew. My only complaint is you have to know how to work the system to get the seats with extra legroom or upstairs
Paris to StDenis Reunion in Business Class. Seat is comfortable food is perfect and staff very friendly. In StDenis lounge we got champagne and apetizers vry nice. Compared to Air France this company is excellent
Worst airline in Vietnam. They delayed the flight without any notice for 2.5 hours which one can find only in the airport after checkin. More of that they knew that didnt will be delayed because they delayed all their flight that day but still didnt notify passengers. No water no food nothing to apologize. Moreover they started boarding when it should be the departure time.
Melbourne to Taipei via Kuala Lumpur. The worst online chat that I have used. I have an AirAsia X voucher that was automatically given to me even though I wanted a full refund. When I finally went ahead to book a D7 flight as per the terms and conditions my voucher code did not work. I read through the whole TC and deduced that it should work. Staff could not offer any alternative and kept asking me to refer back to the terms and conditions or alter the flight dateroute. The problem is not the flight it is the voucher. He did not seem to get it. I used to love this airline but not anymore.
Terrible experience flying out of Gatwick an hour to check in for Premium. Total chaos calling forward customers whose flights were about to depart even for Premium. An hour in line just for document check as we werent checking any bags They need proper online check in No comparison to the airport experience that Virgin provides at Heathrow. Onboard in Premium is fine but I wont fly with them again just because of the high stress airport experience. It also reminds me never to fly out of Gatwick. Norse also do not support TSA precheckKTN for departing USA. A real pain all around. I wont fly with Norse again.
Worst airline. Flight time was altered via text message a total of 5 times in 4 hours. Ended up being delayed just under 2 hours surprise No compensation if under 2 hours of course Requested a pre boarding ticket on check in due to cardiac condition and was not issued the proper designation until we got to the Gate and denied early boarding. Staff was rude and unsympathetic
Phuket to Amsterdam via Moscow. I had chosen a day flight with a 1H20 connection in Moscow. But after online checkin i noticed the scheduled departure time had changed which eventually lead to a 14 hour delay. Ticket was booked 5 months in advance. Even as member of their frequent flyer program I wasnt notified and there was no way for me knowing of this change until it was to late.
Mexico City to Paris. Rude staff and the food quality was terrible for me. Flight without wifi despite advertising that this service was provided. It was extremely cold and no alcohol apart from wine and beer. Departure from Paris with 90 minutes delay and I had to travel away from my partner due to their rules to make people pay even more. At the return I forgot my phone in the toilet of the airport of Cancun and realised that I missed it when I was already in the aircraft but still on the ground waiting for the departure. I asked the staff to let me go quickly and come back as people was still boarding the plane and they said no and added that as it was Mexico I could forget my phone and declare my loss when I will arrive in Paris. As it turned out my phone was found and returned to my home address.
Tel Aviv to Amman. We had a short flight to connect to Amman to connect to Heathrow to connect to LAX to Fly home. Food was not an issue but there was smoking on the plane. Stewardess spent the entire time on her cell phone texting even when announcement had been made to put electronics away. She never once looked up for her phone.
This airline absolutely sucks with regards to operational practices. Youd think air travel was a new discovery in Mexico as no one seems to know what theyre doing or even what their co workers are doing. Then just wait til they lose your luggage 2 bags like they did for us. On a flight from Guadalajara to Vegas we had to switch to another Viva flight by waking a 14 mile outdoors at the Monterrey MX Airport. I like exercise but cmon. We asked two staff about baggage and were assured it would be transfered. After over a dozen calls most because they left my wife on hold then hung up on her she was told one bag was found in Monterrey. Initially they said theyd get it to Sacramento then that story changed and Las Vegas would be the best they could do. Best advise as someone whose flown to Mexico a few times is dont be cheap buy a roundtrip ticket with a major airline preferably a direct flight.
Houston to Munich via Istanbul. Do not fly with Turkish Airlines especially if you fly coach. The online booking system failed repeatedly from the day I booked three seats from Houston to Germany via Istanbul. I booked 8 months in advance. The flight times changed three times no more than 10 minutes on any leg. I learned that if you have reserved seats and dont call the airline to say you agree with the changes your seats are not reserved anymore. I was able to reserve three bulkhead seats for the 12 hour leg but found that our seats were given to a family with a baby and we were moved to the row behind them which would have been fine except that my son who is 511 tall could not sit with his knees facing forward because the seats were too close together. When the seats were in the recline position my daughter who is 54 tall could not put her legs in the forward position On our return trip I tried for two days to reserve and pay over 210 for exit row seats and the Turkish Airlines web site could not process the payment. I tried this option using the iphone app and got farther along in the process but it ultimately failed as well. Each time the process failed I would log out then log back in and my account would show that our seats were reserved but not I did not receive a confirmation and there were no pending charges on my credit card. After a few hours I finally decided to call the Turkish Airlines desk in Houston but because of the time difference it was closed on Sunday and would be closed on Memorial Day Monday. I then called the Turkish Airlines phone number 90 212 444 08 492 and the customer service rep stated that two of the seats in exit row were reserved but were not paid for and she suggested I pay for them online. I explained I was unable to pay for them online and wanted to pay for them through her. She explained that in order for her to do that she would have to release the seats and they might get reserved by someone else. Since that was the only way I could pay for the seats I approved releasing the seats and within seconds the representative said the seats were gone. She did rebook us in three seats together but the thought of sitting in those horribly cramped seats is something all three of us are I gave a 1 point overall rating because this page required a rating. Otherwise I would have not have given any points
I flew from Cape Town to Dubai via Ethiopia. The Dubai government website states a PCR test can be completed on arrival in Dubai. When I checked in at Cape Town airport Ethiopian airport staff did not request a covid test to board my first leg to Ethiopia. However I was denied boarding in Ethiopia as they informed me a PCR was required. I was forced to spend 2 days in Ethiopia waiting for a PCR test which was costly. I understand requirements need to be met but Im deeply dissatisfied that the PCR wasnt requested to board in Cape Town as the airline were well aware of my entire journey and end destination. When I raised the matter with the airline their only response was that it was mentioned on their website.
We were late leaving Barcelona to France but we were not asked if we had a connection other customers were and moved so they could get off first. They only had about 6 officers in passport control out of around 300 people waiting. Boarding the bus to the terminal for our connecting flight the bus stopped and waited there was no one. We missed our flight and no one would even help us we were led in a mouse maze where the employees were rude and wouldnt give us a hotel. I will never recommend Air France to anyone.
I recently had the pleasure of flying with China Southern Airlines and I am compelled to share my exceptional experience. The level of service I received was truly unparalleled. From the moment I checked in I was greeted with genuine warmth and hospitality by the airline staff. Their professionalism and attention to detail were noticeable and very much appreciated. The inflight service was remarkable as well. The cabin crew was attentive responsive and consistently ensured that my needs and comfort were their top priority. The flight attendants were incredibly friendly and patient answering questions and fulfilling requests with grace and a smile. I was particularly impressed by their dedication and commitment to customer service. The seating was comfortable and spacious making the long journey much more bearable. The meals were delicious and the entertainment options available were diverse and enjoyable adding to the overall positive experience of the flight. Moreover the punctuality of China Southern Airlines was impressive. Both my flights departed and arrived exactly on schedule which is a testament to their operational efficiency. I have flown with many airlines but the service provided by China Southern Airlines truly stands out. I would highly recommend China Southern Airlines. This airline clearly values customer satisfaction and it shows in their service.
BangkokSingapore flight delayed by one hour without any information or explanation from ground staff or the crew. Boarding messy and disorganised with no respected priorities. Aircraft cramped and dirty despite being a brand new A321 Neo. Very loud music played during most of the flight for no reason. No safety presentation was performed by the crew. Wifi advertised but dysfunctional during the whole flight. A meal is offered for passengers connecting on Singapore Airlines flights but it was inedible and the crew never came to collect them until just before landing. How this airline can be part of the Singapore Airlines group is a real mystery.
I had booked individual tickets for my wife and myself to fly via GoAir direct flight Bangalore to Jaipur. The flight date was 7th Feb and GoAir decided to cancel the flight on 1st Feb. They refunded the amount because they didnt have any other options to fly in the sector. We later realized they did not have any operational reasons beyond their control as stated in their system generated inconvenience regretted message. They had just reassigned the flight to Bangalore to Lucknow sector. We had to book tickets on Indigo at the last minute for more than double the amount we had initially paid. And this is not the first time I have seen such stuff happen. They do this more often than you would think. The entire process was a mental harassment. Never flying this airline again. That is for sure.
Flew Air Seychelles from SEZ to BOM. Purchased an upgrade at the lounge in Mahe Airport handled in a professional manner. Seat comfort ok for 4hr 30min flight. Entertainment was Etihad ebox so there was plenty of choice. Dinner served was excellent fish roulade chicken curry. South African sauvignon blanc was good. Friendly efficient crew. wifi and sms available. On time arrival into Mumbai.
Gatwick to Perth return via Dubai. Excellent level of service. Modern comfortable clean aircraft. Approachable smiling cabin crew. High ratio to passengers in first class cabin. Lounge facilities in Dubai excellent. Only one question which applies to most airlines Why do they allow infants in premium cabins. A 7 hour flight of having a non stop screaming baby is just not on.
Miami to London Heathrow. As with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with BAs customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline. My issue was with faulty equipment onboard. Issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy. Had to move seat and as first club and premium economy all full had to move back to economy. Asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation. Following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear BA lacks consistency and dont wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong. As i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think BA now need to work on their problem solving skills. I now have 91000 Avios going to waste as my business will be going else where.
I add this old comment out of interest to others. LHR to Sao Paulo Sao P to Salvador. Just a few minutes before scheduled take off flight delayed by 14 hours gone tech. I risked loosing my sailing holiday. The TAM functionaire accompanied and assisted me to get my baggage off the plane and spent a lot of time and effort trying to help me. I say she went well beyond the call of duty This flight was delayed not by a fault of TAM but of BA who stole their slot Arriving at SP they tried to organise hotels for all the passengers. Returning to LHR plane half empty we all got to stretch out great sleep the first and last time that will happen All in all warmly recommend TAM it is important to know the actual cause of the problem. This is nearly always gross overcrowding both on the ground and in the air.
MNLPOMRAB return in Business. In the last five years flying with Air Niugini service and airplane quality has deteriorated dramatically. A flight inside PNG has become an absolute lottery game without help whatsoever from the ground crew.
My family has been flying Cathay for a long time on trans continental and other long haul flights. Having flown ANA JAL and other Asian airlines we decided to give Cathays business class product a try as we had heard good things about them. Our first impression from the onset was lack of hospitality from the check in counters which gradually got worse as we boarded. The onboard FAs never welcomed us properly didnt ask for our coats to be hung. The Flight manager came once introducing herself and we never saw her again. The crew were just pacing up and down the aisle and never once smiled. They continued with one of the worst meal offerings. The meals on a set menu werent dine anytime options they were pre packaged and felt the same offerings were being presented to economy class passengers. The bread tasted like it was transported from 4 flights before. It wasnt surprising to see how much Cathay had declined in the reviews. Currently they sit at the bottom among 10 best airlines in some websites and much lower in others. Its sad to see that a premier airlines cant get the basics right. Perhaps the can take a leaf from ANA and Singapore airlines hospitality. We flew Singapore economy on short haul flights and their service was next to superb with so much attention to details in economy The positives at Cathay were their beds and on board IFE. The beds were very comfy with the duvets and offered good privacy. However the cabin cleanliness wasnt great. The 777 aircraft was tired looking. The Pier lounge at HKG was great at first impression especially their tea and bar offerings. However the lounge fell completely flat in food options. ANA and JAL lounges in Japan are absolutely amazing compared to Cathays. I still believe in the airlines but I wont be flying unless I have experienced from other travellers that they have indeed improved their lacklustre service and food offerings.
I was elated to see Breeze flying nonstop to Hartford from RDU I would no longer have to connect through a major hub to get there. And it was cheaper than when I flew SWA there last year. The 2x weekly schedule is hard to schedule a trip around but since I was going to 90s Con the dates worked out. The check in crew is friendly enough and the flight attendants ok. And for people who bought the Nicer tier should get a free snack and a drink BTW not just a cup of water. The seating in the Embraer aircraft even in the Nicer section is tight like an AA regional jet. Economy seating on a Delta mainline is roomier I got to my destination and back home safe and reasonably on time. Breeze could use some improvement but theyre doing something right because inbound to BDL was almost full and outbound to RDU was completely full.
The management is not at all good. Seat assignment is always messed up. They made me wait till the last minute for the seat assignment. Also they kept switching gates which was very confusing
Very good first experience with Volotea and we are delighted we were very surprised by the professionalism and the quality of the reception before and during the flight have to say it was perfect
EgyptAir is the worst airline I have experienced. I had a flight from Luxor to Alexandria via Cairo. I showed the attendant my boarding passes while checking in my bags. He told me that the boarding passes were no longer relevant because the flight changed. Without any explanation of what actually changed. Then he gave me boarding passes to Cairo only and marked my luggage to arrive in Cairo. I stopped him and tried to explain that Im going to Alexandria. He corrected me and said that Im mistaken. That my flight was only to Cairo. I explained that I have proof I have two legs on EgyptAir from Luxor to Cairo and then from Cairo to Luxor. He insisted that I was wrong despite the ticket I presented. Then another attendant started searching for my ticket at the next counter over after seeing how frustrated I was. New information emerged. My flight from Cairo to Alexandria was apparently canceled and I had supposedly received an email. No email was received. The attendant then proceeded to explain that I needed to stop in Cairo pick up my luggage and then file a complaint. No attempt to book me on an alternative flight was made or secure accommodations for me. Ill be landing at night around 9pm. I dont live in Cairo and dont have a hotel reservation there. I asked to speak to a manager and the first attendant ridiculed me by saying hes the manager and that there is nothing further to discuss. Just like those comedy shows where everyone is the manager. I picked up my boarding pass to Cairo and walked away. I felt humiliated. I felt disgusted by the staff at EgyptAir.
Melbourne to Sofia via Doha. Our holiday actually involved 4 flights with Qatar Airways and all were excellent. The takeoffs landings and flights were all smooth and ran on time. Boarding procedures were efficient as was disembarkation. Staff were well trained and friendly never getting impatient with passenger demands particularly as they had to work hard with so many passengers on board. The amenities were always clean. I was really impressed and appreciative of the care and attention I was given by staff particularly Prue as I blacked out and landed on the floor in the galley area. She instilled confidence in me with her calm friendly demeanor and provided oxygen for me. Prue also kept check on me and provided food and a regular supply of water through out the remainder of the flight. I was further impressed when I was again checked by the staff on my on going flight. Even without this incident I would still recommend the airline.
Super late due to mechanical issues sat on tarmac for three hours before finally deplaning at 130 am and told that we need to wait until at least 330 am for our flight. Given crackers and water on the plane. My flight to Manila from Dubai was also late causing me to miss my next flight. The cheap prices arent worth the inconvenience and waste of my time.
WUH to CKG on an A320. Flight on time even a little early. Clean cabin appearance seat pitch good. Foodsnack a little disappointment nothing salty just sweets. FA in good mood and friendly.
The reason for taking China United Airlines this time is that the ticket price is cheapFor the air tickets between Beijing and Shanghai the prices of other airlines are more than 1000 yuan. Only China United Airlines is 535 yuan. Because it is a lowcost airline there is no free checked luggage. The staff at the ground counter have a very good attitude and high efficiency. There is almost no queuing phenomenon. China United Airlines has only 737 aircraft and it has a full economy class layout. Compared with other lowcost airlines everyone of China United Airlines has sent a bottle of water which is good. I bought the meal through the app in advance but it was obviously not so delicious and affordable. The seat cant be adjusted. There is no entertainment system no small TV no WiFi in the whole cabin which is very bad.
Flew Air France from Naples to Paris CDG. What a great flight. The lounge at Naples Airport was great the quality of food is great. The boarding was very efficient. The staff on board were very kind and extremely helpful. The food was tasty and delicious pasta salad with Italian artichoke. Chicken with olives tapenades and as dessert a typical cake from Brittany. The drink champagne marvellous. Tea mint tea from me palaos du the very enjoyable. The flight was on time what a perfect day and flight.
This is my first time review for an airline company after my terrible experience with their customer service. Flair Airline refused my request to refund my money when I had mistake checking online. Im only have 1 check in bag and they were showing up my total amount 82 need to pay but I dont know why after I check out with my credit card I saw they charged me 2 check in bag and when I asked for refund they refused to do that. They told me that they cannot refund my money for the second one. Im okay with that only few dollars but I felt so terrible with the answer. I will never choose this airline again. Cheap price but bad service. Thanks
Singapore to Manchester. My return flight was even better then the outgoing one Again really comfortable seats I got nearly 8 hours of sleep during this 13.5hr flight. The entertainment was top notch as was the food and the service. Great airline and I hope to fly with them again
Flew to Banjul with Titian Airways as part of the Gambia experience from Gatwick on the 8th of March. Had a lovely flight all the staff were lovely. We returned on the 19th of March but unfortunately we had on board a drunken abusive passenger the cabin crew handled the situation very professionally and even whilst handling a most difficult situation they still treated all the other passengers brilliantly. The service was brill and all in all a brilliant flight hats off to Titan Airways.
One of the most comfortable Premium Economy seats. Brand new aircraft. Flights on time both outbound and inbound. Onboard staff very courteous and professional. Onboard WiFi probably the best connection I have experienced in the air. The only downsize is the food. So far the worse even compared to an average economy class. Food was disappointing. If not for the food I would have voted 1010.
I read a lot of negative reviews about this airlines lost luggage rude employees late or cancelled flights. We flew to Orlando and back this past week. I found the employees very polite and helpful. Our luggage did not get lost. The flight coming back from Orlando was late 30 minutes due to weather so that was understandable. My only issues is the width of the seats. Im a thin woman and I had only about 1.5 inches of seat space on each side. I think any man or people with a few extra pounds on them would be very uncomfortable sitting in such narrow seats.
I booked my flight with Turkish Airlines in the summer of 2020. Due to COVID they cancelled my flight 3 times. Eventually I just took the voucher planning to use it next year and spent a 1000 on another airline for my current trip. So next year comes along I try to book my ticket in the summer of 2021. They have only 2 flights a week. I spent hours on the website trying to find a flight within 1000. I cannot use the voucher online to pay for the ticket even though it was issued to me directly by Turkish Airlines. Turkish Airlines doesnt pick up their phone half the time. I wasted around 20 hours on Turkish Airlines trying to find good flights on the website and then on the phone trying to get a customer service agent to book my ticket online. When I have a flight reservation on hold that is within my budget Turkish Airlines tells me they cant book my flight on the phone. When the reservation hold has expired suddenly they can and tell me my options that cost me 2500. TLDR They refuse to give me a refund and refuse to let me book with my voucher.
Nice experience onboard the A351 quiet aircraft. Crew were rushed on the first sector from London Heathrow to Doha although no delay but second sector was very good from Doha to Kuala Lumpur. Crew professional and pleasant. Only setback is that the announcements for flights using buses to aircrafts were vague at DOH. Must be alert at all times.
Hanoi to Danang. Terrible airline and not necessarily cheap. I assumed luggage size and weight would be acceptable since me and my wife just had a backpack and 1 suitcase combined carry on size at the last moment before getting aboard one of the staff pulled my back to tell me to check my weight. The weight was above the allowed limit I felt like this was a last minute cash grab. We were given the option to pay extra to have the baggage taken into checked baggage if we paid about 22 USD. Beyond this there is nothing good on the plane and no free food to eat.
Connecting flight from San Juan to Antigua was supposed to leave at 3.20 but did not leave until 5.30. Okay fine it was my last leg and i didnt have a connecting flight thankfully but I cant say the same for the other passengers. We arrived in Antigua and waited for our luggage but were later informed that no ones luggage was put onto the plane and we all had to fill out reports. Its the day after my flight and an agent called and told me everyones luggage was still in San Juan and we would be called whenever it arrived but gave no indication if it would be a day or a week or a year. Never ever again will I fly with this airline.
We flew JNB to Seychelles on 21 April and back on 1 May 2015. The Cabin was good and the seat comfort very good not completely lie flat but very close and much more comfortable than Emirates Business Class. Service is what you would expect from Business class. Outward bound trip from Johannesburg was good. Nightmare was on Inbound trip. The flight departure time was 8am but at around 5pm the evening prior to the flight they sent an email out to the travel agents that they have moved the departure time 1 hour earlier. They didnt contact the customers themselves and no one with authority at Air Seychelles was available to talk to. For people on Mahe the 1 hour earlier departure wasnt the end of the world but for people on the outlying islands who relied on a regular ferry service there was no way to make our flight and flights for next 3 days were fully booked. In the end we had to charter a boat to get us to the airport on time we were the lucky ones others missed their flight completely. It seems that customer service is not something Air Seychelles understands. The flight back was uneventful except that 2 of the seats in business class were out of order and that the cabin staff were extremely noisy talking non stop at high volume throughout the flight. Sleeping wasnt easy but they just didnt care.
Karachi to Manchester via Doha traveling with my 27 week pregnant wife and a 4 year old son from. My wife felt slightly unwell during the first flight likely due to altitude and hypoxia however Qatar Airways was very helpful in getting her checked at the airport first by a paramedic and then in the airport clinic by the doctor. Later on they advised us to get further investigated and checked in a hospital hence they arranged an ambulance hospitalization travel from hospital to hotel arrangement of hotel and food vouchers on their own. It was really nice to have a feeling of being cared by the airline. Everyone was so humble and supportive. I could not have asked for a better service by the airline. Inflight was really good too. Nice comfy seats on Boeing 787 with good air pressure. I will recommend it completely. Thanks Qatar Airways.
Never fly with Saudia. They do not comply with aviation law. Very poor customer service. When you ask for help on the hotline you get kicked like a soccer. I was COVID positive and emailed Saudia customer care. They replied telling me to call customer care and explain the same problem again. That did not work either. At last I tried Saudia Lost baggage claim WhatsAp number. The result I lost my money and time.
Troms to Oslo. Easy online booking engine. Everything stored in a own personal account which is accessible through their homepage or own built app. Online checkin was made available 24h prior to departure and as I had no checked luggage I checked in online. 2h prior departure I got a friendly welcome onboard sms with flight details. As Id checked in online I could easily walk thru security and wait at the gate given in the sms. Boarding was quick as I had priority boarding bought and could get quickly onboard the aircraft. Crew greeting friendly and inflight entertainment was what we could expect from a low cost carrier want more wifi speed you have to pay for it. Flight was ok some turbulence but nothing to complain about. Pilot gave good information on why the turbulence occurred. All in all a pleasant flight and service according to the low cost carrier expectation they gave me upon booking the reservation. Not reaching 1010 as the fees was a bit to harsh if youd like to build your own reservation and fee for wifi usage onboard.
The customer service was terrible they were very rude to us and showed no interest in helping us. Be careful when purchasing something they will not refund your money no matter the circumstance. We purchased a ticket and canceled it right away they only refunded 75 of our money. If you try to call the airline they will not pick up it is only an answering machine. On the flight they do not provide water or snacks unless you are willing to pay for them. Overall we had a very bad experience with this airline. We will not be flying with them again.
The policy handbag accessory less than 12 kg can be accepted as legitimate but what happened because of its infraction was too harsh. If you go over even 2kg as in my case you cannot pay for extra weight. You have to pay 60 euros for hold baggage and that means that you have to use the machine and then hold the line to load the hold baggage. Ironically since my bag was 10kg less than 12kg they asked me if I wanted to carry it to the check in. The line got very long between the weighting line the hold line and the check in line and I almost lost the boarding time. They could just let me pay for my 2 kg extra on the place and it would have been a normal process. Next time I will try to avoid Air France.
New York JFK to Taipei with EVA Air. A great experience for me. Food was excellent seats are wide comfortable enough to stretch my legs FA is very friendly and very attentive English speaking. Cocktail drink was excellent. Toilet is very clean. I will fly to this airline again. Always on time.
After much contemplation about flying Sunwing again because of a less than satisfactory experience last year we decided to give them another chance and booked a trip to Panama with them. Once again we were left disappointed. We were enjoying our stay at the resort as such we inquired with Sunwing about extending our trip 3 days moving our flight from Friday to Monday. We spoke with the resort and confirmed that we could keep our room and that the cost would be 644. Sunwing advised that the total including the room would be 1675.00 to extend our stay by 3 days. Our total trip for one week which already included a flight home was 2025.00. To me this seems as though Sunwing was charging for flights all over again even though we were already there and had already paid for a flight back. We obviously decided to keep our original departure date and when it was time to chose seats we were unable to upgrade to Elite Plus as the seats were all blocked out this happened on the way there as well but when we got to the airport there were still Elite Plus seats available. Once again we reached out to Sunwing and they were unwilling to help and just kept telling us we had to talk to them at the airport and that we needed to book these seats 24 hours in advance but I tried to and was not able to as checkin can only be done 212 hours in advance of the flight. By the time we got to the desk at the airport there were no Elite Plus seats left together only sporadic seats spread throughout the plane. Since we have arrived home my husband has now noticed that his wallet was stolen from his checked bag and we have contacted Sunwing who once again has just said it was not turned in to them and we need to file a report with airport security. My advice to you spend the extra couple bucks and fly with another airline
Worst company. Never gonna take this company again I should have look at the reviews before booking. Hate their service The price can be good but youll prefer any other companies its a promise.
Booked 4 round trip flights from Lima to Cusco. Had to cancel two of the flights because of a Covid scare. Entered the names and documents ids for the two that were unable to attend and it canceled the return flights for my wife and I as well but none of the documentation showed which flights were cancelled and the reservation still looked the exact same on their website. It wasnt until attempting to check in that we realized what occurred. Had to rebook at a last minute price and use the entire voucher so now have to repurchase flights for the other two individuals. Customer service was extremely difficult to get in touch with and was no help when we finally did.
We a family of three had an afternoon flight from New Haven to RDU on 71623. We took the train from NYC and rode the bus to HVN. When we arrived at the gate we were told the flight was canceled because of weather. However the airport was flooded since the morning. I do not know why we got the notification so late. If we were notified early we could stay in NYC and arranged alternative much easier. Now we had to go back to NYC and try to take the overnight bus home because there were no other options. It cost us extra hundreds of dollar and a painful journey. Also the rebooking option from the cancelation notification text does not allow us to book any later days flight even though some are available from Avelos website. The entire week after was greyed out. I tried to call customer service rep but was on hold for an hour and was disconnected. It was very frustrating experience.
No lounge access at Mumbai even for business class only TG class does not provide this. All other airlines provide No amenities. No even a pair or socks No champagne they did offer a cheap and disgusting Prosecco No food or drink menus. Just a verbal and mechanical choice provided. Service attitude lacking big time. Cabin condition left a lot to be desired. Not going to fly TG business class unless I have no other option.
Due to heavy fog at Gatwick on 23rd January I was unable to arrive into Gatwick from Copenhagen to make it to my Emirates flight. Most flights were delayed 78 hours on arrival in Gatwick. I explained this to Emirates without luck. Gatwick only had departures and not arrivals from 6am to 2pm that day. Emirates refused to put me on the next flight despite explaining that it was not my fault. As a result I lost 500 Euros and had to go back to Copenhagen and my hotel bookings were lost. Holidays ruined by Emirates are not humane and they do not care about you
We travelled to Muscat from Manila Philippines last July 21 2023 via WY 844. Me and my husband have an infant and a 2year old kid travelling with us. We checked in with a long line but fortunately have checked with the ground crew that I can fall in line in Business Class lane since I am a Sindbad Silver holder. Everything was smooth until the boarding. They prioritized us boarding the plane because I am a Sindbad Silver member and I have an infant and kid travelling with me. Unfortunately an hour after the plane take off we complained already with the flight attendant to adjust the air conditioners temperature since it is hot. They said they will not knowing that there was indeed a problem with the airconditioning. For the whole flight it was really hot. No one from the crew apologized on the condition and for the passengers we just have no other choice but to pacify ourselves.
Fes to Marrakech. Booked 7 weeks before travel travel time changed 3 times last time by email at 18.55 the night before travel. Air Arabia charged extra for luggage. Each time they sent through new flight details and each time the 30Kg luggage Id paid extra for in advance disappeared. The last flight time was too late for me to travel so I took the early train. Air Arabia have refused to refund me and refused to refund the extra baggage I paid for even though the extra luggage didnt fly. I couldnt recommend Air Arabia to anyone.
This was not my first time flying business with Kenya Airways but it was definitely not the best. The Plaza lounge at LHR was not serving alcohol on the basis that the food was not substantial. Boarding was chaotic although there was a business line everyone was using it. After eventually getting on the aircraft and after a long wait I was offered a small glass of champagne. Seating was oldstyle parallel pair business was about half full and there were signs of ageing. It then took an inordinate amount of time for the meal to be served choice was meat or chicken. It was probably the first time ever that the starter and main course were both rice. The flight was uneventful and although not fully flatbed I did manage to sleep. No bottle of water was provided. Breakfast was a small dry croissant yogurt and a small bowl of fruit. I know airlines are struggling but given how much I paid for the ticket to have a service which was not as good as premium economy on some other airlines was frustrating. If Kenya Airways wants to compete with its rivals it needs to stop pennypinching and offer its business customers a level of service which justifies what they have paid.
Venice to Paris. Ive flown with Air France 6 times in my life and each time I regret it. Twice I had my luggage misplaced for days. Second to last flight I was separated from my family members due to the flight being overbooked I checked in online a day prior. The staffs statement was Air France has the right to overbook a flight. What does that even mean That Air France has the right to be unorganised and ruin a customers schedule The last flight I had a terrible encounter with 2 rude staff who insists that I have not paid for checked in luggage. They refused to even look at the receipts I shown them stating If we say you must pay then you must pay. Only after a lengthy argument she finally found that we indeed has paid No apologies whatsoever.
Barcelona to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific Airways. This flight did not live up to expectations promised by the Go Beyond advertising. Boarding was efficiently managed although the flight departed nearly an hour late. As a regular long haul traveler I look forward to the airline food and normally choose the Asian option as I have done very well on other carriers based in Asia. However it was very disappointing so I assume the budget had been cut to the minimum. Cabin crew were polite but often not around much between meal times. The A350 has good sized screens for entertainment however the choice was limited. I will probably look at other flight options next time.
I find Qatar Airways to be my favorite airline at the moment. The whole experience from booking to traveling to end destination is very professional and easy. I had to make changes to my return journey so I called Qatar after hours my time my call was answered straight away the lady said that she could make change for me AUD 60 or alternatively I could do it myself online AUD 11. I chose to change myself online very easy. As for my flight this week PERDOHLYS it was great even though it was in economy the food was much better that other airlines flown recently. Ill definitely be choosing Qatar where ever possible in the future.
We booked a flight from Faro to Stockholm with a stopover in Amsterdam and paid extra for the carryon trolley. When boarding we were told we could not bring the carryon in the plane. I explained we have a stopover and we didnt want to checkin our bags. The ground crew got quite aggressive and unprofessional and we were basically forced in handing over our carryon trolleys. The labels were being handwritten which was adding to my concern. The ground crew told us Dont worry your baggage will go to Stockholm. As expected on arrival in Stockholm our baggage was lost and nobody could tell us where it is. Avoid Transavia at all cost if your baggage is precious to you.
I travel a lot and I never thought Qatar Airways would be my best options for travelling to USA . The crew were lovely and so helpful on ground and in the plane they were so friendly and professional and they treat all passengers nicely. Doha Airport were amazing and the duty free has a lot of options. The most important that they were on time. The food were so nice and they will never let you miss a meal even if you sleep the crew wake you up to ask you for food and bring it ASAP .
Maun to Cape Town. Never use this airline. Denied boarding because of a supposedly faulty passport. Forced to buy connecting ticket out of Cape Town forced to leave my family and not join them on vacation. On arrival in Cape Town authorities did not find an issue with passport. The price for a ticket was already high and now the additional flight out of Cape Town that I did not use cost me another 700 dollars
New York to Singapore. We purchased the extra legroom seats for 120 per personper flight. They are the worst seats ever. Yes you get lots of legroom but you lose window there are no windows at these seats which is not told when you go onto the site to book sleep the lights never fully go out because you are right by the bathroom plus you have the bathroom light shining in your face because no one ever closes the door and you have to listen to the nonstop clicking of the bathroom door your legroom because people use your space to stand and stretch their legs and this is not monitored by the flight attendants. You are in the section with the crying babies there is an actual section for babies. There is no storage space so you have to put all of your stuff in the overhead bin and you have to stow your tv during takeoff and landing so there is a good hour of just sitting there while everyone else is watching tv. I cant believe we paid 500 for these terrible seats. If I had known I would have kept the cattle seats and stretched my legs on my way to the bathroom. Personally I think you should get a discount for sitting in these seats.
We had a terrible experience checking in with Aeromexico in Mexico City. We bought our return flights with WestJet with whom we have free baggage. The staff at Aeromexico stated that they were unable to verify the free baggage claiming that they dont have a partnership with WestJet. The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful lacking customer service skills.
Delhi to Sydney via Singapore. The first leg from Delhi was with Jet Airways to be followed by the Sydney leg with Qantas. The Jet Airways flight was half an hour late and it was obviously decided before we landed that we would not be allowed to board the ongoing leg as we were collected and ushered to get new boarding passes for a much later flight. We were then offered a flight only 3.5 hours later with Singapore Airlines and the staff at Singapore Airport completed all the documentation including the transferring of our bags. But all our bags have gone missing and did not turn up in Sydney. I realise that they are still in tracking mode however we are desperate to get them back before Christmas. We have tried all day calling Singapore Airlines but they do not answer.
Chicago to Tokyo. The absolute best airline Ive ever flown. If the price is close Ill always choose ANA in the future. Wonderful service comfortable seat great food awesome lounge at Narita Airport in Japan. Cant say enough great things about this airline.
JAL didnt disappoint for the most part. The checkin at Haneda was fast and accommodating. I say accommodating because they checked my luggage all the way through to my final destination on American Airlines connecting flight despite the fact that these were two separate tickets. It seems a small thing but it was major for me as JFK is a nightmare to connect through. On top of that the agent gave me my boarding pass for the American flight Onboard both directions the seats were wide and comfortable. Im very large and I didnt feel particularly cramped or hindered even when in full recline. The seat cushions themselves are a bit thin but they do have the extra air weave pads to help with this. Looking around the cabin you cant help but feel it needs a refresher but it is perfectly comfortable. The service onboard was kind and fast They have an onboard order as you like service after the main meal and the food comes to you incredibly fast. The handset ordering function for this food was brokenunavailable both directions but the response time of the FA was speedy. The food was good and you will not starve. However if you are particular about your diet in any way you may wish to order special meals. The western and the Japanese meals one way both featured beef which I dont eat. With the large a la carte menu it is easy enough to work around but I found the set menus of the first meals to be really limited. AVOD was adequate and better than I remembered. Luggage delivery on the return from JFK was very slow even for priority service. Ill probably fly them again especially on the Haneda flights internationally.
George to Johannesburg. We book tickets for our two grandchildren twice a year. As they have to fly as unaccompanied minors I have to make the booking through the call center. The fare indicated on the website for the specific flights was R1 182.21 per person for the return flights between Johannesburg and George. Before I gave all the traveler details I asked the operator what I would have to pay and was informed that it would be R2364.42 per child. This excluded the R100.00 per ticket to be charged because I booked through the call center. When I called back to find out if the children had been accepted as unaccompanied minors for the flight and to make the payment the amount was suddenly R2957.22 per child. That is 25 times more than when one would and could book on the internet On checking the eticket per childone finds the following info Fare calculation R697.50 x 2 R1 395.00 rounded off to R1 400.00 plus taxes totaling R461.22 and carrier imposed fees R 1096.00 which brings the total to R2 957.22 per child.
My wife suffers from panic attacks and I am diabetic. We booked months in advance and paid a premium so we could select our needed seats. In Atlanta our plane was changed to a larger one at the last minute. We were downgraded and given seats in different cabins. We are seniors and our medical conditions require us to be together when traveling in case of problems. While trying to explain that to the boarding agent she was rude uncaring and refused to listen to the issue we were having. Absolutely no effort was taken to try to fix our issue. She asked us to step aside and then after everyone else had boarded she said to take our assigned seats or lose them. Luckily a very kind man sitting next to my wife did hear what we were saying at boarding and offered to switch seats with me. We have not received any compensation nor offer thereof for the downgrade at this time. On the plane flight attendants repeatedly ignored request for something to drink. In SLC I decided to double check our seats that were confirmed just 12 hrs before. Our seats had been sold out from under us. We had no seats on the plane at all. Luckily this gate agent did listen and was able to get us 2 seats in our original section. Avoid flying Delta at all costs of you have health issues. are handicapped. or a senior citizen. They only care about and not the passenger.
Service was nearly nonexistent both on the ground and airborne. The flight attendant was seriously involved with her hair and was unavailable to assist passengers. I was aware that Thai Airasia was a low cost airline but I was unprepared for how lacking in service the airline is.
Taipei to Vancouver. I was impressed with the comfort and service. The staff was very friendly they were prompt with meal time and very accommodating. The take off and landing were quite smooth and I was happy with how painless the boarding was. The food was pretty good with enough in the meal to fill me up for hours. For economy class the seats were decently comfortable and the leg room was more than I was expecting. I loved the touch screens and the quantity of movie choices. My overall experience was as comfortable and painless as a flight can be. I would recommend this airline to anyone looking to take a lengthy flight.
Took TR SINMFM on 6 October 2014. Flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. Seat was okay though there was quite a jostle between other passengers trying to squeeze their numerous hand carry into the limited overhead compartments. Ordered the double croissant chicken ham meal and it was surprisingly very good. The croissants was flaky the flakes were crispy and it was warm moist and buttery inside. Service was prompt and friendly. For the rates offered could have flown fullservice airlines like CX or SQ on promo fare to HK instead. However as no other airlines fly the SINMFM route this is the best and only option so far.
London Heathrow to Vancouver return.Both flights were punctual but sadly the 747400 aircraft used are now beginning to look their 20 plus years of age especially compared to the A380s BA have used on this route. The cabin is looking rather tired and worn and the seats are not comfortable enough for a 9 hour flight. I was very pleased to have booked an exit row seat for additional room. The IFE system is also quite dated and limited compared to modern offerings. On the plus side the cabin staff were friendly helpful and courteous and this is somewhere BA seem to do well. Food and drink were complimentary and of decent quality for economy class. Boarding at YVR was very well organised less so at the Heathrow end. It is also a shame that these flights depart from the cramped Terminal 3 at Heathrow. Overall a reasonable experience but one that they could improve to excellent with a bit more polish.
Bought 2 tickets on Pegasus airlines to Istanbul with the special offer Free changes This meant that I could change my travels dates without paying the change fee which was a great deal due to the current global pandemic. However when I wanted to change my flight the mobile app and web app were both down. I called customer service and was told the system was being restarted and I could only make changes over the phone or wait. Since my flight was that day and I needed to change it ASAP since Turkey had just announced they would be introducing restrictions and new measures that day. Obviously I wasnt about to travel and needed to change my ticket. So I asked the customer service representative whether I could change my ticket free of charge over the phone since I had no other option of no fault of my own. She said she would have to charge me the change fee and I could then ask for a refund which I would get since it wasnt my fault. After sending in 2 complaints and multiple emails Pegasus airlines still refuses to refund the fee. Not to mention all the money I spent on the customer service call even though THEIR SYSTEM WAS DOWN.
Have used the internal flight Sofia to Burgas a number of times over the last three years. Last trip was three weeks ago. Fantastic value for money. I find its the best transport mode for connecting the Capital to the Black Sea.
Dubai to Singapore flight was delay and I missed my connecting flight to Hong Kong. As it was airline mistake they booked me on the next flight departing to Hong Kong after 5 hours. The staff at Singapore Airport arrival was not much helpful they gave me SGD 15 meal voucher and asked me to wait in the public waiting area.
I really like bmi Regional. On an hour long flight from Brno to Munich they offer free drinks and a tasty sandwich. The flight attendant was very pleasant and the seats are very comfortable with generous leg room that you wouldnt expect on such a small aircraft. On time departure and arrival. I wouldve appreciated more information about the route but other than that it was a great experience and I would travel with bmi Regional anytime. As we were travelling with a child the flight attendant even gave us extra pretzels.
The flight legroom was good that the only positive side I could remember. The service is horrible food and drink menu absolutely rubbish. So selection for nonveg. More over the food not even pack individually serving like buffet. When web check in not even give option to choose meal type. I dont know the cabin crew do feedback to company. This is not one time my parents travelled up and down Cochin to Gatwick had same service not all human beings are potato and lentil eaters.
First I bought the ticket via Vietnam Airlines only to end up being operated by Pacific Airlines. Ground staff at checking in were the rudest Ive encountered to the point I had to complain to the manager nearby who apologized. Once through security at the boarding gates it was absolute chaos. Gates constantly changed all flights delayed from Pacific what a nightmare. Once arrived in Da Nang I realized they had broken my luggage to which they said they could only offer 150000VND. Thats all unbelievable. Avoid at all costs
Nice to Paris CDG. This short flight was to Paris CDG. I was concerned as according to schedule I only had one hour and five minutes to catch my connecting flight to Dublin. However the flight actually arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule and I even had time to visit the Air France lounge in CDG. It was a pleasant surprise that the chief steward addressed me by name The service was impeccable and a small collation offered. The cabin crew handled the situation extremely well when people were getting on board with more hand luggage and stuff than they should. Surely management could address this The crew already have a difficult job without having to deal with passengers who whinge when there is no place in the cabin for their stuff
I counted at least 12 people in the plane who did not have a mask on during the entire flight which was 5 hours which his clearly a violation from passengers. I talked to 2 flighs attendants about reinforcing passengers to wear the mask. The 2 flight attendants said they were doing the best they could but they cannot force people to wear the mask for real I feel Turkish airline put my health was in jeopardy. I filed a complaint with international airline association. Lastly in November 29 As we tried to land for 1 and 12 hour we had no communication from Pilots or flight attendants. People knew something was wrong plane kept going up and down tried to land once. No communication. Finally the pilot said we will go to an other airport because the weather conditions were bad We landed at Curlu airport and stayed In the plane for 2 hours in the ground. No communication at all. Finally we were let go in the middle of nowhere I decide to take a cab to go to Istanbul that cost me 60 euros. I felt that the pilot need to get some customer relationship classes as they did not respect their passengers I am flying back to Europe in 10 days will forfeit my return flight and will get an other airline
Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok. Worst airline ever. My friend and I were traveling all over SE Asia for two weeks when I first flew AirAsia instead of taking buses and trains all over we decided it would be best to fly since the prices werent bad at all. Several of our flights were close to an hour late I was very crammed in the seat and if the people in front of you want to lay their seats in your lap the seats recline far back enough to do so. The flight attendants have no problem getting uncomfortably close in an attempt to have you turn your phone totally off.
Dubai to Dusseldorf with Emirates. I got a free lastmoment upgrade from Economy to Business. Flight experience was great crew very attentive and helpful. Free floating Veuve Clicquot very well mixed drinks and food choice. The full flat beds were extremely comfortable and the space was more than enough I couldnt see my neighbor. Also I liked the idea of having your own minibar next to you. But I missed an amenity kit. This was a little bit of a negative point. Also there was a little bit of confusion during checkin. A lot of business passengers did not find their assigned waiting zone. The free Wifi is great albeit quite slow. Massive entertainment program like no other. All in all a great experience.
Excellent airline travelled a number of times with them and never had any problems. Latest flight ZB7504 on 281114 return ZB7505 on 121214 34 mins early at TFS and 25 mins early on return to LBA. Great cabin staff and flight crew. Awaiting to book our next flight with Monarch.
Xian to Kuala Lumpur. It was an overnight 5 hr flight and we purchased Premium Flatbed class. The tickets included meals as a separate line item. We checked in online but were told to check in again in the airport. The checkin counter for Premium class was very slow. Once in the aircraft we had one bottle of water each next to our seats and nothing else was offered. In flight service in general was nonexistent. Flatbeds were great. It was first experience when the airline neglected to provide part of the service. Most likely we would never fly AirAsia X again and wouldnt recommend it.
Jakarta to Surabaya. The service from Batik Air is very bad I always travel using the same hand carry luggage for the past 7 years I have taken Citilink Garuda and others. There have never been any problems. This time I was questioned even though the size of the suitcase could still be put in the place they provided but it still forced me to go back down to the checkin place to put this in as luggage. I have to pay for this hand carry as excess baggage with a very expensive amount. Staff cannot provide solid reasons why this suitcase can be oversized while this suitcase is enough for hand carry. Pelayanan dari batik air sangat buruk saya selalu travel menggunakan hand carry luggage yang sama selama 7 tahun belakangan ini saya naik citilink garuda dan lain nya tidak pernah ada masalah. Kali ini saya di permasalahkan padahal size koper masih bisa di masukkan di tempat yang mereka sediakan tetapi tetap memaksa saya untuk kembali turun ke tempat check in untuk memasukkan ini sebagai bagasi. Saya harus membayar handcarry ini sebagai bagasi berlebih dengan jumlah yang sangat mahal. Pelayan sangat disrespectful terhadap customer dan tidak bisa memberikan alasan yang solid kenapa koper ini bisa kebesaran sementara koper ini cukup untuk hand carry
Found a great deal and flew with JAL when I traveled from southeast Texas to Singapore. JAL staff in Seattle werent particularly friendly but JAL staff at Narita were quite pleasant and helpful in my brief interactions with them. The quality of the meal and drinks were quite satisfactory for economy class. They had a decent selection of entertainment from around the world including some Japanese movies that I ended up watching with English subtitles. The plane and lavatories were clean the onflight personnel the utmost in being pleasant and professional. One flight attendant in particular Cindy from Singapore chatted with me about Singapore for a minute and wished me safe and enjoyable travels to that city. Something else I got up and went to the toilet and came back only to find my neck pillow missing Im convinced that some passenger stole it. Who does that steal a nondescript black neck pillow At any rate I disembarked the plane after landing at Narita right before walking out of the jetway I still wanted to try to at least make one more effort to find that neck pillow. I explained to the flight staff that I was looking for a pillow and it had gone missing. 56 flight attendants sprung into action with me to look for that pillow. While it was never found I made sure to smile and say Thank you I have a hard time imagining that that level of service would ever occur on a North American airline. The only reason that Ive reduced JALs rating from 9 to 7 is because trying to call email or contact them otherwise through my online JAL account about changing flights is absolutely like pulling teeth this has been a problem for a different trip than this one. JAL desperately needs to work on aspects of their offflight customer service at least for nonJapanese customers. Nonetheless theyre still one of the truly best airlines in the world.
Bucharest to Cologne I paid a reservation ticket for preferential seat but at check in another random seat without explanation was assigned to me. No one answered until now to my request to refund the money. Both onboard and checkin Blue Air staff need to learn to communicate. Extremely rude and incompetent staff.
Kunming to Los Angeles via Chengdu. Sichuan Airlines and the way it treats its customers is completely unacceptable. They not only cancelled our international flight last minute one we had booked months prior but refused to help us over customer service and gave us two terrible options to either fly home two entire days later or get a refund. There was no way we could fly home that much later due to other commitments health issues and connecting flights so we were forced to take the refund. Even then our refund has not come in and they are refusing to get back to us. They should not only have gotten our refund immediately but compensated us for having to pay for a last minute international flight. I have never been more frustrated and upset with an airline.
They canceled the flight as we were heading into the airport with no heads up or anything. When we got to the airport too there was only one employee at check in. If I could give Frontier a zero I would but unfortunately I cant so Frontier gets a 1. Please save yourself some brain cells and stress and find another airline to fly with. They dont even have a customer service phone line because they know they are a bad airline and if they had one hundreds of customers would be asking for the help they desperately need. I cannot stress this enough DONT FLY WITH FRONTIER.
All flights were cancelled at Terminal 1 NAIA due to technical problems. All passengers of Eva Air BR278 were waiting in line For about an hour and there was no one at the check in counter to explain what we do next and only a piece of paper showing contact numbers were given to us to rebook. My first time to fly Eva Air because my husband had very good things to say about the airline. The flight was to depart to Taipei at 1850 and I have a connecting flight to LAX at 2355. There was no one at the Check in counter and the Office was closed at 5pm. Text Message to my Phone about flight cancellation was received at 431pm and paper with contact information was passed around at around 445pm.
Thank you Qatar for trying to make the trip secure and enjoyable. Although flight was full from KTM to Doha Doha to IAD passengers were spaced nicely. Pricing mask and Face shield in Kathmandu was reassuring. Service was excellent as always. Despite ticket being cancelled twice before our flight because it was not Qatar Airways fault I am very happy with your service.
Sydney to Bali. Worst experience ever. I had a very unpleasant situation with Malindo Air. I bought tickets to Bali however about a 6 weeks before my travel I found out that I may not be able to travel these dates so I contacted the customer service to find out if its possible to return those tickets and how much I could get back. They told me to fill the request form and wait for the answer. Thats what I did. I was waiting patiently and as I was not receiving any answer in the meantime I was doing my best to be able to travel on the planned days. Then just a week before my travel when I was ready to go I received a refund which was 150 out of 600 I paid. No email no message just a bank transfer. I contacted them again saying Id like to get either my tickets or the money back as it is all some kind of misunderstanding. Malindo replied that my tickets were bought under promotional offer and they are unreturnable so all I can get back is tax thad I had paid. Well the point is that my tickets werent super saver but value. I had bought them through official website plus I had purchased extra luggage so I dont understand how come my tickets became promotional and nonrefundable. At some point they just started ignoring my emails. How professional is that I am not happy the way they dealt with this situation. Im truly offended by the way the company treated me. All customers should matter not only those who dont have any complications. Thats the first time that a professional company made me feel offended. Ill definitely never use Malindo Air again and none of the people I know will either.
Flight D7532 25th of March 2023 I booked premium with meals from Osaka to KL and then to Kota Kinabalu return for my work. Before departure I was emailed with notice that a change of aircraft had occurred. So before leaving KL to go to Kota Kinabalu I reconfirmed with AirAsia staff at KL that I had a seat in premium for the 7 hour return journey to Osaka and that my meal had been booked. The ground staff at KL assured me this was correct. However on my return journey from KL to Osaka I was directed to an economy seat. When I complained that my work had paid for a premium seat I was ignored by cabin staff then a staff said he would contact the ground crew and then an English speaking cabin staff said that I could ask for a refund. I told her I didnt want a refund as I dont want to spend 7 hours in cramped conditions. She then said I would be removed from the plane if I didnt sit down so I had no choice but to return to the economy seat. When I returned to my seat someone else had taken it as they wanted to sit next to their friend. This then resulted in meal confusion. There was no soap in the toilet I used.
Worst airline ever Just when you think it cant get any worse it does. I paid for my suitcase when I purchased my ticket but because it was a little bigger they made me pay an additional fee as if it were sports equipment. I purchased water in the airport but they would not allow me to bring on plane. They dont serve anything on the flight. Not even water no TVs or any form of entertainment. First and last time traveling this airline. Horrible customer service
Miami to London Gatwick. First time flying with Norwegian I was very unimpressed how they weigh your carry ons. I had a small pull along suitcase full of my babies essentials for the flight and was told it was too heavy and I would have to pay 15 a kilo my suitcase was over by 3 kilos also and the lady serving us just grunted pointed to the left and shouted go go come back when you sort. The flight was ok the seats were comfy the TV was actually pretty snazzy and cool but on a long haul flight I was shocked that food is not included free. This is a company that does not strive for positive customer feedback they offer cheap flights and its a take it or leave it scenario. If you need a cheap flight I suppose its great however if your looking to start your holiday off cheery and happy I suggest flying with someone else.
London to New York JFK with British Airways and abyssal customer service. Onboard the flight can be great and its the website and shoddy call centre staff who let them down. However this time the onboard service was as bad as the ground service. Food was poor. I was in the upper deck with only 5 other business class passengers and yet my food choice was gone. The TVs didnt work in 2 seats I couldnt be bothered to try a third and decided to just get some sleep. The staff insisted on forming a cliquish huddle and were speaking so loudly I couldnt even sleep with ear plugs in.
We had all boarded and then it was announced that there will be a 30 mins delay. Surely the staff would have been aware of this delay and not board passengers till issues resolved But ok things happen no big deal. Then the food options were announced absolutely disgusted with the food choices Our flight was at 9.30am so obviously breakfast service 2 choices were muesli with yogurt or egg sausage fritter no fruit salad no bread roll. Nothing Since we dont eat pork or beef we ended up not eating anything at all and the drinks were only served once. I have flown with this airline numerous times and drinks have always been served twice. So after delay flight we arrived at our destination starving. Prices of fares have gone up while the rest of services provided have gone very down. Very disappointed and will most definitely will only be using this airline as a last resort. if ever again
La Paz to Uyuni. Due to weather issues the airline understandably cancelled our flight to Uyuni upon learning that rebooking was not an option due to tour constraints we were assured we would be reimbursed and provided the link to give our information. That was June and in November we still have not received the reimbursement much less any information about it. Despite filling out the paperwork multiple times and sending followup inquiries they are incredibly unresponsive and have not provided any indication that we will ever see this reimbursement. If you book this airline be aware their customer service is extremely poor.
DUSVIE. Very friendly and motivated staff. Best standard service of the German speaking airlines.
Nice to Oslo. Very poor customer support. The website couldnt proceed for several days the payment with my foreign credit cards with 3D authorization. No proper explanation were given customer service line couldnt help. In the end had to book through another online service and the airline declined to apply my rewards. Wired service and absolutely unhelpful.
Great service on both flights from Hamburg to Dubai and Dubai to Hong Kong. Smooth transits and punctual departures. Excellent and helpful crews and very professional and attentive service on both flights. Great food excellent wines and the best entertainment system. Emirates never disappoints.
Flight JJ8064 Sao Paolo to Madrid March 30th 2014. Having read some very poor reviews we were a little nervous when our agent recommended this flight. However we were pleasantly surprised. Staff were friendly and helpful the food was not quite up to LAN standards but more than acceptable and served with some very nice wines. The seats were not quite lieflat but comfortable enough and we were given nice duvets and pillows. The little flight pack was well put together and useful especially the warm socks Business Class lounge in Sao Paolo was OK not great and we gave up trying to connect to the Wifi It was nice and quiet though. The flight arrived 30mins early in Madrid and the bags arrived quickly. They have a bit of a way to go to catch up with LAN but would say that they are getting there
My Flights on June 9 was cancelled due to COVID 19 I contacted the company many times to get my money back but the company is not helping at all. They only offered a voucher I dont want a voucher a want my money back. Flights was cancelled due to The pandemic No for personal reasons. When I called the company only give me the option for the voucher or Send me to just fly to claim the credit. I been bouncing between both companies with not help and results. I know but the law that I am entitled to get my money back since the pandemic. Customer service need more training and be more helpful at this point Im still waiting for the company response on this issue but I didnt heard anything yet. I will never buy again a flight on air Europa or inJust fly is the worst experience
Some friends and I were flying from Zurich to San Jose del Cabo. We booked Economy Comfort seats using the Aeromexico homepage. First disappointment At the airport they said something didnt work they cannot seat us at the booked economy comfort seats and we got very bad middle seats. At least it was said the charge for the seats gets refunded since its clearly seen what was booked and where we are seated. Several other people had the same issue in fact everyone who booked a seat upgrade online the queue at the service desk was therefore quite long. Second and even worse disappointment I got in contact with Aeromexico for the refund a month later I got the answer that there will be no refund and they are sorry for the inconvenience. This is just fraud they double booked and got paid for the economy comfort seats in advance online and then again on site and refuse to refund a performance not rendered. Never again.
The only experience I had before with Qatar was a ticket purchased though ASAP tickets which turned out to be a disaster. I was going to meet my girlfriend in Panama. She ran into a problem on the second leg of the trip because of needing to have a visa to change planes in USA and needed a visa for that. They had a flight a few hours later which would not of been a problem. Qatar said she needed to go though ticket agency. ASAP did nothing to help and blamed it on Qatar. After trying for three weeks with is both paying hotel rooms they could not help since all their flights went though USA. I later checked with them about a flight and it is no problem going though Spain which was no problem. Canceled the trip and we both went home to separate countries. I will not use ASAP again and was able to get a refund from credit card company on her trip. Of course by then spending time thousands of dollars and way to much stress. Never thought I would use Qatar again either. Another trip to Thailand and Qatar was the best deal and schedule so against my better judgment I tried them again. What a surprise. Everything went very easy I had to change flight twice because of visa issues but no charge and easy to do. Everything about my flight was great. I didnt have a hard copy of some paperwork so they printed it out me. The people were exceptional. This is my new favorite airline.
I missed my flight from Leeds to Geneva airport as I was late. My though is the customer service clerks of Jet2.com at BradfordLeeds. The two women working that morning at the customer service desk were so rude to me. The customer service clerks in Geneva were so professional gracious and nice. Geneva to Leeds the airhostesses only smiled and said hello to the white customers but not to customers of color all I received was a long hard and unfriendly stare I paid my airticket and I believe that I deserve to be accorded the same hospitality as other passengers. All my experience with jet2.com is a zero star. One thing I must say is that the aircraft was clean comfortable and value for money.
Awful experience sat in the plane for 2.4 hours as they tried to repair a door that wouldnt close then a parking brake that wouldnt disengage. They deboarded us and after about 45 mins had us board a different plane and it had a problem with its door too. Another hour in the plane waiting for repairs. And then they wanted to charge us for sodas and chips. Found out our flight is late 60 of the time. Never flying this airline again I cant imagine theyll be around very long anyway.
Buenos Aires to Rio Grande. When you enter a plane of aerolineas you immediately fall on the reward of Trip it gives confidence. Mistake our 2 flights were incredible both late 25 minutes for the first and 130 for the second no information we only warn you when the boarding time arrives quietly. Following the bad reviews on the forums and the endless malfunction of the website we decided to go to the Ushuaia agency to get info on our flight back which was currently nonexistent. ou arrive at check in and there are twenty people at the opening count 10 to 15 minutes per person minimum. The flight late in a dirty plane the hostesses jostle splashes and the breakfast is served by running because it seems that it is already very late to do so and for good reason we land almost at the same time. Add to that the difficulties to pay a ticket on the site the total lack of communication no response on any media available thats a lot for the same company. In short we are far from paradise. Lowend company at a bargain price FR Quand vous entrez dans un avion daerolineas vous tombez de suite sur la recompense de Trip ca donne confiance. Erreur nos 2 vols ont ete incroyables les deux en retards 25 minutes pour le premiers et 1h30 pour le second aucune information on ne vous previent quon moment ou lheure dembarquement arrive tranquillement. Lenregistrement est long mais long 40 minutes pour passer une trentaine de personnes. Suite aux mauvaises critiques sur les forums et au dysfonctionnement sans fin du site internet nous avons decide de nous rendre dans lagence dUshuaia pour avoir des infos sur notre vol de retour qui etait pour linstant inexistant... Bin alors la faut oublier vous arrivez a lagence et il y a une vingtaine de personnes a louverture comptez 10 a 15 minutes par personne minimum... Le vol en retard dans un avion sale les hotesses sont de vraies brutes on vous bouscule vous eclabousse et le petitdej est servi en courant car il semblerait quil soit deja tres tard pour le faire et pour cause on atterrit presque en meme temps. Ajoutons a cela les difficultes pour payer un billet sur le site labsence totale de communication aucune reponse sur aucun des medias dispos cela fait beaucoup pour la meme compagnie. Bref on est loin du paradis. Pour le divertissement rien sauf leur show des passagers nonenregistres qui se presentent a lembarquement ah oups on a oublie une personne en chaise roulante en bas desole... Compagnie bas de gamme a un prix classe affaire
Flew from LGWBCN on the A320 seated in seats 2D2F. Lounge at Gatwick prior to boarding was very nice offered good food and drink selection including champagne on request. Cabin crew friendly and attentive. I was a bit apprehensive about BAs new business class product but the seat was comfortable and having the middle seat free does allow for more room although the leg room is a little tight but okay for a short flight. We were served a cold meal which was quite tasty along with complimentary drinks. I would recommend British Airways.
Travelled British Airways from London Heathrow to Buenos Aires return in Business Class. Business class layout is terrible with very narrow seats which are arrangend in way that almost in any seat you book somebody will step over you during the night or you have to step over somebody else. In addition there are screens between and your neighbors seat which flight attendants have to move up and down when they want to serve passengers who do not have an aisle seat. I cant imagine how stupid the person who created this layout must have been. It is not comfortable for passengers nor is it for flight attendants. Very sticky atmosphere due to this odd arrangement of seats. In terms of service this was lousy on both flights. There are about 4 flight attendants for about 40 Business Class seats. The flight attendants are quite old. It takes them a long time to get you something to drink on the table after takeoff. They move through the cabin twice with drinks before they serve dinner and desert. Afterwards you dont see them and they may not show up even if you press the call button. Their attitude is by and large correct but very formal and impersonal. They clearly dont display any signs of fun or interest in the customer. Food was reasonable. No Wifi available at all.
Virgin Australia seems to be a company based on greed. A company that ignores the facts when they are wrong treat loyal customers of many years terribly that simply seem unequipped to handle their mistakes is a company that both unethical and greedy. On this flight I was in the lounge as is usual the flight was delayed by 40 minutes. When they called for boarding the delayed flight I went to the gate to be told it was closed. When it was called we used the toilet then went straight to the gate. Put simply the time that the flight was called with the time it took to walk to gate was not enough. Returning the lounge I was told in the most awful manner I had to leave and re enter rudel and then charged 300 for the next flight for myself and my employee. I followed up with customer service. They sent an email that completely ignored the situation and told me that you should get the flight 30 min before departure. What is the point of the lounge calling the flight if it isnt correct. Beyond that the customer service completely ignored the actual situation and just told me rules that didnt apply to the situation. I am transitioning over to another airline now but be warned. On the surface they seems very approachable but in reality they are crooked greedy and backward in their approach to the customers. Cursing feels more suited to the situation but this review will have to do.
I was very fortunate to fly business with Air France first Toronto to Paris after being bumped by WestJet and taking a flight a few hours later which was excellent. Then even better was my flight Paris to Vancouver with the lovely and very efficient flight attendant. I felt her performance alone deserved attention for how special it was. The food and wine was extraordinary no request was too much and I enjoyed getting to try to converse in French. I dont write a lot of reviews and I usually travel Star Alliance but for Air France Ill gladly make exceptions going forward I will see Air France in business again in April to Paris and Lisbon I cant wait
Toronto to London in WTP on a 787 and London to Toronto in club world on 747. There were elements of both flights where BA seemed to be back to their old self. The Dreamliner in WTP was on time with some of the best cabin service Ive experienced from a male attendant who smiled couldnt do enough and was just professional. BA seemed to have dropped some of the nice touches though so no hot towel soft drink before take off or menu cards looks like WTP seems to have been demoted again. Fast bar service and good entree before the WTP service morphed into WT for breakfast which has reverted to muffin or nuffin and Ts and Cs and juice from paper cups. It really is an insult after an overnight flight and is ill thought out and penny pinching. Landing early at Heathrow and fast bags ended a good overall flight. The return flight in club was one of my best ever. The lounge had a better range of hot and cold food though most of the furniture still needs replacing. On board two male crew upstairs on the jumbo were superb. Friendly helpful and starting off well with a 2nd champagne before take off due to delays in boarding. Fast bar service and an excellent lunch with the sea bass being exceptional. A calm oasis on the upper deck allowed some sleep before the now tired afternoon tea was served. Real personalised service with a smile reminded me of old times of BA at its best. An on time landing and fast bags off finished an excellent flight. Why cant they do this more often Answer variable cabin crew.
London to Johannesburg. Since the aircraft was half full I was looking for a great flight. We left on time and that was the only positive point. I started watching a movie and a young flight attendant approached and asked for my dinner choice. I told her that I would love a GT to start with and then I will read the menu. She told me that this was a late evening departure 9pm is not late for me and that no predinner drinks would be served. I insisted this is business class after all half full flight. 30 minutes later she brought a tray with everything on it GT first dish main dish and dessert. Never was I offered wine or coffee. The lights were turned off and I did not see a flight attendant until 130 hours before landing. Other passengers in business where treated the same and complained.
Davao to Singapore. I have had no problem with Silk Air until 6 October when I was returning from Davao. The trip was fine as normal however somehow my luggage one bag did not leave Davao airport in spite of checking in almost 32 hours before take off and seeing my bag complete with baggage stickers having been applied by check in staff and seeing the bag depart on the carousel. The non arrival of my bag at Auckland Airport caused me no end of distress as aside from clothing it contained my toiletries and important medication.
Blue Islands Airline has a poor Website and I could not check in online. No problem with British Airways EasyJet or Flybe. Phoned up Blue Island Customer services. Dreadful customer service just left waiting on hold. Only one carrier between Jersey and Guernsey so much for competition. The customer services representative told me to queue up at the airport for a boarding pass.
I have been a frequent traveler for 15 years and have flown every distance and cabin from first class to budget. Yet I have never been treated as badly as on todays Germanwings flight from Dusseldorf to Vienna. The purser was outright cruel.
I have flown several times this year on the Bacolod Manila route most recently in the last week of May. Delays are dreadful as they seem to be on other PAL Express routes. Some of the delays are due to congestion at Manila Airport but most are not. What makes a frustrating situation worse is the complete inability to keep passengers and those waiting to collect them informed. Check the airport information screens and they will likely say the departure time was two hours ago check the internet and there is no indication of any delay. Absolute rubbish. Once the plane takes off then the seating and service are fine for a budget airline.
Bangkok to Edinburgh via Doha. Impressive service from beginning to end. The new lounge at BKK is a huge improvement on the previously shared lounge with THAI. Every encounter with Qatar staff was professional and based on the highest level of training. The business class lounge at Doha is now busier than when it first opened as a result of which there is always a queue for a shower but thankfully it only takes about 1520 minutes to wait until one is freed up.
The departure was 955 pm from Chennai but it was almost 40 mins delay but no announcement no messages to the customer. Finally we boarded the tiny aircraft served small bottle of water at the time flight boarding. We never heard the safety instructions by the cabin crew before the flight. We departed around 1030 pm and after 1 hour of air journey we suddenly had a massive turbulence. After some time we got small announcement due to High wind bad weather conditions we have to wait some more time for landing. We landed safely finally in Hyderabad airport around 1240AM.
Zurich to Melbourne via Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific turns out there is a sting in the tail. I am heading out on a work trip and purchased a business class ticket because I knew that I might need to change flights due to meeting changes. 9th January 2018 I called to change my flight on the 17th January. I thought that this was a reasonable amount of time to change a business class ticket. I would have been disappointed but completely accepted if there were no tickets. What I was told was that there were not any seats available in my booking class. Not something that I had ever heard of before nor as you can imagine something that they promote when enticing you to buy their flexible ticket. Complete scam. They very kindly offered to 1. allow me to pay the difference to the different booking class what a scam 2. go on a wait list for this booking class Lots of other business class seats available on the flight but no chance that this is what they will do. I asked if I could speak with someone who could help me I had paid a lot of money after all so thought that this was unreasonable. I was told I could but that the answer would be the same. When I said that I would still like to I was then told that I actually couldnt because no one was there but i could wait on hold for up to 6 hours. I asked to go on the wait list and before I had pretty much finished saying the words I was hung up on. Not wanting to see if there was anything else I was needing already have my money and no need to try any harder. All I can say is that you got my money this time but never again. Lots of other airlines out there who actually care about their customers.
NBOMBA. ATR42 not exactly new but well kept. Courteous inflight staff genuine smiles. Some refreshment option of coffee or soda and poorly packed 4 biscuits. Overall experience okay and suitable for the no frills traveller especially for short haul. Always compare prices though because they are at times higher than those for the national carrier which operate bigger and much faster shuttles on the same route.
Flew from PHL to Cancun straight through trip. We were offered one drink for the 3 hours and 45 minute trip. The seats were very cramped and I had a seat directly in front of a bathroom lucky me with the smells and all coming from the very overused and unclean restroom. We hit turbulence and the pilot had the attendants in economy sit down. But I guess the attendant in first class was safe because she continued to serve those in first class. There were no TVs movies and the trip was long and hot at times. I would give them a no star rating. I will not fly US Airways again and from the looks of the other reviews I am not alone in this decision
Booked a spicejet from port blair to Chennai on 6th May. After checkin was done and making us wait for 2 hours flight was cancelled with a reason of operational issue. This cancellation happened after the flight was delayed 3 times. Spicejet is so horrible that they couldnt arrange us another flight or consider rebooking our connecting flights. I had my another flight booked from Chennai to Bangalore on the same day which I had to cancel without any refund and spicejet just said Sorry. Though spicejet gave accomodation which I never wanted this was a horrible and insensitive experience I had with spicejet.
Return flights from Luton to New York for 4 of us. Flight was cancelled with a flight rebooked to fly 12 hours later. We were advised a couple of weeks in advance so didnt cause any problems but a little irritating. Swift check in lounge at Luton was fine used it before as priority pass holders. The flight was excellent. Seats were comfortable and reclined although not full flat to be suitable to sleep. Pleasant staff who were attentive and discreet throughout. Champagne and very nice meal with choice of wines. Samsung Galaxy pads enabled viewing of limited films magazines etc. Dozed off and woken by staff offering refreshments. Newark arrival processes swift and easy. Return check in similar. Lounge busy but adequate seating with plenty of refreshments. As it was a night flight light meal okay but not exciting then went to sleep.. Although there appeared to be only 3 staff they were charming and efficient. Hugely impressed by La Compagnie. The flight both ways was a pleasure and would recommend and fly with them again.
Dubai to Kigali with Rwandair. The airline left 10 passenger bags in Dubai because the airline was over their weight limit. This doesnt make sense because the plane was only 60 full. When asked when my bags would arrive in Kigali the staff said they were unsure and this was normal. Im in Kigali for work and I had my business attire in my checked luggage. The customer service from checking in to landing was less than desirable. The plane was very dirty and had no been cleaned after the last flight. The flight attendant spoke was rude to some of the passengers. Im quite disappointed to learn the Rwanda Air frequently leaves passengers checked luggage at the originating airport to bring other cargo on the plane. Nor do they compensate you for lost or late luggage.
Male to Colombo. The customer service for such a high profile airline is beyond unacceptable. The cabin crew are not friendly. and treated us with no respect which i have never experienced in any other airline. I expected great service in the business class. I have recently flown qatar airways business class and the service was so amazing Emirates was such a disappointment.
When I had to exchange my ticket for later date and my new ticket was 250 cheaper Condor did not give me a credit or refund for airfare. They kept that amount and they still charged me 160 exchange fee. I had to exchange my ticket twice due to family issue and the 1st time they charged me 130 but the 2nd time 160. So whats their exchange fee really They do not have a set policy on fees and other things. Then their customer service rep booked my new ticket for 1 week earlier. It was his mistake. He was careless and didnt care about the customer. Overall I ended up canceling their ticket they kept the ticket price amount. I will never book them again.
Hong Kong to Beijing. The flight was to be delayed for one hour due to Beijing traffic control. We had boarded but staff served extra drinks etc. Great that the pilot made up some time so we arrived only about half an hour late. Service was good and the meal also good. And I had a good time preflight at the Cathay lounge for a quick shower as weather is hot already their best lounge in Hong Kong.
LHRTAS. My experience with this airline has been OK. They seem to keep to the flight times reasonably well at least out of Tashkent. There are some problems with the cabin crew using mobile phones during take off being one example. A real issue I have with them is the chaotic check in at LHR. The last two times at LHR the queue has filled one end of terminal 2 and takes 23 hours to get through. The flight is typically delayed by an hour because of this.
WindhoekCape Town Business. Good boarding perfectly on time. New A 319 with extremely comfortable Business seats 22 configuration new seats with plenty of rooms. Breakfast was good flight attendants very attentive and checking on the passengers. On time arrival. Cant get better than this flight and price was reasonable.
Flights on time. Cabin Crew is very attentive. I was lucky to fly back with same crew who keep same standard of care. They walk around and very initiative. The Cabin was clean although the aircraft was 14 years old. WiFi was acceptable however not working on return flight. You see how people on this airline working hard to improve their image. Food was above standard.
Newcastle to Bangkok via Dubai. I had a very favourable experience flying with Emirates. The cabin crew were hardworking and friendly planes clean and modern entertainment was top notch food high quality and you arent made to feel guilty for pressing the call button to ask for more drinks. The only negatives were the fact they ran out of the beef option on the Newcastle to Dubai leg and then the fact we departed Dubai almost an hour late although this was due to passengers not showing up and needing their baggage offloaded. I would recommend Emirates.
Kuala Lumpur to Geneva via Doha. Incredible service on both sectors. The crew gave their all to treat passengers as guests in their own home. Thats the only way to describe it. Pleasant attentive genuinely caring. Constantly bringing round drinks and offering extra snacks. The restrooms were kept spotless throughout. This airline recruits good people and trains them exceptionally well. Regional competitors dont even come close.
They wouldnt let us fly to Hawaii because our COVID test was 80 hours ago so we missed our flight. Bought 2 one way tickets on Alaska airlines which was great. Then when leaving on Hawaiian our flights had been canceled. After an hour fixing that we were seated next to a screaming kid. We asked for ear plugs and the FA said sure but never brought them. So for 5 hours we would doze off and be awoken by a screaming kid. My first trip to Hawaii ended as the worse day of my life.
The ground service was very smooth in Chennai. I was expecting a huge crowd at the check in counter but i finished my check in within 10 mins. They changed my seat number before boarding and upgraded my ticket to business class. The service was extremely good from Chennai to Bahrain. We had a transit time of 17 hours to Paris. They picked us from the airport and booked a room in a hotel. Provided lunch and breakfast and then dropped to airport. The flight to Paris was late by 50 mins. The service was comparatively not good. The temperature inside the aircraft was so chill they didnt provide extra blankets as well. The inflight entertainment is limited. Overall its value for money.
The flight was great I am impressed with the service on the aircraft. The cabin crews are more professional. As usual they could help me fill in the flight logs. However the sandwiches and salad provided this time is not good as usual this time. There were some chicken but with little lettuce or salad dressing. Hope to have some improvements on the meals. It would be better for the passengers to choose salads and desserts on their own not only the main meals.
We flew between Paris and Baku return. The service was excellent. The food hot lunch on the way to Baku and hot breakfast on the way back to Paris very good to excellent much better than on North American airlines. It was our first time on this airline and I would fly them again.
GCMMIA connecting to a intercontinental flight 7.20 am departure a very pleasant surprise as you walk to the plane 737300 a brand new livery the interior is fully refurnish standard configuration economy seat are very comfortable with lots of legroom 32 breakfast was served and a very pleasant and hard working cabin crew even manage to pass twice with a selection of complimentary beverages on a 75 minute flight this is unheard on most of the other airline even on longer flights.
My flight on on 12 May 2023 got delayed an hour and 25 minutes which resulted in the cancellation of our connection flight on 12 May 2023 as the arrival of the first flight was only 15 before the departure of the second connecting flight. We contacted the BA call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the 12th of May to KEF airport through different flights. The team tried to find a solution but none made sense not even on the next day the 13th of May 2023. We have made full booking of accommodation car rental activities etc for the vacation in Iceland. The cancellation of of these booking is not refundable. The call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight. British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all even though we paid additional 600 on new bookings and additional charges. The refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week. I was promised to get refund on the first call but later I found out it was not processed properly. Everytime I call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment. After multiple calls I was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level. I had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded. The whole experience was terrible.
The flight started badly in the so called new Concorde lounge at Dubai. I have reviewed this in the lounge section. The situation was worsened by a three hour delay to our departure. Apparently minimum rest period had been compromised. Not sure if this was true but we ended up with a 787 crew not a 777 crew. On the 777 the First seating is double that of a 787 and result was we were served the entire full cabin of 17 by one FA. He did his best but must have walked about 10 miles in the flight trying to keep us happy. The Boeing 777 first seat is the largest of the three options 747787747. Mine was starting to show signs of wear. No amuse bouche. As announced last month BA have cut back this cost. Wow a 3 saving on a 300o one way ticket. Well done BA. Champagne was lukewarm as is often the case. Lamb and fennel salad appetizer was ghastly. Horrible in fact. The soup was the usual Butternut squash soup do they offer anything else or am I unlucky and was lukewarm but okay. The apricot chicken was pleasant enough but I could not taste any apricot. A bistro product at best. Later in the flight I had afternoon tea sandwiches. All dry and tasteless. Watched a movie on the inflight entertainment system and this was fine. Nodded off and had two hour nap which was nice. Landed without being stacked for a change. As one comes to expect with BA underwhelming due to the bean counters at LHR cutting back as well as increasing fares. Id like to see the entire BA board removed and a new dynamic team of men and women with vision and inspiration for our national carrier.
Punta Cana to Brussels on hand luggage only ticket. Im not satisfied with their luggage policy and customer service on checkin counter. They charged me 30 for small cabin luggage which I wanted to checkin. The size and weight of luggage were correct 55x40x20cm10kg but they said that I have to pay for checkin. On my departure flight from Brussels to Punta Cana I checkedin my luggage without any problem no charge but on my way back staff at Punta Cana Airport took 30 and treated me with disrespect. I will never travel again with TUI
SYDNOU Economy A330. Wonderful flight and service especially compared to Qantas on the way back Great food. Lovely wine and digestif..
I think the overall service of the airline was excellent. The flight was a bit pricey especially since I had a 6 hour layover for a flight from Charleston to Fayetteville. I also think due to covid the plane should be boarded from the back to the front due to space of the airplane and deboarded from front to back.
Absolutely the worst experience ever. Flew into Heathrow no problem. Waited for 5 hours three extra hours for our connection to Porto then the cancelled the flight. Scrambled for a hotel and a new flight the next day. They routed us through Madrid the next morning. That flight was 1.5 hours late so we missed our connection to Porto. Because we missed the connection their fault they cancelled our return flights. After two hours on the phone with customer service from the Madrid airport they booked us a new return flight then they made is pay 1300 to fly from Madrid to Porto. Then for no reason they cancelled our return flight again After hours and hours and hours with customer service we finally got a return flight five days after our original return flight. Meanwhile they lost my wifes luggage. We finally got 15 DAYS after they lost it. Return flight More problems with our reservations. At no point was British Airways helpful. They left the onus on us to fix their mistakes at every turn. They completely ruined a three week vacation and they dont care. They wouldnt even let us speak to a supervisor or manager. Awful bordering on passenger abuse.
Aruba to Bonaire via Curacao. We booked in April 2017 for a flight Feb 22 2018. By chance I decided to look at the flight schedule 214 and found it had change our flight by 2 hours so we would not make the connection. I got Insel to change us but given the late arrive into BON would not get our hotel to get us. So I tried to cancel only to find they sent me a clause 9.2 CANCELLATION AND DELAYS 9.2.1 InselAir will take all necessary measures to avoid delay in carrying you and your baggage but times shown on timetables or elsewhere are not guaranteed and form no part of the agreement.

My wife and I used Ita airways service to fly to Italy. Unfortunately once arrived in Milan the nightmare with Ita Airways started one of our checked bags was lost. We went to denounce the loss and we found out that many other passengers that flew on our same flight had the same issue. After a very long time we were able to have the written documents of the loss and they told us in writing about what to do and who to contact in case we didnt received information about the lost luggage after 5 days. Well this is when the nightmare started we tried to call all the numbers that were available on the notice but no agent ever answered only a robot that for many days kept telling us that they were still looking for our luggage in the same time we tried to send also emails to the email address provided on the denounce document but we received right away the reply stating that the inbox was full and that nobody could read our email you can imagine our frustration we had some gift for the kids and my wifes clothes we kept calling but no answers and at this point 10 days of our vacation were gone after that the robot that used to answer stated that the luggage was been found and that was sent to Malpensa to the lost and found office.l I was super excited they found our luggage and when finally I was able to talk to a real agent this agent told me that the luggage was not there at that time my frustration came out and started complaining about the service I was receiving and and at that time the agent answered me I wasnt supposed to even answer your call and hung up. I dont know if I will ever find that luggage but I am sure of one thing I will never fly on ITA Airways again because I can accept that they can lose a luggage but I cant accept to be treated as we got treated no one deserves that treatment from a public company Customer Service.
Boston to Barcelona via London. I am a silver BA card holder and reserved two flights myself and my wife from Boston to London Heathrow in premium economy and Heathrow to Barcelona in Economy class. I paid for seat reservations for my wife on both legs as she has a bronze card and cannot reserve without paying. On check in at Boston we were given different seats for the Heathrow to Barcelona sector than I had reserved in the exit row due to a change of aircraft configuration. Although the booking was made months before no advance notice was given of the change. In early June I applied for a refund of the seat reservation cost and was given a case number. To date there has been no communication or refund from BA in spite of my sending a second email asking for information. Overall the service onboard and attention to customers has declined significantly over the past year due to cost cutting measures. We will not be flying transatlantic with BA in the future after 7 years of several crossings each year. In an article about British Airways in the Financial Times on 2nd June it said that their customers are less and less happy but due to increased earning from cost cutting the shareholders are very happy. Eventually they may learn that the loss of customers will be more important.
We flew from Vientiane to Pakse. The flight left and arrived on time. The plane was cramped beyond belief. Only one carryon bag fitted overhead. The other sat between us because it would not fit under the seat either. First time that has ever happened. Service was ok but the whole cabin was incredibly small and on a full flight which ours was that meant uncomfortable. If I ever fly this airline again Ill check that I am not flying on an MA60.
Jakarta to Taipei. The flight was supposed to depart at 1410 from Jakarta to Taipei but it was delayed for 1 hour 40 minutes due to technical problem. No reconciliation provided by the airline for this delay to the passengers. Our first time to fly China Airlines and disappointing. They shall not fly problematic aircraft unless that is all they can afford. Will not fly China Airlines anymore.
Disappointing again especially on business. The service is ancient one world lounges are a catastrophe at Heathrow. Business class seat is similar to economy and electronics are very poor onboard.
Congratulations to Jet2 on how they have dealt with customers during the pandemic. Had a flight to Malaga booked for June 2020 and obviously this was a non starter. They sent an email with options 1. Move the flight 2. Take a credit 3. Do nothing and money will be refunded. For a number of reasons option 3 worked best for us. Jet2 had the money refunded within 10 days. Big Thumbs up.
Chiang Mai to Bangkok flight PG228 onboard an older Airbus A319. Flight was slightly delayed due to the late incoming aircraft. The lounge at Chiang Mai airport was fairly basic sandwiches juices and a popcorn machine but definitely set the airline aside from its competitors. The aircraft interior was starting to show its age seats were wide and spacious yet the appearance was subpar even to low cost carriers such as AirAsia. Flight was approximately at 90 capacity with some empty middle seats. Cabin crew were professional and enthusiastic from boarding to disembarking. A full meal was distributed yet left a lot to be desired. Metal cutlery was provided definitely a nice touch as some other full service carriers dont provide them. Touched down in Bangkok 5 minutes later than scheduled and ferried by bus back to the terminal. Bags were a little slower to arrive due to the far proximity of the area from where the aircraft was parked upon arrival. Overall for the price I paid for this flight 40USD I had an enjoyable experience and I wouldnt hesitate to use them again.
Terrible customer service you cant actually speak to a human their autobot replies come weeks after you make an inquiry after going back forth for 8 weeks Im not entitled to any cost reimbursement for our trip despite paying for the additional medical or baggage insurance. Also our return flight was delayed. I was traveling for business while my family was tagging along for a vacation. I thought this would be low cost option however by the time you pay for all the fees dont forget to pay for your seat selection so your arent separated from your child as stated right on their booking website and ALL baggage carry on included it works out to be the same or more than flying with a real airline. Lesson learned however it meant getting the times required so I figured lesson learned. Next I paid for Swoops extra baggage cancellation insurance provided by CHUBB Insurance Brokers just in case. Prior to leaving our one family member fell ill and was subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer. To accommodate specialist appointments our travel dates changed and the affected family member was no longer going to join the trip I couldnt simply modify the booking but was advised by the customer service department for the CHUBB Insurance Swoops bot directed me here to rebook the flights for the new dates submit for reimbursement to their claims department after we returned. However you cannot simply book for only those going but rather for the entire party even when 1 passenger is no longer going on the trip. At flight check in time we had to advise the boarding desk of the 1 passenger not joining should be a simple task however take off was still delayed both ways as the check in desk didnt inform the flight crew so they were trying to track down the missing passenger. All on board purchases were very expensive must be paid for by credit card. The plane itself was very small seats felt cheap uncomfortable. The onboard wifi was choppy and kept cutting out and the cabin crew were very rude. On return departure a ground crew member was complaining loud enough that us other passengers could hear how annoyed they were at having to help a passenger onto the plane that was in a wheelchair I have flown other budget airlines before and found their service planes much better. So since nothing flight change fee new flights for all 4 passengers even though only 3 were traveling additional insurance was reimbursed even though I paid extra for this optional insurance I am now out 3348.17 plus the costs of the multiple physician notes the insurance adjusters kept requiring had to send in 4 different notes over the course of the 8 week claim battle. This company and its optional insurance is a joke. Way to take peoples money for nothing. I am hoping to save someone else their hard earned money.
Istanbul to Montreal. The boarding process was interesting. Firstly you cannot do online checkin as they need to check your passport. After going through airport security twice when you go to the gate you go through another security check. After that some people were sitting behind the boarding desk while we were waiting for the plane as there werent enough seats and the crew was pretty pissed about it even though they initially didnt say anything about them being there. Once boarded everything was smooth again. I love the new Turkish inflight safety video. There were a couple of new movies that I watched on the IFE system. They still have random episodes of TV Series which is interesting. The food was better than usual with ground beef stuffed eggplant rice and tzatziki sauce. The second meal they served Mac and Cheese was alright as well. I usually like Turkishs food but this time I was actually impressed as they somehow outdid themselves. We departed slightly late but landed almost 20 minutes early which was the cherry on top.
It was my first time traveling with Turkish Airlines. I got to Cameroon on December 24th my luggage arrived on December 29th. I went back on January 12th same scenario I still dont have my luggage. There is nobody to assist me. I called their customer service and an agent told me that one of my luggage has arrived that I could go pick it up. I drove 45 min to the airport to notice that nothing ever arrived. I called them once there the new agent I spoke to told me that my luggage are still in transit. No compassion no empathy no apologies. Why do I have to undergo all this with no explanations on why my luggage are being delayed I cant ever recommend this airline it is worse than Spirit Airlines.
The worst Airline in terms of customer service and handling of customers money. My Wife and kids were supposed to fly in Srilankan Airlines on 09052020 and to return back on 02102020. And I was meant to fly on 29th Aug and bring my family back on 02102020. Due to Covid19 May flights got cancelled as a result airline promised to refund the fares. I requested to cancel my August ticket without any compensation as there is no requirement for me to fly if my family did not fly in May. Firstly they said they cannot give a full refund for the August flight as the flight is still on. However no consideration given to the fact that all 4 tickets were booked together and paid as one transaction. Secondly today is 20082020 every time I contact them they say that they will refund asap However it is been 3 and a half months and SriLankan Airlines still holding on to my 4000 for the tickets. Very disappointing as they are keeping my money for a service that they have not provided to me. Only reason i used SriLankan Airlines over the last 3 years is that they had a direct flight from Melbourne to Colombo and it is convenient to use them as a family as there is no transit. However the inflight service is very poor. Business Class is OK but nothing to be excited about.
The experience was very good on both Outbound to Inbound flights. As we travelled Premium Economy we received priority boarding which was good especially as we were travelling with my 80 year old dad. Premium Economy is very good especially the Leg room which is the main reason I wanted it and being over double some economy fares it satisfied our needs. Extra recline also made a difference and was bearable even when the person in front was reclining. The Premium Economy cabin only has 4 rows 242 and is separated from the main economy cabin which made it feel more spacious. We chose the back row so nobody behind us made it feel a little more private and a big gap between us and exit room economy in the next cabin. Flight was smooth and comfortable Staff were great. Helpful and very accommodating when needed. Food was good although had the option to Book the Cook prior to flight. I know some airlines are starting to increase leg room to 40 inches SIN 38 which would be great when you consider the extra money that is paid. On our return from Croatia at Frankfurt there were flight delays which meant we would miss our connection from SIN MEL But both Lufthansa an Singapore Airlines made this a much less stressful experience in fact a great little adventure. At FRA we received meal vouchers and were updated regularly by helpful staff and when we arrived in SIN everything was organised as soon as we got of the plane. Meal vouchers hotel vouchers Taxi to hotel and back assistance with getting our entry visa on arrival. Choose a good airline and the combo of Lufthansa and especially flying major legs with Singapore Airlines made it an easy comfortable experience. I would highly recommend.
Delhi to Singapore. Smooth check in at New Delhi airport where they do also weigh your hand carry something I did not see at Changi. Boarding procedures were seamless. The dated seat on the 772 was quite comfortable although there was no USB port to charge smartphones. Beautiful celebratory wreaths decorated the cabin walls. Singapore Airlines give big fluffy pillows and blankets in economy class. You can select newspapers and headphones while boarding. Hot towels and menus were served. Singapore Airlines service standards are stellar. IFE on board differed on the 777 and A380. Screens unfortunately were not that clear or clean on both aircraft. The vegetarian oriental meals I ordered on both flights were super. Crew provide refreshments and the cabin presence on board was beyond any other airline in economy class I have flown.
Flew New York JFK to Brussels via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines was great definitely recommend. The food was very good for economy class I ordered vegetarian meals which are almost always bland and generally awful but I had no complaints. They seemed rather sophisticated and quite tasty for airline food and you actually eat with real metal utensils. The seats were comfortable enough probably the most average portion of the flight and my transatlantic flight had TVs as expected for a 1011 hr flight with good selection and my shorter flight 4 hrs had overhead TVs that were available for everyone to watch. Best part of Turkish though is that they really do take care of you. On my transatlantic voyage they provided a package with slippersblanketsleep maskheadphonestoothbrush and more. The bathrooms had real flowers in them and they came around many times with food and drink first with Turkish Delight then with a different cake then with dinner then coffeetea then breakfast then coffeetea a second time. Overall great experience. Clean comfortable planes really good prices quite good food and it seems a genuine care for passengers.
Bangkok to Udon Thani. Fast checkin at Don Mueang airport in BKK flight on time enough space for hand luggage friendly staff seat ok short flight. No complaints whatsoever
Slow response of the staff and no one at Frankfurt airport in the customer service office. I have a connecting flight from AMS and it was very tight in time. In the end I missed my flight and luggage. Dont really recommend it
I am very happy with the service and care provided during this trip. They also upgraded to Business class from Wellington to Melbourne. It was like a sweet and short trip. Thanks for this. Also changed my Bangalore ticket to a earlier flight saving me almost 18 hrs with a very nominal fees. I am very much obliged and grateful for this service. Singapore Airlines have earned a loyal customer today.
Booked a flight for 12.10.2020 and today a day before I receive the cancellation of the flight. This year it has happened to me multiple times and I had to spend a fortune on buying new tickets to finally fly away. None of the Airlines I used ever refunded money so far and today I am in the same situation again when none of the airline reps can clearly explain what is going on How long this is going to continue Covid is the reason Are we going to use it as an excuse everytime and everywhere How come that overnight everything so of a sudden changes today is safe tomorrow is dangerous presumably according to the logic of the airlines Why if its so you simply don t sell tickets and dont fool people into spending their hard earned money into something that is not guaranteed If you cannot refund straight away and its a shame that 6 months wasnt enough for you to come up with some kind of solution for this then I believe your reputation and customers is not what you value Of course I can make it my last flight this year or even next. I think its time for some changes from the customers side This is ridiculous.
My wife had a very small hand bag we had to pay for that 60 euros so I gave the lady cash and she answered that they don t accept cash so i told her what if i dont have a credit card She answered me Sir you can complain at Aegean airline or airport in a rude way. When we arrived to our destination they broke our luggage.
Took a flight from Belgrade to Athens which was fairly empty. Friendly ish crew who brought a seemingly never ending supply of drinks plus a snack comprising a niceenough sandwich and a delicious chocolate croissant. All on time.
Air crew service overall was fine just only an air stewardess a bit grumpy and judgmental not happily help customer arrange cabin baggage. The diabetic meal option serves the same food which i dont mind the food quality overall is good. The air ventilation is ok and the toilets are replenished with tissue papers. I think the economy class seats space are alright. The check in timings are quite on time just long queue at Istanbul airport. Could have served mineral water more frequently for passengers.
I returned from JFK last Friday morning reasonable flight although delayed for an hour and a half. Main meal was okay but the breakfast was appalling a stale croissant with some jam. I paid good money for this flight. Really disappointed quality is slipping away.
Flew back from Dublin on 8th October 2014 to Cambridge. First time Ive used Cityjet and was really impressed. Excellent service very friendly and helpful stewardess. Fokker 50 was very pleasant to fly in. Arrived bang on time in Cambridge and was out the airport and in a taxi in 10 minutes brilliant.
Excellent service levels proactive crew and superb food and beverages. I found all aspects of the service to be superior to BA business class even the new BA Club Suites. First Class felt exclusive the dedicated crew were clearly used to working the premium cabin enjoying their work were proactive friendly very respectful and the food and beverage offering a considerable step up from business class. The seat with sliding double doors was spacious well designed and very comfortable. British Airways offered a solid First Class service from Concorde Lounge to boarding which was actually by group number for a change to the very warm and genuine welcome on boarding. A consistent solid comfortable service from start to finish and if the price was right I would not hesitate to book First Class with British Airways again.
The flight wasnt bad but the airline lost my luggage and is unable to determine where my luggage is. The luggage search runs through an external company Swissport who also have no contact person. So nobody can say where my luggage is. The airline does not have a counter at New Zealand airports. The only way is to use an online form to indicate that you have lost your luggage. Whats the point if I get from A to B but my luggage just disappears like that and above all Im helpless because I cant make contact.
Copenhagen to Doha in Business Class on a Boeing 7879. Qatar Airways lived up to its reputation as the finest Business Class product. On this 7879 the seats were the older type not the Qsuite but very comfortable nevertheless. Onboard service was flawless. Qatar serves meals on demand in Business Class. If there is one point of criticism it is that the food served could do with more attention to both the quality and care in preparation. WiFi worked very well throughout the flight. All in all a relaxing comfortable flight.
Mumbai to Amsterdam. Worst airline ever. I flight to Delhi on April 6th plane was dirty old food basic. No entertaiment on board. What is more on the way back the flight was cancelled and I needed to wait in Mumbai for two days. Now it is not possible to get any refund from the airline as the ticket was bought via company in Europe. If they ever start to operate again do not buy tickets from that airline.
Flew Sydney to Coffs Harbour return on Q400. Crew were friendly and attentive plane in good condition flight left Sydney on time. Would fly them again.
Had booked back 2021 to fly from Manchester to New York via Dublin in September of that year Aer Lingus then cancelled the flight from Manchester to Dublin and we changed to the direct service that was due to start in November 2021 which was also later cancelled. We opted for a refund and after hundreds of emails and phone calls I have still not had a refund 18 months later. This airline is useless and will never fly with them again
7 weeks out from our flight we attempted to make a change to one persons ticket for our familygroup of five tickets. At this time changes to the ticket were at no cost. However for more than four weeks we were told that the last leg of the journey was unconfirmed as it was a third party airline. We must deal with them ourselves. This third party airline says it was booked through share agreement with Turkish Airlines and they must confirm. No single phonecall centre operator could help us. Of course as we escalated the issue to become urgent with emails to the head office they can of course change the ticket but now the last leg of the journey will cost an additional 1489 AUD with a ticket that already cost us 3500 return Brisbane to Croatia via Istanbul return. We could of course cancel and get a return flight home for the same cost as the additional flight price but they informed us that if we were to cancel the entire flight both outbound and inbound would be cancelled with no refund. We spoke to the call centre without luck head office which rerouted to the call centre and also customer service in additional to multiple emails and many supposed recorded calls. There is some language barrier however I think most errors are also with the customer service systems.
Singapore to London. They wanted to charge me an extra GBP65 for being over the 23kg limit. The legroom seemed very small to me the flight was super full and I was sitting next to a big woman who spilled over her side of the seat. I was asked if I would like tea or coffee with my breakfast and the steward said he will come back with the tea. After a long time I managed to catch the same guy walking by and asked him for my tea and he just said that there was no tea.
Boeing 777300ER A6EBL was very difficult 5.5 hours from Dubai to Hanoi. The seats are very narrow and leg room is nonexistent especially if the person in front of you decides to recline the seat. Furthermore there is a box of equipment under the front seat further reducing room for your feet so you cant even stretch your legs as the comfort video tells you to. I know Emirates have a few configurations for the 777 it seems they put the condensed seats on the Asian routes profiling the average body size of the passengers. Very disappointing for Emirates. IFE is standard Emirates with many movies and options but on a very small and badly lit screen old fashioned equipment. On the positive side wifi was great and much faster than the A380.
My family and I have been Jet Blue customers for years and I am wanting to simply change a flight not looking for a refund or a credit of any sort. The original flight that was booked was MORE expensive than the flight I am looking to change to. However Jet Blue is wanting to charge twice the amount with all of its fees. I am very disappointed in how customer service treats its customers and will think twice about booking with your airline in the future.
Bangalore to London via Kuwait. Having read poor reviews I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and comfort of the planes and the good service. Both flights were punctual enough and baggage delivery was speedy. Almost my best experience of flight from India to a hub airport.
Darwin to Brisbane. Was hesitant about flying with them but given how cheap the tickets were I decided to give them a go. Overall couldnt fault them. We left on time landed early and had no dramas despite it being a full flight. Service was what I expected courteous and polite. I am a larger person so the seats felt fairly tight but I expected this and it wasnt too bad. There was no wifi or onboard entertainment but I had my own iPad and had downloaded movies for the trip so didnt mind. Would I fly with them again absolutely especially with how cheap they were compared to other carriers.
Very happy with my trip I flew from Bangkok to Mandalay on Christmas day. Flight was on time. Staff were polite and the aircraft was clean. The service is much better than I was expecting snacks free luggage given the price and how bad and expensive low cost European flights have become. I would definitely recommend flying Myanmar National Airlines.
MidNovember the outward journey AMS BKK in the Boeing 787 dream liner to my surprise very little legroom not to say very tight in row 21 but I was lucky row 20 with a lot of legroom you looked at the pantry among other things 2 empty seats. Consultation with a flight attendant and I was very spacious on row 20B stretching my legs etc. The return flight BKKAMS was a true torture for me and others so little legroom I was now in row 28C soon here and there some irritation and sometimes a fight especially if someone pushed their seat back a bit by the way a seat like C is not really nice people constantly bump into you including staff The passenger in front of me moved his seat back a bit so I monitor was about 10 cm away. So I leaned back a little to which a passenger behind me started grumbling I didnt want any problems so I stood up and patiently explained to the man dont complain to me but do it at EVA or fly premium ok that problem solved quickly. My thought apparently due to the new seat configuration EVA still wanted to cash in Half November de heenreis AMS BKK in de Boeing 787 dream liner tot mijn verbazing zeer weinig beenruimte om niet te zeggen zeer krap op rij 21 echter ik had geluk rij 20 met heel veel beenruimte je keek oa tegen de pantry aan 2 lege stoelen. Ff overleggen met een stewardess en ik zat op 20B zeer ruim benen strekken enz. De terugvlucht BKKAMS was voor mij en anderen een ware marteling zo weinig beenruimte ik zat nu op rij 28C al snel hier en daar wat irritatie en soms ruzie met name als iemand zijn stoel wat naar achteren deed by the way een stoel als C is ook niet echt lekker constant botsen mensen tegen je aan incl. personeel De passagier voor mij deed zijn stoel wat naar achter waardoor ik mijn monitor op ong.10 cm afstand kwam. Dus ik ook maar iets naar achter waarop een passagier achter mij begon te mopperen ik wilde geen problemen dus ben gaan staan en de man geduldig uitgelegd ga niet bij mij klagen maar doe dat bij EVA of vlieg premium ok dat probleem snel opgelost. Mijn gedachte blijkbaar door de nieuwe stoelen configuratie wilde EVA nog ff cashen
ZAGDBV. Lost their afternoon flight but was rebooked on the evening flight at no extra cost and easily. For a flight of 45 minutes they managed to serve a bottle of water and a cookie with a smile which was highly appreciated. Their A320 was clean with enough space and comfortable seats. The flight had some turbulence but this was dealt with high professionalism from cabin crew. Departed and arrived on schedule. Very impressed with their service.
Singapore to Seoul. Flight arrived either early or on time. However I had selected my seats for both legs immediately after I bought the tickets online via Korean Air website. On both legs our seats were assigned to worse options. The SingaporeSeoul leg we were given seats further back on the aircraft. I chose front rows as we didnt have check in luggage and therefore could clear the airport quicker. The SeoulSingapore leg not only were our seats reassigned but we were separated. At the check in counter at the airport the clerk managed to get us two seats together. However we were wedged between two other passengers making it a tight squeeze. I had selected two seats together the aircraft to Seoul had better seat configuration and leg space. While they had 3 options to choose from the food on both legs was below par. Even low cost carriers give better quality food.
I took advantage of the low fare that Hawaiian Airlines offered and then they treat me like the low class that the ticket represents. I had to check my own bags but I couldnt select my own seat. No one is available to help you check your bags because all the agents are standing at the boarding gate and sorting out the seating arrangement for the low budget flyers ... and thats how they assign their staff time. You then board in group 6 and scrap for baggage space in the overhead bins. You get what you pay for and you are treated like it too. Only positive of the trip was the movie selection after you pay 4 for earbuds.
k to Melbourne via Hong Kong. Never flown this far before so decided to go Business Class. What a joy this was. From the time we boarded at Gatwick we were made to feel very special. When my husband had a problem with his on board entertainment monitor the technician was on it immediately. Unfortunately it could not be fixed. The cabin manager was very apologetic. She then issued 100 U.S. as compensation in Cathay Pacific vouchers. On changing in Hong Kong all went well. Food and service excellent. Punctuality spot on. Would definitely fly with them again All the equipment worked on the return flights and connections seamless. I use a wheelchair in airports and stations. This worked extremely well. Return journey was seamless and punctual. We agreed to swap seats with a family who we we separated due a last minute change of aircraft we thought nothing of this. The new seats suited us better. At the end of the journey we were presented with a complimentary box of chocolates. A really nice gesture.
Calgary to Cancun. Extremely dissatisfied with Air Transat regarding their integrity lack there of. Flew from Calgary to Cancun checkedin one suitcase. When awaiting my baggage in Cancun it took a substantial amount of time for the bag to come on the belt. When I finally retrieved my suitcase I found the lock broken and items stolen from my bag. I immediately contacted the airline and was told to wait at least 6 weeks for a response. I received a letter back apologizing but said I need to work with my travel insurance company for any liability as stolen items are not covered by the airline. I left my luggage in the care of the airline and this is what happens. Im very disappointed in the lack of resolution and lack of seriousness from the airline.
Frankfurt to Buenos Aires via London in October 2019. The aircraft is very old with small screens and ample entertainment which becomes an issue flying 10hrs. The 1 hour layover was a complete disaster. The staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me.
Manila to Puerto Galera. They cancelled the flights 4 days prior to departure and despite my several requests I have never been refunded. Do not fly with this company.
We traveled as a family from US to India and back. I have to acknowledge that we had a pleasant trip both ways. The customer care was beyond excellent and the cabin crew were the most respectful and friendly staff we have ever met in all these years of our air travel. The food was absolutely incredible and the choices were simply amazing. The Hamad international airport is simply awesome and the best we have ever seen We did not even feel that we had a 15 hour flight it was that comfortable and relaxing The one minus point was the crammed aircrafts from US to Doha and Doha to India Boeing 777300ER. It was very congested and crowded.
Brussels to Male via Dubai. A couple of years ago business class of Emirates and Qatar were similar but Emirates is sliding down a bit while my experience with Qatar Airways is always top. This time both flights were really not okay Crew showed no or little interest in you and was chatting in the galley before cabin staff introduced herself to each passenger not anymore ICE system not working properly finally this was solved by a stewardess. Food not bad but average no hot towels before takeoff no amenity kit anymore new business class with 3 middle seats is strange choice and claustrophobic certainly middele seat. Second flight in an a bit outdated an not so clean 777 badly organised priority boarding for business in fact almost none in DXB.
Our experience was nothing short of exceptional. What stood out to us the most was the professionalism and courtesy displayed by the flight attendants. Their service was attentive and they were ready to assist with a smile. The onboard amenities were impressive from ample legroom and comfortable seats to the variety of inflight entertainment options which kept us entertained throughout the flight.
Osaka to Shanghai. They canceled our flight two times without provide any acommodation or food. Last time they just gave us the chance of refund money and the worst thing is the money will be in two months Finally we had to buy tickets two times more expensive in another company plus 5 days lost on our holiday. Customer sevice is one of the worst I have seen.
London Heathrow to Kos return. Outbound the Galleries South lounge looking shabby. Onboard cramped seats 2DF disinterested cabin crew and appalling breakfast. Return there no lounge at Kos airport slow busing to plane attentive crew and good lunch. Both flights on schedule and baggage return reasonably quick. A case of two halves but the new British Airways Club Europe is poor value.
Horrible experience flight was scheduled at night 2100 received notification in the afternoon that flight is rescheduled to 2200 hrs and again received notification by evening that flight is again rescheduled to 2300 hrs. After check in Goa Airport again further flight is rescheduled to 0000 hrs. First time I am traveling in SpiceJet and it is worst
I am extremely impressed with the business class product on this international flight. The airplane has been in service for 24 years but extremely wellkept. We had an hour delay due to a technical issue with one of the navigation instruments however Air France allowed us to stay in the terminal and not on the plane something that I extremely appreciate. I was very disappointed however with fellow business class passengers for giving the crew a hard time because we were late due to the fact that they were trying to fix one of the navigational instruments. Really You get upset because the delay is a safety issue that they are trying to fix before we take off on a 9 hour flight Thank you Air France for ensuring that safety came first. I would have gladly waited as long as I had to Once up in the air the business class service was nothing short of stellar the meals were all gourmet by a three star Michelin Chef the inflight crew was warm welcoming personable and genuine. I have to say that after this experience the business class product on Air France for me comes in at number 2. Qatar obviously still holds the 1st place for me. This airplane had been upgraded to the new business class configurations 121. I had a window seat 7A and even though overall I am not a big fan of the new business class pods industry wide the seat was very comfortable with plenty of storage and the entertainment options were very good. Amenity kit headphones a very nice pillow and duvet were also offered in business class. One thing I loved about Air France is that they give you free WiFi to send text messages via WhatsApp Messenger iMessage and a few other messaging platforms so you really do not need to purchase an Internet package unless you want to stream. The Internet on this flight worked from gate to gate without interruption of service. Overall next time I go to Europe I will most definitely have Air France on my top list. They are offering a business class product that the rest of their competitors in this market are not. Merci Air France for a safe and wonderful experience onboard Im a fan
The in flight staff was not attentive at all. Requested mango juice as part of lunch never arrived. The attendant never came to offer me snacks or drinks. Paid 1200 for a economy ticket but received a below average service from this staff. Its their responsibility to attend every customer during the flight they failed badly with me.
Singapore to Venice via Dubai. As a regular of Qatar and Etihad on the SingaporeEurope route this was my first time with Emirates. I would not call it a total disappointment but the company is definitely and sadly not worth its fame. Positive aspects new aircrafts comfortable Economy seats with decent pitch nice food plus points for the metal cutlery efficient ground staff. Seat selection is not complimentary and the cost disproportionate the cheapest option for each of the 4 legs of my journey would have increased the ticket price by around 17 Cabin service is close to nofrill airlines no hot towel no amenity kit no staff walking around the aisle with trays of drinks during sleeping hours. The inflight entertainment on the A380 was a quite unresponsive touch screen with cursor. Charging plugs are only available to window and central seat. Worse part the staff. I was told that an increasing number of Europeans had joined Emirates from Ryanair and I was displeased to see the same attitude brought to the 4star airline. Apart from the lack of smiles and rough replies to some passengers that I could hear the staff onboard the SINDXB night flight had been talking and laughing loudly in the galley for at least one hour after the light were switched off going in and out without caring to seal the courtains. I have not seen such behaviour even on cheap lowcost carriers like Scoot or AirAsia where the staff at least excercises the basic courtesy of letting their passengers sleep. With prices that are in line with its competitors in the region I do not see the reason for me to fly Emirates again.
Flew Dubai to Manchester 19102019 on an A380. Having travelled with Emirates in the past I paid the holiday company a premium to travel with them again. I wish I had never bothered. The service was a farce. The cabin staff were like headless chickens. It was as if they had never set foot in an airplane before. They appeared poorly trained and badly managed.
Geneva to Vancouver via London. Worst experience. Terrible service and when we wrote with constructive criticism they offered 25 voucher and no apology an insult as did not ask for compensation. Its an expensive price to pay for a low cost airline. On a positive point the Geneva to London flights were fine but the 2 long haul flights to Vancouver were abysmal.
We wanted web checkin. On app as well as website we couldnt make it. All numbers given on ticket were switched off. I had to rush to Rajkot airport to have a web checkin I sought on mail information on RTPCR test. The autoreply said Will get back to you within 3 working days. Who waits for three days to get an answer to such small issue The airline staff of Bagdogra also badly handled my bag and broke the belts and wheels out of one bag.
What a welcome surprise fastjet is giving real competition to Kenya Airways whose fares are significantly higher. For about 80 less we flew them from Lilongwe Malawi to Dar es Salaam. They departed and arrived on time. The plane was new and comfortable. Yes they charge for additional services but the customer has control of how much beyond the very low fare they want to spend for advance booking more advantageous seating baggage and food. Even with all the extras our fare remained very low.
LomeAbidjan Business Class. I flew this short 60 min flight from Lome Togo to Abidjan Ivory Coast. The transit time at this small airport was approximately 1 hour. Boarding went smoothly. The bus dropped us of at the stairs approximately 100m from the gate. My seat was 1D on a Boeing 737 New Generation. All business class seats were configured 2x2 and were all leather. Announcements were made and manual safety instructions shown. Take off was smooth. At cruising level the cabin service started and a warm meal was offered. Soon after tables where cleared and cabin prepared for landing. All in all a very pleasant experience.
Brisbane to London return. Both flights the air crew and ground staff were great. Food was pretty good both trips and enough choices for entertainment including a number of recent movies although would be pressed to have enough movies to do two London trips in the same month. At the price point I think China Airways offers a great product and Taipei airport is big enough to happily spend time during transit. Point to note duty free shopping is not a bargain.
Our flight time was changed from 08.50am to 6pm I missed all connecting flights had to pay for another hotel in Abuja and was stuck in limbo. I had already checked out of the hotel. The flight change wasnt communicated and we only discovered when we got to the airport.
Bangkok to London via Paris in Business Class 4th April. Sad to say it was the worst long haul business class flight Ive had. Plus points On time relatively inexpensive 1450. LHRBKKLHR outward with KLM via AMS which was much much better. Minus point Cabin service Perfunctory offhand going through the motions just about. This was a daytime flight but the shutters were battened down for more than 9 hours of a 12 hour flight. Patronisingly like I was a 7 year old I was told that passengers like to sleep monsieur. So I checked the cabin and less than 20 were. Lazy inattentive cabin crew they could do less work less if they kept the punters bedded down for as long as possible. Food Dreadful. Just about OK for economy class unacceptable for a business class. But at least the champagne was warm. A lamb dish that couldnt have been more overcooked. The rest was completely uninspiring. A self service buffet that any selfrespecting airline should have been embarrassed to offer even in economy. Narrow seat but just about OK for sitting up in but uncomfortable as a bed angled rather than lieflat. Verdict The worst business class flight Ive ever had. Ill never fly Air France by choice again. I would have had better value in Premium Economy with a proper airline. The quality of the cabin crew has a lot to do with whether you have a good flight or not. This lot would have been better working on a bus. The one exception was the female cabin attendant who at least made eye contact and smiled with some sincerity. Air France Remember you have competition.
This was me and my wife traveled with Virgin Australia. We spent 760 on tickets and took us 6 hours to Perth and no one ask us for a glass of water. We have to call a staff for a glass of water and one of the rudest staff Ive ever seen. I dont recommend this airline to anyone. Wifi signs are displayed but there was no network. You can imagine sitting for 6 hours no water how hard it will be. Will never ever using this airline in my life.
Hong Kong to London in World. It was on the A380 first time aboard and must say I was impressed. A much better experience than the Emirates A380. Great mood lighting large windows. Nice to have a number of small cabins on both decks. Friendly service from the crew.
Goa to Chandigarh. All people are saying the flights are cancelled but we dont receive any massages from airlines the flight was cancelled so what we do we need to go tomorrow or not. We are calling our agent who booked our flights he says that your flight are going but all people says its not going. And also trying to context with GoAir helpline number but they dont receive our call.
Douala to Accra via Lome. No real problems at check in just had to pay a little for excess baggage which was mercifully cheap. The only problem was finding the departure gate which was right at the end of the right arm. It looked closed until you navigated round a few doors. The flight left a little early. The aircraft for this leg into Lome was a new Q400. Basic snack was provided on what was a short flight. Lome was chaos the airport is just not big enough to act as any sort of hub as it does for ASKY. So I only just made the connecting flight after all the queues. This time a new 737 for the 20 minute hop down to Accra. Again no problems with this leg. Overall a pretty good experience they just need to sort out Lome. There is some construction work going on nearby so maybe that will be resolved.
I am very disappointed in the way Ive been treated by flight attendants on flight 305 on April 4th 2023. I am not the smallest girl nor am I the largest but I will say I do fit in my seat well but the other two passengers next to me are a little bigger so it doesnt allow me to sit in my seat all the way and I am pushed to the edge of my seat closest to the isle my arm is kind of over the armrest where if someone is larger sized walking by they will bump into me. However the flight attendants on this flight seem to be fit and are not overweight at all which is mind boggling to me because neither one of them walking by that pushed bumped or ran into my arm with the cart are overweight or obese so in my mind theres no reason why they should be bumping me in the aggressive way they have been this whole flight so far. Neither of them apologized or even acknowledged me when they did bump into me I find it very unprofessional and unpleasant and I dont plan on flying with Alaska again after this experience. Even someone on the plane twice the size of Gail turned to where she wasnt bumping into me. And if that doesnt prove that these terrible flight attendants have no respect or self awareness then I dont know what does. All of these flight attendants need some more training on being professional and being considerate of others.
We tried to make a return reservation from JerseyZurich. The return schedule was not available so the Blue Islands staff person on the phone advised us to book the outbound and the return separately when the schedule was available. This we did. Because we booked the return from Zurich as a separate flight on the advice of Blue Islands staff we have been charged the return fare in Swiss Francs. The difference is approximately L200. We have written and faxed Blue Islands but they do not reply.
Pristina to Islamabad via Istanbul. Worst experience ever with the ground staff. They are rude. And have no desire to help out. I arrived and asked for a meal voucher. To which the lady said. No working. Come later. I asked why and how much later. And she started to show irritation and anger. So I asked her why she was raising her voice. And she said. I get angry at you because you dont understand. This electricity issue and not personal. I even asked why they dont have a manual process for this. And she told me to go away
Flew British Airways from Boston to London Heathrow. The plane was clearly dated judging by the old IFE screens and even some rust here and there but the plane was clean the crew were extremely nice and polite. The food was good although I would say the light meal just before arrival could have been a bit more substantial. Overall it was a nice flight. A note on the ground service the way it is set up with a line for bag drop among others and multiple counters that can call for this and that spread out leads to some people not hearing being called. I could clearly hear the staff annoyingly saying I have called them and they are not listening so I am not doing it anymore. I really think it is not nice given the distance between the counters and the lines and the natural noise on an airport terminal.
Prague to Tel Aviv. Horrible service. Provided them wil all the security details needed including place of work cards IDs certifications and they still had us investigated as if we were terrorists. They came back with new questions all the time and still after all questioning was done we had to wait and wait for too long. Our bags were opened and our dirty clothes and shoes were put took out of their bags and put on the clean ones. Worst flight ever. A nightmare
Dusseldorf to Paris CDG return on Embraer E190 jets. The plane was very clean 2x2 configuration as standard with extremely wide seats. I am 63 188cm on 180 pounds and the seats were wide and long enough for my legs. There was enough leg space including space for luggage below the seat. Some people had trouble finding space for their luggage overhead but that is a problem on regional jets. Shortly after takeoff the first round of drinks was served water and coffee without charge. On the next run through about 15 minutes later we got pretzels and salted peanuts. Overall I am impressed by HOP and would recommend it. Great staff outstanding service and a very pleasurable seating experience make it the perfect option for short trips.
The flight was rescheduled without notice. A journey which should have taken 12h became 24h and the passenger my mother who is 77 years old reached home exhausted. She missed the train we had booked before the Airlines rescheduled the flight and finally missed the other train again as the flight landed late. It incurred additional cost as she could not benefit from early online bookings.
The booking process went smoothly. However the cancellation experience was extremely disappointing as there were no alternative options provided. The customer support agent I spoke with was rude lacked compassion and proved to be unhelpful. I had no choice but to book another flight with a different airline which came at a significant expense just to reach my destination 12 hours later than planned causing me to be late for a speaking engagement. Moreover when I called to reschedule my return trip I encountered a similar lack of empathy and was informed that one flights cancellation had no impact on the booking of another. To make matters worse there were no options provided to speak to a supervisor despite being told that I was already speaking to one who displayed the same rudeness and lack of understanding. Overall while I used to consider Jetblue a reliable airline this experience has significantly diminished my confidence in them. From now on they will not be my top choice for air travel.
Premium cabin on new 717s provides access to seating in the front of the aircraft and a meal service. Value for money is okay the fare and upgrade charge were significantly lower than for other full service airlines. If you are a Star Gold customer this is simply not worth it as you already have access to the SAS lounges. LHRHEL breakfast was a plastic box no refinements and free water in addition to free teacoffee provided in Economy. A very basic meal with a small portion of hot food. HELLHR was better with a hot meal and courteous crew keen to refill drinks. Other Star members on similar flight lengths Turkish Aegean TAP do a much better job. This is basic flying at the low cost end of the alliance. I have flown SAS BusinessEconomy Extra in the past and found service to be better the overwhelming impression is of plastic reduced cost and service stripped down to the bare minimum. The 717 is configured for 115 seats in 2x3 and not 120 seats as some have commented there is no seatmap available anywhere. Star Gold customers are given preferential seating.
London Heathrow to Bangkok with British Airways and they operate some of their oldest planes on this route so the screen is only 6 with square lines across the screen. The food is very poor on quality compared to other airlines covering the same route only two offerings of water on the outbound flight. Usually fly this route in business class and British Airways offering is far inferior product on this route also. Despite being Silver member will be voting with my feet and using other airlines when available on all future travels. This was one bad trip too many with British Airways.
Very disappointed with Virgin Australia after series of multiple cancellation and rescheduling our flights. It took us 14 hrs from Sydney to Cairns then ended up missing our luggage. We experienced 1 rude staff at the boarding gate 39. Now early on our holidays we lost our booked rental car and still sourcing for clothing for ourselves. Not sure bow long until they found our luggage.
LAX to Moscow DME return in economy class. The food was fine. The staff were friendly. The seats were fine. I slept for 7 hours with no problems on both the outbound and inbound flights. I would recommend this airline for the price you will not get a better flight.
Perth to Manchester via Doha. What an amazing flight. Comfort from Perth to Doha was excellent seats are huge and the flight crew were amazing. Food and drinks were excellent. The Doha to Manchester route was unlucky in that we had to return to Doha because of a cracked window but both the air and ground crew were very professional keeping us informed of what was happening. Yes we were delayed but safety comes first. We were put on a second Boeing 787 and again the crew were fantastic food excellent and I will not hesitate to fly Qatar again. Having been a Qantas gold member and used Emirates to normally fly Perth to Manchester I will now be using Qatar as my airline of choice.
We have just returned from our honeymoon to Mauritius of which we flew from London to Mauritius via Istanbul. When we checked into the flight hours before departure at London Heathrow we mentioned that we were on our honeymoon to request some good seats or potential recognition of this monuments trip which is typically offered by other airlines. What followed was both underwhelming and quite frankly offensive. On the 9 hour outbound flight between Istanbul and Mauritius we were told at checkin that we would be allocated an entire Central row as the flight was not full so we were individually allocated seats 15D and 15G as the plane had 4 seats in the central row. Instead of being allocated the row as promised by the checkin attendant seats 15E and 15F were allocated to two other passengers meaning that not only was this trivial attempt at recognition of our honeymoon trip not honoured but we had to sit apart for the entire 9 hour journey to Mauritius We were also told that we could not change seats even by the cabin crew when I spoke with them. A similar lack of empathy for our honeymoon was demonstrated by Turkish Airlines on our return journey also. In summary if you are planning for a special trip E.g. A honeymoon I would strongly recommend choosing another airline as Turkish Airlines knowingly separated us for our outbound trip. Thank you for ruining our honeymoon journey.
15 Dec Chicago Istanbul Turkish Airlines business class. Checkin was very quick at ORD airport with kind and very polite agent. Boarding was in order and a separate boarding line for Business class and Elite members. On board was greeted with a warm welcome. Pre takeoff had a glass of Champagne which was perfectly chilled and really enjoyed. Push back was on time. Very professional crew on board in business class. Chef came around and introduced himself and handed over the menu and later took the order for main course. Had ordered special meal AVML Asian vegetarian meal. I was bit disappointed with the special meal as they have been serving the same food for more than a year now. Starter was great so was the main course. I am surprised to see that they have cut down on dessert. I had some desserts and they were delicious. The cabin was very quiet and could catch some sleep. Pre landing hot meal was also delicious. The best part of the whole flight was the crew who worked very hard to ensure each passenger was happy. In short TK has excellent product catering is very healthy and plenty to choose from. The only complaint I have is that they do not come and ask or refill the drink you are enjoying. I suggest they should improve this. Again I will be flying on TK business class end of March this year.
Sao Paulo to Istanbul. Terrible service amenity kit was gave to other Business Class passengers and not to me. In a 12 hours flight one meal as the breakfast was not serviced even when boarding I said would rest first part of the flight and eat later they said ok but later said meal is not served on demand really rude flight attendants. Asked water they said would bring to the seat still waiting. The dinner course was terrible never had a so dry and hard meat asked to change they said no extra meal. This is the kind of treatment you have at Turkish Airlines Business Class.
Cabin crew fantastic as always. Have flown every week with this airline since it started in April 2015. The flights were 104 euros return. The cheapest flight now for a commuter to London is 204 euros if you book months in advance. That is 4 times the price of Ryanair. If you dont book in advance a commuter flight is well over 300 euros. Its just not worth it travel to Cork or Dublin and save yourselves thousands a year if you commute regularly.
Istanbul to Kathmandu. I had high expectations of Turkish Airlines because of the huge seats in business class and the Catering by DoCo Seats were very spacious comfortable it is possible to have a good quality of sleep. But blankets and pillows too small room for improvement Meal was ridiculous Everything was on a tray except the main dish Main dish was served from a cart. After one hour flight no champagne.
They have cancelled the flight 15 minutes before departure. They have booked me another flight without asking about my preferences at than 48 h after the original one. After spending a lot of time listening to their music while waiting for someone to pick up the phone in Customer Care they hung up the phone in the middle of my question without providing useful information. They seemed very bothered by the fact that I could have used some help.
Bad Communication Sunwing did not inform passengers with the correct time of departure on its website on its app or with its emails more than a 6 hour difference. Lack of staff pilots and planes the airline did not have enough people or planes to run its routes especially if circumstances were not optimal. This was the reason of so many delays. Other airlines on the same routes did much better without huge delays days. The airline gave false reasons for its delays to avoid paying passenger compensations even when it was obvious what the true reasons were.
I recently booked flight tickets for me and my family to fly from Hyderabad to Bangalore. But due to the bad weather condition in Bangalore and due to the heavy rains I decided to off my journey and when I decided to cancel all of my tickets the airline showed me a refund amount of not even 10 of the amount I paid. I can say that it is the worst airline ever. I not even showed up and I am cancelling it far more than 24 hours but still the refund amount is low where I felt very bad.
Port of Spain to London Gatwick. Customer service onboard and the warm hospitality of the flight attendants make this superior service. In addition to the edible onboard food unlike BA and the fact that the their plane does not make a one hour pitstop in Barbados makes this airline the choice of selective passengers like myself.
Jakarta to Surabaya. Only 15 minutes delay. Otherwise the usual Lion Air flight. Pretty crew and free checkedin luggage cramped seats that at least did recline and no food or drinks.
Seoul to Novosibirsk. Quite bad experience. The tickets are too overpriced according to what you get. Check in at Incheon airport was terrible. Only 2 counters were available for this flight I had to wait for more than 1 hour and a half to just checkin. When I was done with checkin there were only 30 minutes left before departure but about half of the line was still there. Airlines representative said that the flight will be in time so I have to run through customs passport control and train to concourse. Finally the flight was delayed for more than 1 hour. The flight takes more than 5 hours in tiny A320. OK the plane is brand new but with really low and cheap options. No IFE at all the food is too small and doesnt taste good. Flight attendants are not friendly. The restrooms were so dirty. After 2 hours of the flight there was no toilet paper or tissues left at all. Flight attendants didnt care at all. On the way back from OVB to ICN we had to walk to the plane on tarmac because the company didnt want to pay for a jet bridge. It was 22 degrees outside. The flight was exactly the same. No IFE no service dirty restroom but intime. No baggage is included to the ticket. Service and facilities are like in really cheap Asian low cost companies. You have to pay for everything including seat selection. The seats are just terrible for long flight. But the price is like for 5 start companies for the same flight duration. Will avoid this company for my future trips if possible. Not recommended if you have any other option.
Worst service Ive ever received upon checkin. I am handicapped but do not need a wheelchair. I carry my disability placard and always purchase best seat class available for airlines. I just need extra time getting settled into aircraft and I was refused to board early since I didnt get a wheel chair. I had to wait for several families with children to board first since I was told children are a priority over disabled passengers without wheelchairs. This airline will only recognize disabled passengers if you are in a wheelchair which is ridiculous. I can spend my money on another airline that will respect disabled and elderly passengers that need extra help in the future. I was looking forward to trying this airline. This is definitely a one and done. I will never fly on this discriminatory airline again.
Excellent seats and service although the A380 does not have Q suite seats. I dont see how anyone surpasses Qatars business class. The flight attendants food cleanliness of the aircraft were all unbeatable.
London Heathrow to Bangkok. As you walk into Heathrow T5 you have the feeling of a world class airline and thats where it stopped 20 minutes late for boarding then only after they had got everyone on the plane did they say sorry we have technical problems and passenger didnt turn up it took them 1 hour to fix the plane didnt tell us what the problem was and remove the passengers bags I gave up my seat 38D for a lady wanting to sit with her friends so I got 40D big mistake Seat does not recline and the headrest extender was broken and kept slipping down. Upon takeoff the aircon above decided it was going to start leaking water above when the guy sat in seat enquired the staff smiled said she would see what she can do then went to the galley behind me and I heard her say to a coworker thats the last of her problems. It was the coldest plane I have been on their was people on the plane wearing winter jackets I was that cold I took the blanket put it over my head and wrapped round behind my elbows and pulled it down with my feet. Toilet behind me was continually sucking the whole flight. They had to manually reset everyones screens they were very old the fact my mobile has a bigger screen leaves a lot to be desired. Not to mention whatever you tried to watch would have continual lag. The interior on the seating was old and lumpy Im sitting here writing this 8 hours later and my backside is still raw They dont even have USBs to charge your phone So they encourage you to use their mobile app for digital boarding pass to make it more seamless then fail to put any USB charge points around the plane. Going to email BA and ask for a refund on my return ticket as I can honestly say out of the 20 or so airlines I have flown on over the years this is by far the worst
My family and I flew with Air Canada Rouge from Edinburgh to Toronto then on to Havana and then back to Toronto and back to Manchester recently. I would say that having done a lot of travelling I was very disappointed with the service levels the staff and the quality of experience we had. There is no inflight entertainment which when you are travelling on planes for 10 hours is pretty poor in this day and age. They say you can download an app to your phone and get entertainment through this. We all did this but it didnt work and you couldnt watch anything without it constantly buffering The staff were unfriendly and unhelpful the flight back to Manchester was one of the coldest flights I have ever experienced maybe the pilot left the window open overnight so extremely difficult to sleep when your teeth are chattering The price wasnt that cheap as to justify these corners being cut. Also three out of four flights delayed and two overbooked and looking for volunteers to step off flight If you have another option I wouldnt use Air Canada never flown with them before and thought Air Canada would be good but left extremely disappointed Final point the app also doesnt work for you to confirm seats and do online checkin it takes you to a report an error page which then doesnt work Sums it up for me.
Qatar Airways business class is great really good service. We had a 13 hour delay coming back from Phuket to Frankfurt and the support for refunds is terrible. I put my claim in on 1st March the day after we arrived home and received a notification with a case number since then nothing I rang customer service and was on the telephone waiting for over 30 minutes when i did speak to an advisor he said I would hear back within 48 hours that was a week ago.
Had the most unpleasant experience with checking in. There were three lines one for first class one said main cabin and the third one for dropping the bags. We waited in the main cabin line for 30 minutes because the airline representatives were extremely slow. And when it was our turn to check in we were asked to wait because there were people in the first class line. Apparently first class passengers get a priority in the main cabin line as well. We tried to ask but Hawaiian representatives very surprisingly rude. Ive never had such experience with airlines in USA. Will never use them again.
We were upgraded to Business Class which was a lovely surprise. The staff were exceptional food and drinks were top class and served with smiles and lots of laughter. As my sister and I needed wheelchairs the staff made sure we were treated like royalty. We will never forget the kindness that was shown to us. I highly recommend using this airline for your next flight and discover service beyond anything you have experienced before.
Edinburgh to Perth via Doha. The cabin staff conduct themselves with a smiling high quality service. Toilets were constantly refreshed. Seats were comfortable. Food service on demand worked well. Quality of food was superior to some top grade hotels I have stayed in. A fault in the in flight entertainment defied the best attempts by the cabin staff to get it working properly so a change in the seat was organised. The short change overtime at Doha caused us to miss out on accessing the best business class lounge. As I have to use a wheelchair on arrivals I found the service quite good but there seems to be constant confusion at changeover places. However we still get to the various drop off or change points.
I was informed of a last minute significant flight change Date and Departure 16 days prior to the new flight date. I attempted to speak to a customer service rep as soon as I could but the line was either busy and magically disconnected while on hold so submitted an online inquiry to let them know the flight is not to my convenience. Not to mention that all the notifications were made in German. Of course no response to my inquiry at all and I was excited when the line finally put me through today but this representative told me that only option that I have is to change the flight before the departure then he hang up on me when I was asking him a question. I even listened to the recorded conversation before writing this review to make sure there was nothing wrong on my end. I am sorry for what they have to go through with the current situation with COVID19 but it would not justify this kind of poor customer service they provided. I do hope all of their business would change for the better if they survive.
Leaving Grand Cayman the flight was delayed over 3 hours Im finding out now that delays are a normal part of doing business for Cayman Airways. I was forced to miss my connecting flight out of Tampa and was forced to pay an additional 1700 to cover the cost. Cayman Airways would not reimburse the cost. The Gate Agents were confused and did a horrible job communicating anything. I will not fly Cayman Airways again worst airline Ive ever flown
Emirates is a pretty good airline if you can miss transiting through Dubai airport which makes your trip a horrendous experience. It is exactly what I did. I chose Emirates for a flight from Brisbane to Singapore. On the positive side crew were polite and friendly on board entertainment was good and I liked the food they served. On the negative side my seat on the return flight my seat was broken. I think an airline is expected to check their seats function before long haul flights. Besides the handling of luggage was poor. I checked in a new suitcase but at my destination I received a very dirty one filled with oil stains.
Flew Emirates from Perth to Munich via Dubai. Soon after boarding we had to fill out a menu card to select our meal. Despite being told we could choose when we eat the meal service was at a fixed time. A few hours later when it was time to serve the meal I was told they had run out. They could have worked that out hours before as I was unable to eat the other selections. They said they would write it up to ensure it didnt happen again on the next flight but the next flight knew nothing about it. So the eat anytime wasnt true nor was their resolution. The travel instructions for the business class driver showed the wrong address on his chit in Dubai. It was not the address we provided. Obviously we got lost. The lounges were very ordinary. Fool me once shame on me fool me twice shame on you fool me thrice never.
Currently dreading my flight with BA considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called Live Chat. All we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for me. We just wanted to be able to make a name change. Absolutely impossible. Their website is unusable. Their customer service is a shambles. They couldnt change the name. Told me that we shouldve done the booking more carefully. Well youre going to have these people making mistakes. So maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights. Like hello its the 21st century. You should have a button saying Change name. Anyways not the point. The woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasnt making it clear on what to do. Then when I gave up towards the end of the call I just said thanks for your help Ill deal with it la got cut off. 50 minutes and got nothing. All I can say is good luck.
We booked 4 tickets with KLM because the flight times were convenient and the airplanes new and Ive never flown on a 787 before so great. Outward bound leg was cancelled 24 hours before the flight because of mechanical difficulties of the plane GRZAMS so we had to go via MUC on an old 340. The return leg was also changed which we only learned upon checking in exactly 24 hours before the flight. Now we have to go with Delta on an also old 777. When we wanted to choose our seats as soon as the online checkin was open there were no alternatives at all and we had to sit apart from our family members or pay 120 USD per pax for premium seats. Terrible experience will avoid KLM at all costs from now on.
The service is a shambles I have travelled with Air Algerie more than 6 times since July 05. Their systems need to be modernised No allocated seating carry your own suitcase to the porters on the runway cabin crew never smile or ask if you are okay. Baggage allowance for different people. The only positive comment is they serve relatively hot food. What saddens me more than anything is the fact that the flight is so short it doesnt take alot to make it a good flight The price you pay is extortionate in comparison to what you receive
Absolutely awful. Our flight was very delayed our rep at our resort did not come to the resort at the times he was supposed to and when he was here he was one of the most unpleasant humans Ive ever spoken to. I hope nobody ever has to deal with our rep as their rep. Never choose Sunwing. Everyone else we spoke to who came to our resort on Sunwing had awful experiences too. Bad bad bad.
The seats were hard the seats are too small and too close together. Charging for carry on luggage that fits in the overhead is ridiculous and insane. My ticket was only 165.00 and had to pay that much for my luggage. I will fly Spirit competitors in the future. I will never use this airline again.
Flew London Heathrow to Miami return with BA then onto Bogota with Avianca. British Airways have gone from being a very good airline to barely satisfactory. Not only was the flight delayed by an hour both ways but due to a baggage error they made on the return flight I only just boarded the aircraft on time. On both flights they ran out of one of the food options leaving only the vegetarian dish. They onboard entertain system was low quality a small screen with poor resolution. Seats were more uncomfortable than many other airlines Ive flown in economy Their only saving grace is the generous trolley bar allowance. I had connected from MIA to BOG with Avianca they are a much better airline. Seats were more comfortable and entertainment system of a much higher quality and they had USB charging in economy. Shows how far BA have fallen when theyre being outdone by the Colombian national carrier. If it wasnt for the better price I would have preffered direct flights with Avianca.
My booking required a change to flights due to medical reasons. Virgin did not transfer all details which meant that bags needed to be checked in at the line. The line literally did not move for half an hour. I was told they were not short staffed they were just busy. Staff were generally helpful however considering this wait was due to the airlines error I was quite upset. If you call to change flights make sure they actually transfer all your booking details.
Booked this round trip around 3 weeks in advance. Was rather expensive and I felt tricked into paying to reserve my seat at the time of booking. I found out subsequently that reserving was free within 24hrs of the flight. I felt it was mean of the airline to charge for 1 checked bag. I have flown many times with various European Asian and US airlines in the past 40 years and this is the first time I have incurred these charges on top of what I believe to have been an expensive flight in the first place. The staff encountered as well as the flights themselves were no better or worse than the competition. I will try to avoid American in the future
Nice to Seattle via ParisCDG. Husband and I flew Air France for extended summer holiday in June 2018. New service from Seattle to Paris for Air France so we opted to try them vs other carriers weve used. Checkin staff ranged from clueless to insolent. Onboard the cabin crew could have cared less if passengers were seen to properly and this was in Business Clas. Food served was barely edible for us. Seats were totally lie flat and somewhat comfortable but there are airlines with lie flats in Business that are much better. The business class suites are also very narrow. Air France lost one of our pieces of luggage and currently has no idea where it is despite us having checked in 2 hours before flight departure in Nice and jumping through the myriad of requirements around timing that Air France requires for passengers to queue. We both agreed that this was our first and hopefully last time flying this airline.
Not only are the flight attendants rude but the service is terrible. I took a simple 1.5 hour flight that was supposed to leave at 12 pm. Nope cancelled placed on a connecting flight at 2.45 arrive have my gate changed to the other side of the airport without prior notification and then the connecting flight to my final destination was delayed three times. Low and behold I arrived at my destination at 9.30 in the evening. Would not take again.
I flew from Zagreb to Basra via Doha. Stayed in Oryx hotel. The best airline by far everything was exceptional from beginning to the end. Cant wait to fly again with Qatar airways.
Rome to Belgrade. This was my first and last flight with Alitalia. I was so excited to get on this flight once we came to the airport the staff were so rude no smile no nothing. Onboard my seat was taken by someone else and I have asked to sit next to my wife as we already booked our tickets in advance and booked our seats as well. I was told if there is more space you can move to a different seat if not then just need to stay in my current seat. we took off 1hr 45min late seats were not comfy at all very hard and no space. The service was ok once we took off nothing special. once we were coming to a land into Belgrade the aeroplane kept on dropping and quiet a few passengers were screaming.
Flight from Luton to Alicante last July. 9 hour delay minimal information. No staff on the ground. Arrived in the dark to collect my rental car. Return flight delayed although only 23 hours so felt lucky No stairs to disembark at other end so had to wait half an hour for them to arrive then luggage didnt arrive for a further hour. Would never use them again.
I booked my holiday through Travel Republic to travel on 21st July at 19.40 with Corendon Airlines. The flight was cancelled. Zero communication from Corendon or Travel Republic. Check in desk were clueless and fobbed us off to Jet2. No notifications on airport screens as if the flight didnt exist. Only after phoning Corendon was I informed the flight was cancelled. Hotel stay in Manchester airport and 2 x Jet2 flights for 227 at 16.30 all out of my pocket. First and last time booking with Travel Republic and apparently never flying with Corendon Airlines. Furious. Wanted to give a zero review but not allowed. My holiday ruined Deserves a zero.
Delayed for a reason or another. In flight you are bombarded with commercials they try to sell you anything possible. Horrible airline not recommended unless you are desperate.
Shenzhen to Xiamen. On arrival at Shenzhen Airport I was surprised to find it resemble more of a Chinese railway station than an international airport. Check in was quick. I used the automatic machines with the help of a staff who spoke almost no English. Was charged a fee for overweight luggage which was expected. Onboard the cabin seats were adequate. Was given a snack a muffin peanuts and a tangerine along with water. Was glad to have something to eat but expected a hot meal. At Xiamen luggage arrived quickly and everything went smoothly. All in all Shenzhen Airlines was quite nice. Quite clean and quite efficient.
The first time travelling Emirates Business class and the last. They lost my luggage in Dubai and have now been without it for nearly 3 weeks. They have not contacted me once. I have phoned 3 times and have been promised 50 per day compensation money back for all the clothes I have had to buy and calls back to advise on the progress of tracing my lost luggage. When I ask about how I claim this compensation they refuse to answer. They also refuse to answer timelines for tracing my luggage. They have been utterly useless and disinterested. I have called them used Twitter and Facebook and they have delivered only generic responses. I have lodged two complaints through their complaints portal. No response. Please pick another airline.
Absolute horror airline to fly with. No customer service you cannot speak to anyone in person only by email and they never helpful. Our luggage was lost on Day 1 of our travels 26 June and is still missing 4 weeks. Its either in Addis Ababa or Frankfurt they not sure I bid on business class upgrades which were declined which is fine. But as we started the 2nd leg of our flight we get presented with business class tickets that we had not requested but we now had to pay for.
Hiroshima to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. This is a review of a flight that was cancelled due to COVID19. At first they changed the departure airport to FUK. This was unacceptable since it is a long was from HIJ. So I asked them for a full refund for all flights. Despite what must have been an incredibly busy and stressful time for them and their staff they responded promptly and courteously to all communications including calling me in Japan from Singapore. The refunds were duly processed with no debate as to whether the change from HIJ to FUK was reasonable or not. Well done to them for their excellent service under trying circumstances for everyone. Put the service of some other airlines to shame. And guess what when this is all over and we can start flying again this is an airline I will definitely think highly of even though I never got on their plane.
My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai seated in row 19 and sadly it was the experience I was expecting. This was a 14 hour flight and one would think the crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more however the only time we saw them was during boarding food service and disembarking and without smiles. After and before the food service the crew were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water teacoffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. Thirdly the food was not appetizing and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options veg and nonveg on the plane I was told I cant have the veg because I didnt order it Then why was it an option and it didnt have anything on the side that said Preorder. Ended up taking the meal with he chicken which was dry and hard like a baseball. I didnt eat it. We were served a pizza snack and it wasnt warmed up well. I am not one who leaves reviews but I understand that Emirates is a well renowned brand and company and my review will not matter to them but at the end of the day it was my hard earned money that I used to pay for my Flight. They say Emirates is a number 1 airline in the world and flying them is almost a privilege but I disagree Sorry.
Swoop has the worst customer service. There absolutely no one to contact if you are having trouble signing into your Swoop account as you need to be signed in to your account to access customer service Also when you try to reset your password the temporary password always includes an o or a 0. So you have to try it several ways to figure out if its a number or a letter and the passcode is case sensitive so then you have to try lower case and upper case. In the end it just doesnt work. I asked at the Swoop counter when checking in for our flight if there is a customer service number I can call for any assistance and I was told there is not. We fly to Florida often and have family across Canada. We will be using other airlines until Swoop can figure out their customer service issue.
We were met by unprofessional check in staff who took long to proceed with checkin without any explanation and apology. Then a flight was delayed for almost an hour. No announcement was given. I hope I wont fly with them again.
Gatwick to Oslo. Ive flown 3 times with Norwegian in the last fortnight. Certainly if booked well in advance the ticket prices are reasonable until you have to factor in the cost of delays and late arrivals. I am tired of Norwegian being late. My last 2 flights have been very late and there were no trains from Oslo airport into Oslo when I arrived. Its a real fiddle to try and claim the cash points also. The free WiFi if you can find out how to get on to it was hopelessly slow. Really frustrating.
The service is disgusting. On October 10 I flew from Cairo to Sharm El Sheikh 1 hour. A powerful air conditioner was aimed at my legs. I asked a flight attendant to turn it off. Nothing happened. After 10 minutes I asked her for the second time. Nothing has changed again. She didnt even come and ask if everything is fine and if I feel comfortable. As a result my feet were cold during the whole flight.
The sad decline of our national flag carrier seems to be continuing unabated. I fly the LHRPHXLHR route on a monthly basis and although Ive spoken to colleagues about changing carrier as BA offers the only direct route into Phoenix I have stuck with them. But where to begin The 747400s used are ageing shabby and tired if they were your old horse theyd have been taken to the knackers yard years ago. Throughout the aircraft the seating is uncomfortable space cramped and onboard facilities lacking and limited. The AVOD in economy and the premium variant is restarted with almost comical regularity the screens are smaller than most of us have fitted in our car so you are either squinting or just unable to see the movie you are trying to watch. When the person in front reclines the screen is almost forced into your face such is the limited legroom. Catering is just awful in the economy cabins and only marginally better in business although I see the airline is getting around this now by allowing the the privilege of paying for a meal upgrade. One word of caution here if you are upgraded your meal stays behind despite you paying for it. All in all BA is slipping against the competition and delays are common place as to be expected LHR lounges are in need of a complete makeover and its a rarity to get more than a couple of cabin staff who seem happy in their work. Ive one more BA flight to go and then its adieu from me but then given how they so sparingly issue tier points now its not like Im going to miss them.
Flew with SQ468 on the 27th of November out of Singapore and I was pleasantly surprised The aircraft was in a top notch condition and the food was by far the best food I have ever tasted on an airline. The cabin crew were extremely attentive and were very courteous. I should particularly mention how they look after toddlers very well on board. Load factor was full however this wasnt a challenge for the team at all. The only drawback of an otherwise excellent flight was the fact that the entertainments system malfunctioned so much that I ultimately gave up and went to sleep.
I fly on regular base with TAP. In general I am satisfied with the service. However this time my flight was cancelled at the very last moment and could fly 2 days later. According EU rules tap must compensate me with 600 euro for each ticket. After 6 month I did not hear anything from tap. My request has still the status Under investigation. Such a simple issue TAP should have paid me the compensation automatically. It is a shame that I do not get an answer after 6 month.
This airline is worth the money every time we have flown with them. The staff always moving around the cabin when it is semi dark as some people are not asleep offering drinks or snacks to keep up the enjoyment of flying. The food from Brisbane is a big improvement from June 2022 but the food on the return Singapore to Brisbane was a let down with cold and tough beef and two rude female cabin staff but otherwise great service on all flights. We had to fly Emirates Airline from Mumbai to Johannesburg and this airline needs to look how Singapore Business Class is five star.
Its the worst experience. Ive been at the airport for 12 hours and still not gotten out of Louisville. My first flight got delayed so I got moved to 3.14 pm then to 6.59 pm to Detroit that plain needed maintenance and they was driving up from Nashville 3 hour drive so again another move to Atlanta that plain was 3 hour delayed so of course no plain to Paris. Now I have no clue when Ill arrive in Oslo because there isnt any information to get. You want service and information Stay far away from Delta
The best Australian business class flight I have taken. A friendly welcome by Liam and superb service from Lucinda in business class. The welcome to business class when asking what preflight drink we wanted to the lunch service all done on one tray delivered to your seat and the service of the wine or soft drinks to each passenger was amazing. The meal was wonderful and high quality even a warm bread roll cake chocolate as well as a bottle of water.
Los Angeles to Bangkok via Beijing. Absolutely positively worst airline in the business. Horrible service horrible business class. The lounges are an absolute joke. Never consider them again no matter how much the cost.
Copenhagen to Doha with Qatar Airways. This flight answered my query A350 or Dreamliner Definitely the Qatar Dreamliner. The seat excellent. Onboard dining excellent. Service excellent. Of course its the cabin feel that is the only thing that is different on the A350. Yet the Dreamliner to me has a nicer interior design a more rounded aesthetic nicer windows and a more spacious lavatory. The only thing I cannot totally get used to is the new Qatar IFE system which just feels cumbersome and to me is not intuitive.
Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh. Worst company I ever flew with. I booked 3 flights and all 3 flights were rescheduled more than 3 times. When we were in the airport the plane had a delay of 1 and 12 hours. They are not reliable at all considering that we booked 3 flights and none of them were on time One flight was rescheduled with 4 hours
Chiang Mai to Luang Prabang with Lao Airlines. Wasnt expecting much from this short flight and was very pleasantly surprised. The staff was friendly and efficient. Drinks were provided as soon as possible. I even got my first Beerlao. The food was a snack of 2 apple slices 2 grapes and a bun filled with a piece of ham. The ham didnt look too appetizing to me so I ate the bread. Considering the flight was so short getting anything more than pretzels was a surprise. The flight itself was on time and smooth. The only drawback was that the propellors are loud when youre seated near them.
Buenos Aires to London Heathrow rwturn. The aircraft is very old cabin configuration is very old and tired. IFE screens have not been changed since they were first installed. My Ipod has a larger and more responsive screen. Before taking off in Buenos Aires some pax but not all were offered water or orange juice. I never got any. After take off drinks were offered followed by a hot meal. Food choices ran out in the first row. Seats were uncomfortable footrests were jammed. On the return flight sparkling wine and water were offered before take off followed by drinks and the meal I had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes. Poor movie choices miniature screen and uncomfortable seats. Crew OK. No indication as to which toilets to use either forward in business class or rear economy. Having flown Norwegian on their B787 in their premium cabin on the same route BA is a waste of my money.
The staff were great food was pretty good their seating policy is a sham. For that reason Id never fly with BA again. I have issues with arthritis and they changed my Aisle seat to a window seat at the last moment and I had to endure no room to move for most of our flight from London to Sydney.
June 25th 2014. My wife and daughter boarded in Boston. The door was closed and we were ready to depart for London. Then a baggage cart hit the airplane. We deplaned and that was understandable. After an hour we were told the plane would not depart and there was no room on any other planes for days. Call your friends make your own arrangements was the only customer relations help offered by British Airways. The BA help on the ground said there were no hotels on vouchers. I really yes really thought British Airways was the standard of air travel. If you have any alternative do not book British Airways. Theyre great as long as everything is going as planned. If anything goes wrong they are a confused people who have no idea how to help you.
St. Petersburg to Prague via Riga it wasnt that bad after all. No cabin baggage weighing or measuring as mentioned in some reviews there was nice staff greeting us on board and the plane was clean. IFE consisted only from the inflight magazine but it was pretty thick enough reading for two hours flight. No food snacks or water during the flight but you know that before taking the flight as the companys strategy is going lowcost.
Flew Los Angeles to Tokyo Narita with Singapore Airlines. Pleasant Crew food OK. Nice menu and small amenity kit. The crew seemed very nice and polite but a little robotic. No personalities. The food was ok seats great because its still 9 across in Economy. Many other airlines are 10 across. Impossible to sleep due to the fact that the seat belt sign was turned on and off every 20 minutes and the captain and crew made really loud PAs. Now I understand that its a safety issue. Almost all other airlines have a faster seat belt message come up on your screen. By the 4th OA at 4 am I was ready to lose my cool. Also like other rules Ive never experienced before with competing carries. I was told that because I was at the bulkhead if there was turbulence Id have to restore my back. I thought thats no going to happen. So all in all a nice airline but a lot of hype.
The flight departed a little late. Boarding was organised. Had Aisle seat 84C which chose and paid for At booking. Gluten Free meal served early and cabin crew checked name and request for Gluten free. Best Gluten Free meals on any airline. The cabin crew on this flight worked nonstop. Water and soft drinks between meals which was good. One cabin crew stood out on this flight she was constantly attending passengers needs and had a bright energetic personality. My husband and i arrived slightly late into Brisbane but safely. First flight of 14 hours which i never felt jet lagged and flown this flight many times put it down to only drinking water with meals whole flight.
Just got back from Bridgetown Barbados flying with British Airways and frankly couldnt wait to get off. I was so disappointed. I have travelled regularly with BA but the flights going over and coming back left a lot to be desired. The plane was in need of repair. I had water dripping from the ceiling where I was sitting and when I told the stewardess was told that was usual due to condensation and proceeded to stuff a tissue to stop the dripping. The toilets were so old that bits of the cladding were coming away. The food was awful and inedible. The staff were unapproachable and looked fed up. BA get your act together or youll be losing flyers by the hundreds.
Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh. I read a similar situation in another review they did exactly the same to me. The flight was delayed from 1 pm to 630 pm. I did not have connecting flights so it was not important to me to flight in time. They told me that I could buy a ticket in Vietjet which was a flight that was not even planned since I checked online if there was another flight available. I told them that I would like to receive my money first before buying and they told me that it was not possible no reason was given for these. After that I bought my tickets for 3 million VND and when I asked they said that I had to do the check in first in the airline before giving me the money back I can explain that just if it was a scam I cannot complain if I had to fly in half hour. After checkingin I came back and they gave me a voucher for 1 million VND and I told them that they said that it was a full refund of the other ticket which they denied. I was not able to do anything because they cancelled the other flight and the flight that just bought was about to leave after I arrived to Ho Chi Minh I wanted to file a complaint in the aviation authority that was not possible because it seems that there is no way to file a complain in Vietnam regarding airlines.
London City Madrid return in economy. New Embraer 170 fleet from City airport. The experience was excellent. Checkin seamless. Cabin clean seats wide legroom good. Very spacious feel although stowage room for hand luggage still rather limited. Service was excellent a hot breakfast provided on the way out which was a pleasant surprise. Both flights on time and the captain kept pax informed. Good value for money and no obvious cutbacks noticed. As an executive club silver member lounge access in Madrid and free preseating is much appreciated although checkin online free seating policy I believe works fine. Would fly with BA from city again and recommend them.
Like Eric said I dont understand the bad reviews. I have flown the MaunJNB flight many times and everything has been great. Never had any delays. The last comments are from 2011 and 2010 and now I think they have a brand new fleet. My flight was nice not the best aircraft.
LCYAntwerp. Disappointing experience. Long queue at baggage drop due to only one attendant being present. A second eventually appeared but was inadequately prepared did not have the key to work the baggage belt. Stood there for 5 mins totally ignored whilst the attendant made a barrage of calls to remedy the situation without even a sorry to keep you waiting. Flight OK but I find the Fokker 50s poor and noisy in comparison to the 146s. Overall the same level of mediocrity and couldnt give a stuff attitude that affects so many airlines these days. I would suggest some of their staff need to be sent for retraining.
Worst service and food. Seats are small only 4 cabin crew for 300 people they even sell the headphones if you want to watch a movie bring your own. Also no subtitles available in any language. Took forever for the check in.
Likely the worst airline experience I have had outbound YYZ to PHX on Dec 15 2022 Air Canada suggested that we arrive at YYZ at least 3 hours before AC 1721 for a 925 departure so we staggered in at about 615. At 723 the flight was delayed until 920 We then boarded the plane and waited on the tarmac for about an hour. Then we were ordered off the plane and told to take everything with us. At 1014 the flight was delayed until 1230. Gate agent scolded passengers because someone had used the planes lavatory while it was on the ground and apparently that was the cause for the delay. As if its the first time in the history of air travel that someone used the planes toilet before it left the ground. At 1030 the flight was delayed until 130 At 1125 the flight was cancelled and we were rebooked on AC 1723. Our seats were separated by 14 rows. No refund for premium seat selection that was denied because of the cancellation At 226 there was a gate change At 417 there was another gate change At 521 that flight was delayed until 815 Wheelsup after 9 pm. We arrived at our destination about 12 hours late. Compensation offered A 10 meal voucher. I have travelled all over the world and dealt with scores of airlines and hundreds of airline personnel. I have never met with such rudeness and condescension as I have with Air Canada Rouge. Worst Airline Experience Ever
Eva Airs slogan Striving for Perfection is a strong strap line yet standards have fallen since Covid. I have used Eva on the London to Bangkok route since they started flying from Gatwick in 1994. Unfortunately my first post Covid flight there are a number of issues which need to be addressed. The InFlight entertainment is not what it used to be with limited choice and a really difficult navigation issue where one has to select ones mood before a small choice appears. Food was mediocre and the vegetarian bread roll is served cold yet standard fayre comes with a hot roll. The evening meal was excellent with fresh salmon and potatoes but my breakfast hash was disgusting.
We booked our flights for our family to fly from San Jose to Tambor in November and subsequently booked our hotel and car rental. Today 3 days before we fly they have sent us an email cancelling the flight No explanation or help to change it just a request for details to arrange a refund awful customer service Avoid this airline use Sansa instead.
Tokyo Haneda to Heathrow in Club World with British Airways. My trip was on an old Boeing 777 and apart from the old product I could not believe the dirt and wear in this cabin. Crumbs and mess around the bottom and edges of the seat grubby marks that I presume even the Japanese cleaners could not remove. The toilet I used remained dirty throughout the flight. The meal service has been much debated and is served rather pushed at you on a cheap economy style format and quality is on a par with JAL economy class I used in August. Im British and like to support BA but the honest fact is that BA have slipped right down against from the competition. My journey out was from Frankfurt on Lufthansa an airline I probably wouldnt have used a few years ago but their business class standards are so much higher. BA cabin staff should go to Lufthansa for some training and maybe they could lose some of their arrogant approach.
Istanbul to Ras Al Khaimah. Never chose this company Pay more but dont believe in Pegasus They cancel my flight didnt send any email to advise and gave no refund or compensation. Totally shameful. Beside all that the treatment in the airport was completely disrespectful.
Seoul to Manila . Im traveling alone with my 3 year old daughter from Incheon South Korea to Manila Philippines. I know we had 15 kgs baggage each but I prepared a combine luggage for both of us since Im traveling alone. Given my situation they asked me to separate our luggage because it is their policy even though we did not exceed 30 kgs. I cant carry my daughter with two bags. They are inconsiderate for mothers traveling alone. I will not recommend them nor taking another flight to them.
I havent flown British Airways for quite a while but this journey to Nice drew home to me that BA is no longer the premier airline I thought it to be. Trip was okay no major problems but my point being is that it is no different to some of the many other airlines I have flown such as EasyJet Turkish Airlines Flybe etc. Cabin interior was a bit tired I asked the air hostess for a Diet Coke and didnt receive one. One toilet between 120 odd people in economy isnt great on a 1 hour 40 minute flight. Cluttered galley of people waiting for the one toilet congestion in the aisle blocking the flight attendants trolley not ideal. Dont get me wrong the flight and airline was okay but no different than the other lower cost airlines when comparing ticket prices BA no longer has the edge for me.
This trip was Lima Toronto and Toronto Lima with an stop in Bogota the experience was just not what I expected. I purchased an economy ticket and Avianca didnt provide me not even with a glass of water. At the time of arrival in Toronto we waited 2 hours in the airplane as saying that they dont have any gate available and there was traffic. I know there are some changes with airlines and everything is charge now but water doesnt cost a thing this is unacceptable and was not provided any apologies for waited so long in the airplane. It was a terrible and exhausting trip.
Flew Thomson from Manchester to Jamaica. Do not whatsoever pay for extra space seats on this aircraft and choose row 30 B C G or H they are right by the toilets and other passengers use the space in front of you to queue for the toilet or stand and chat. They completely ignore the fact that you have paid for the extra space and sometimes even try to get around 8 people all stood in the space at one time. Nothing done by the stewards or stewardesses to elevate the problem.
Chicago to Delhi via Istanbul. This is the worst airline experience Ive had. I had given all evidence that my father is critically ill in the hospital and requested a refund of the amount paid for the tickets. In spite of submitting all proof Turkish Airlines did not want to refund any amount. They only were willing to rebook the ticket after multiple requests. The staff at every occasion was rude and not accommodating. I had to submit the paperwork several times and the software as well as the website could not take more than five document at a time. I wasted 34 days calling Turkish Airlines and a travel agency every single day multiple times to reach Turkish Airlines. I will not recommend my friends and all colleagues to fly back Turkish to India or any other part of the world.
I contacted the Qatar Airways Call Center in March 2020 to cancel our intl flights due to the pandemic and border closures. Turns out they never processed our flights voucher credits properly which they admit but still no resolution and 18 months later we are still waiting. When you call the CC be prepared to be on hold for up to 1.5 hours if you can get into the queue. Numerous attempts to contactresolve and still nothing. July 2021 CC sent Doha Sr. Mgmt a priority ticket to investigate and was told to call back in 48 hours. Nothing. Then told wait 10 days then until after the holiday in Qatar then the CC rep says you will have your new voucher numbers by July 31 2021 by email. Nothing. Called Aug 14 2021 for update nothing. Told that CC just initiated a second priority ticket to Doha. They couldnt properly register my new email for communication its changed since original booking. We are out of a lot of . 18 months later and still waiting for our voucher numbers that we are entitled to so we can rebook.
Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh City. Very bad service The changed my flight to the next day the hotline sayed i can get a refund for the the flight ticket. But i need to write an email to the support but i didnt get an answer back.
Going to the plane I was told that the flight was full and there was enough luggage in the plane. Trying to get on the plane I was told that they will take my luggage because its too big which wasnt the case. I was forced to wait for the luggage a small bag no one understood my request and in fact the male stewards on shift ignored me. When I got onboard the plane the space was more than enough. I was really unhappy and my airport experience was ruined.
Absolutely the worst customer service. Cant ever talk to a real person. Tried to cancel due to a medical issue with relative. Did not want a refund but merely a credit towards a future flight when illness over but refused through their automated chat. Again no live person capabilities. The worst airline service experience ever. I would never do business with them again. Ill pay more elsewhere. Beware
EDILCY on Embraer 190 operated by BA City Flyer in Economy short domestic hop back to London City Airport. Flight departed on time but could not land at City due to high winds. Pilot tried twice but had to abort the landing and finally diverted to London Southend. During the whole time good information from the flight deck about what was going on. Once the plane landed in Southend crew was well prepared giving out information during the disembarkation process about the options. Basically passengers could use a coach to be organized by BA to LCY or people could opt to take public transport to London and have the costs reimbursed later. We opted for the Greater Anglia service to Liverpool Street Station which runs regularly and worked well for us. As for the regular service on board full bar service and snacks were offered. FAs were friendly. Service in Edinburgh was hassle free. We had no checked luggage and check in kiosks worked fine with no lines. Terraces Lounge in EDI was quite spacious and comfortable with some food and a nice selection of drinks. Excellent for a regional airport. Especially given the fact that the situation was weather related and clearly not BAs fault I felt that BA did everything possible to make the experience as hassle free as possible. Situations like these when not everything goes as planned tell a good airline apart from the rest. While the actual reclaiming process over BAs website took longer and was less straightforward than expected it finally worked and the difficulties involved were related BAs procedures and information regarding requirements posted on the website. However the agents worked with us to finish the claim and were actually helpful during the process . Oneworld Sapphire
Worst experience ever. Since when easyJet reduced the size of the bags that we can bring on the plane seems that the only objective of the people that are working on the onboarding is to make money Shame on you especially the operators at Napoli airport.
After 1h queuing at the checkin desk I am told that my booked seat is not available. Why do you sell seats that you do not have
Shanghai Pudong to Seoul. The check in process was extremely efficient. Boarding priority given to passengers with special needs business class as well as elite frequent flyer member. The cabin crew were at the door of the aircraft to guide passengers to seats. Asiana Airlines is renowned for its high quality of service. The professionalism of the flight attendant can be seen from the politeness and hospitality. Communication is at ease as they speak good English. A330300 is equipped with the newer generation of Inflight Entertainment with the larger touch screen IFE. In flight meal was served approximately half an hour after take off packed in a snack box. Besides that hot and cold beverages were also served. The in flight catering was tasty.
Baltimore to Frankfurt via Keflavik. Worst airline ever We got stuck in Reykjavik on a base for 24hrs and then they flew us to Berlin instead of Frankfurt and provided a bus to bring us to FRA. We took the train and wanted to get our money reimbursed but they couldnt even do that worst airline ever do not book with them it is cheap but you will regret it soon
Checked in online only to receive half of my boarding documents namely the leg from Paris to the US. For the first flight from Lisbon to Paris I had to stand in line for over 40 minutes so that they would print it And it seems they did the same thing to many US bound passengers. What is the point of all those prechecks scanning passports into apps and phones checkin in online if we all end up standing in lines with no bags to check They first line you up in the middle of the hall I guess so that others would stumble over you when rushing to their lines and then open 3 out of 6 announced windows. It is precisely this kind of inefficiency that is begging to be replaced by AI.
Perth to Vientiane via Singapore. Beware the stopover with Singapore Airlines. My husband flew straight home from Laos but the rest of us myself and our 3 teenagers decided to stay in Singapore for 4 nights. I would have thought the national airline would be encouraging passengers to stay and spend money in their country. We were charged an extra 437.50 per person to do this. On emailing and phoning the airline on several occasions the explanation given was the flights were a different code. With further enquiry I was told that departure tax was part of the cost. This when asked amounted to about 30 each So I wont be flying with Singapore Airlines again and suggest you check the cost of your tickets to see how much extra you will be paying to stayover
BA used to be a byword for quality and service. You simply cant say that anymore and the only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the ticket price. I paid 600 dollars for my ticket from Istanbul to London with BA. For that price there is no airbridge you will wait on a crowded bus and no entertainment note this is a 4 hour flight. Also screen devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight so no alternative of watching movies on your iPad. Oh and youll have to buy any food and drinks on board. I flew BA on this route because no other flight time worked for me however Turkish Airlines is by far the better option with airbridge free hot meals and a modern entertainment system. Pegasus and AtlasGlobal offer a similar service to BA but at far lower prices. It seems to be the same all over. BA used to be a first choice but at this price for this service its become a last resort.
I flew with Air France from London Heathrow to Ho Chi Minh City via Paris. Both flights were enjoyable. The seats were comfortable both aircraft looked new and clean. Flight attendants were polite friendly and helpful. The food served for the Paris Ho Chi Minh was quiet good compared to other airlines. Hope to fly with Air France again soon.
London to Tehran back in August 2017. The cabin looked so old and tired I struggle to understand why BA has not updated yet on a lot of their B777 aircraft. The inflight entertainment screen was small with a resolution of something from the 90s but the selection of movies was alright. The meal service commenced 2 and a half hours after taking off and considering this was a night flight most of us were been starving at this point. The option I wanted ran out by the time they got to me and I wasnt even sitting in the last rows of the economy section. The seats were very uncomfortable. A couple hours later there was another drinks service.
Stansted to Antalya. Very comfortable flight food is very good and cabin crew were very friendly. Boarding started on time and our flight was on time. However for a 34 hour flight there was no entertainment.
The flight has been perfect the crew are very friendly and the cleaning is great as well as no waiting. The flights have been quite enjoyable also with the WiFi on board you can be entertained. El vuelo ha sido perfectolos tripulantes muy amables y la limpieza estupendaademas de sin esperas . Yan sido los vuelos bastante amenosademas con el wifi a bordopuedes estar entretenido
Awful experience. I cant explain how angry I am. I paid nearly 500 for a comfort pack to fly with my wife and my little daughter. With this pack you should get a priority boarding extra legroom seat 23kg baggage and 2 other bags on board and apart from the luggage I havent received any of the benefits I should have get so no priority boarding and no extra legroom seats for us. Ive been in the queue with the baby for half an hour and nobody cared. Same awful experience on our return flight as well. Another awful experience was when I bought a flight for my family Ive been charged but I havent received the flight confirmation and there is no way of reaching them on none of the 3 numbers given on their website nor by email nor by messenger or Instagram page. Ill never fly with them again even if I will need to pay more for a flight with another airline. Avoid at all cost. I wish I had read the reviews before.
Singapore to London. Incredibly inept Admin. I spent time establishing parameters for which my elderly mother could get a seat close to the lavatory and after many calls direct to Singapore I had confirmation that the range of seats we would get was limited but acceptable. I got this in an email. At boarding it became clear the layout for our flight was vastly different to that which had been shown previously. She was as far from the lavatory as she could be. Other passengers could not pass us in the aisle and the journey to the lavatory took 10 minutes with the turbulence we encountered. No aisle seats was available in Business class despite a prior agreement that one would be aboard. I may as well have not bothered dealing with the airline. That SIA failed to deliver on this flight and the ensuing return later shows the customer what the airline think of even their Business Class passengers absolutely nothing. There is little their superb inflight service did to improve the bitter resentment on my part. I expected much better after the initial discussions I got contempt.
Shubuling to Shenzhen. However did Star Alliance admit this low quality airline into their more prestigious alliance The website is absolutely awful in English and in Chinese. After failing to purchase a ticket through their website I managed to buy one on Ctrip. But then the online checkin did would not work. However the verification function on the Chinese language website reassured me that my ticket did exist. Airport checkin was ok as I was first in line. However then the flight was delayed by an hour then after boarding an announcement of another half hour then half an hour later yet another delay. I wondered if it was a ploy to avoid paying compensation and why they just did not let us deplane and wait in the lounge. Being vegetarian I would have needed to preorder my special meal but as web check in was not available I was not able to order. The only positive was one very polite and helpful stewardess whom my translator guessed wanted to please the foreign guest as the flight crew was otherwise quite impolite to their passengers. In flight entertainment Heidi a German language film on a screen too distant to read the subtitles.
Ive been travelling with CAL for years and Ive had little to no complaints. Checkin was always fast customer service is pretty good and the food is good and the majority of flights are very smooth. My only discomfort was sort of my fault when I checked in late and I got a seat with the emergency exit directly behind me those seats cant recline and I was a bit uncomfortable while trying to sleep on a 2hour flight. I dont pay much attention to inflight entertainment during flights less than 5 hours but Id say it can be a hit and miss which depends on what movies they show. They choose the movies not you. I wish they had bigger screens or those right in front of me though. Apart from that Ill recommend them.
Travelled from Paris to Bangkok on a night flight and returned from Bangkok to Paris on a daytime flight some 15 days later. Plane was satisfactory and the premium economy seats were up to standard. The main thing lacking on long haul Air France flights is the gap between meals and snacks 7 hours. I recommend that if you are travelling long haul with Air France you take a packed lunch or a meal deal with you when you board. We were arriving 45 minutes late at Paris on our return flight and enquired whether our connection to the UK would wait for us as we only had 70 minutes to get from one plane to another with delay leaving us 25 minutes and as gate closes 15 minutes before flight departure leaving us a max of 10 minutes. Reply from cabin crew was I do not know they will get you on the next available flight or they will put you up in a hotel. It is their fault. Cabin crew on our flights between Manchester and Paris were far better standard than long haul.
Had a great experience with Norse went with premium economy. It was the same cost as economy from other airlines for same route. The seats were wider and reclined better. We were served drinks on the plane as soon as we got on. We got two meals for our eight hour flight. I received two 187 ml bottles of wine with my meals at no charge. The plane left on time and arrived early in Washington. The priority check in at Gatwick went quickly. We got checked in in about 15 minutes. Much longer check in time for regular passengers. I flew delta from jfk to prague about 10 days earlier via economy and was miserable. Seats were small and cramped. The premium economy on Norse was well worth it. Everyone was very pleasant.
What a great airline Very spartan no free amenities you pay for anything humble that you eat or drink. No blankets no pillows no movies no mini screen just for you no wifi. Very comfortable seats though. No nothing you are used to and pay through the nose for on regular airlines. But wow what a great new airline. First time I have had young attractive friendly helpful flight attendants males and females. They wear red. They are cheerful. Not one unpleasant selfcentred passengers on my trips. The airline is based in Iceland and the PLAY planes are red. Bright red all over. 404 dollars for a roundtrip ticket to Spain. For that kind of cost I have no problem bringing my own sandwiches and soft drinks into the plane. We had a lot of heavy turbulence in January flying over the Atlantic but the captain explained about the wind and current flows and assured us we were not going to die. I cant say enough good things about this airline and I have travelled all over the world for years and years. I used to fly Pan Am a lot so you can assume I am no spring chicken when it comes to flying. I hope PLAY stays a guarded secret but successful by those of us who have experienced it. In other airlines we would all have been treated like riffraff in the back of the plane. Thank you PLAY and see you again soon. My flight number was MOY45B but I am home now and certainly didnt SAVE my boarding passes or any other ephemera of the journey. I am sending this review anyway because this is a great new airline.
Paris to Vienna. My recent flight with AF was a pleasure from beginning to end. Easy to use IOS app both at purchase and check in. Airport check in was smooth with no line at CDG T2F. Security line was longish but not too bad. Hand luggage allowance is generous 12 kg. Boarding was fast and ordered divided by zones. Economy new seat is great in terms of comfort. Cabin was clean. Breakfast consisted of pain du chocolate and coffeeteesoft drink which was ok for 80 min flight. New entertainment system was a huge surprise to me. You log in to Air France onboard wifi and get internet for messaging for free plus flight info plus variety of tv shows and movies also for free. USB port is at every seat. Arrived on time bag was on the belt in 15 min. Miles arrived to my account next morning. Flight price was 44 euro. Brilliant.
I have been at the airport since 1000 AM this morning. Flight from Buffalo delayed twice. Flight from Atlanta delayed at least 3 times. No rhyme or reason given. Very disappointing and discouraging. No reason to have to pay outrageous prices for such poor inept and substandard service. I was on one plane and thank God it was not an emergency the acoustics were abominable. Could not understand a word the steward was saying. I would think thus would be an FCC violation Please provide acceptable communication
Insel Air is probably the worst airline I have flown. I had a ticket from Caracas to Curacao on June 23 leaving at 10.30pm. A week ago they changed the flight time to 07.40am. I emailed them to say that this didnt suit me because I had a connecting flight that afternoon but received no response. To leave Venezuela I had to forfeit my ticket and purchase another ticket out and could only get a ticket to Aruba at short notice. When I arrived I went to the Insel office to explain my situation. They said I had to pay a 110 penalty to fly to Curacao to make my connection. The flight from Curacao to Santo Domingo was delayed 2 hours finally after leaving and 1 hour into the fight we turned back to Curacao because of mechanical problems. Right now we are sitting in the transit lounge with no information about what happens next. Avoid this airline at all costs.
Santorini to Rome. Worst experience Ive had what a money grab was early to the airport after checking in online and my flight was delayed and then I finally was ready to board and they made me go back through security just to change my name because you have to pay to put your middle name on your ticket so I almost missed my flight and had to pay 50 euros to change my name. Absolutely ridiculous will never fly with blue panorama again. This is a money grab.
Flew from LHR to TXL on 14714. Could not complain about a single aspect of this flight considering it was just over an hour paid extra for seat choice and a snack and both went off without a hitch. Departed on time and landed on time staff were fine everything was fine. Will look at flying Germanwings again should I have cause to return to Germany.
ARNTLL in Economy. My first experience with Estonian Air was disappointing. What should have been a short 45minhop ended in a 5hourdelay no proper explanation given no offer of rerouting via Copenhagen the only compensation I got was a meal voucher worth 10 euro. Legroom on the B737300 was standard economy class but seats looked pretty wornout. Cabin crew was polite but hardly smiling. To apologize for the delay soft drinks and coffeetea were offered for free but it is the first time ever I am being served coffee in a plastic glass
Ljubljana to Moscow. Both flights on time. Cabin nice and fresh seating much better than average in economy. To my surprise Aeroflot introduced hot meals also for flights of less than 3 hours. Menu card for lunch with 2 options and in return for breakfast with 3 meals nice and tasty. Cabin crews pleasant and working hard. Overall great flights. The only problem is that they do not send relevant information to passengers e.g. 24 hours before departure the departure terminal in the mail from Aeroflot was F which was wrong the departure terminal was actually D a very different one far away. Still when it comes to economy product Aeroflot and Turkish stand out from the rest in Europe.
This was my third time to fly EVA Air with a long flight and 2 transfers. Having the first leg DALSFO with Alaska Airlines is great. It was comfortable and check in was smooth. The staff were very friendly. The actual EVA Air flights from SFOTPE and TPECEB were also good. The staff were efficient and the flights were comfortable. I chose a low calorie meal which was great since you get veggies and fruits and protein There was no selection which was fine but the first meal protein was dry. Most of the time it was chicken or egg whites. My last meal with chicken was delicious though But this was my very first time that my bags did not arrive. My bags were yet to be located as of this writing. The transfer from TPECEB was a little bit chaotic knowing that my previous flight SFOTPE was delayedwhich the airport crew handled well btw. The next leg was also moved. I was not worried since in my previous experiencesthey always make sure that you get to your flight.
Flew Bundaberg to Brisbane 6 March. Aircraft late which meant I just caught Sydney connecting flight. No explanation offered. Return flight 19 March 1.5 hours late. Scheduled for 6.30. Departed 8 pm. No explanation offered. Not spoken to by ground staff. Too many routes for the number of aircraft in the fleet. Happens regularly now. Driving is the only option on many occasions.
Flew SINDOH and DOHCPH on a new A350900 and Boeing 7879 respectively. The flights were on time and aircrafts were new. Qantas lounge in Singapore is good but close early. Referred to SATS lounge which is 2 steps down but still OK. In Doha The Al Mourjan lounge did the morning job and I got a nice shower. Boarding in SIN by jetbridge and later in Doha by queuing up and scrambling in bus to the remote aircraft. Was given a full 3seats section on both flights to allow for stretching out. No dinners nor lunch was served onboard only a sugarish minisnack. Drinks offering is meagre though a sparkling wine is offered in economy. Teas were good. Breakfast sessions prior to landing was good I had a curry fish with rice. IFE top notch and easy to use. IFE world class userfriendly large monitors touchscreens plenty of new and old movie offerings and headsets were provided. These days there is ample space in economy class while business appear almost full. FAs are plenty they pay attention though not overly generous with provisions. Recommend.
Just completed a roundtrip on La Compagnie. The upgraded setting is wonderful less than 80 passengers per plane reclining seats great service. Their schedules are a problem delayed both ways and late schedule change because they sometimes combine the flight returning from Europe. We missed our connecting flight but they put us up in a hotel.
I flew with Air Niugini 24 August 2015 from Port Moresby to Bali with a B737700. Overall not very good in service and the flight attendants did the minimum. Check in at POM Airport is very poor just 2 ground staff to do that and they are very strict with baggage handling and baggage weight. On the B737700 there were 7 flight attendants but just 2 working in Economy Class causing a very slow service. Inflight Entertainment seat and toilets were ok.
Not impressed. I was supposed to get a discount as advertised for joining their loyalty program. Never got one as they claim their software is unable to honor the offer to anyone who doesnt have a local Thai phone number. How many international travelers use this route On top of that they never even answered my corresponding questioncomplaint to customer service. On the date of our flight it was delayed multiple times absent proper communication. Got in hours late. Old and tired plane.
POSMIA MCOKINPOS. Online checkin for POSMIA segment. Agents at counter in POS were average but checkin fast. Onboard snack was okay only one pass for the drink service. Flight was a bit late and lines at passport control in MIA were long. On my return from Orlando even though we had prebooked seats we were told we would be sitting apart and we would have had to pay for seats together. AC on the aircraft was not working. No meal service on this segment just a drink and a biscuit. KINPOS leg had the same problems no AC and engine problems. Mediocre service on this leg. Arrival into POS was 40 mins behind schedule. Overall the service was below what I am accustomed to at AA however if your expectations are very low then this can be your choice of airline.
I flew from Cairo to Heathrow on what they call euro club class which is a cramped coach seat with the middle empty seat. Horrible service. I get to Heathrow airport 40 minutes late so I had to run around looking for my connecting flight. Finally jumping through escalators and train to another building where is my gate. Given a seat that is different than what I paid extra for Its a shame for such well known airline.
British Airways from Seattle to Johannesburg via London Heathrow. First leg SEA to LHR was on a 747. The plane was satisfactory to me. I dont understand the comments from people who think the 747 is tired or worn out. Not a bad ride in economy when the person in front of you doesnt recline their seat. I sat in one of the twosomes seat 52A in the tail. The food on this leg was bland the continental breakfast was a disappointment. I would buy seat 52A again if I was traveling on a British Airways 747 but be advised there is no wall next to 52A that you can lean on to sleep. Second leg was on an A380. I sat in the tail of the upper deck in seat 82A. This time the young woman in front of me reclined to the maximum as soon as she could and kept her seat that way the entire 11 hours of the flight. The A380 is a very nice plane and the overall experience was pleasant despite extensive turbulence the majority of the way. The upper cabin on an A380 is amazingly quiet. The food on this leg was far better with an English breakfast served prior to landing in Joburg. I would not play for seat 82A again because there are two boxes under the seat in front of 82A that limit foot room but I would play for seat 82B which is an aisle seat. IFE on both legs was pretty sad but Im not one for popular culture. Cabin attendants on both legs were polite and did a very nice job. BA ground personnel at Heathrow were very nice and helpful. Ive traveled between South Africa and North America about a dozen times over the past two years. Flights that require you to change planes in the Middle east or Europe fly over Africa and so tend to be very bumpy even at night when most convective activity dies down. Nonstop flights that are routed over the Atlantic Ocean tend to be much smoother.
Tel Aviv to London. We arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take. The stories were true although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc. There were limited priority options available for First Class passengers although I suspect that is more down to the airport than British Airways. The lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first and isnt really acceptable. If it was just business then it would be fine I guess but there is not very much seating the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited. Even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another very complicated machine with all instructions only in Hebrew. At the gate there was the usual priority boarding queue as well as the regular queue. But the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all Oneworld emerald sapphire and ruby members which is a lot of people Whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members there really should be another queue for first and Oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long. The service on board didnt start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew I got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front I had to go to the galley and ask. They were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldnt happen in first. The seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space. Annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing which limits how much you can watch. It was the Thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch. The food and drinks on board were all excellent including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well. Aside from the hiccup at the beginning the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special. It would have been nice to have been referred to by name which I have had before on BA and with other airlines even in business class. On arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick. Overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew let down only by the ground service in Israel. I used Avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for money.
Amsterdam to Pisa at 1020 gate closes at 1005. We enter the controls at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport at 830 we leave at 1000 at 1008 we arrive at the gate. They were intransigent even knowing that we had been at the controls since 830. No refunds no discount for flight changes.
The flight from Paris to Sao Paulo with Air France was excellent. Service friendly and professional. Meals and beverages on board were first quality. I slept 7 hours and arrived relaxed into Sao Paulo.
There was no water or juice served for one and half hours which was ridiculous. Food serving was chaotic as crew moving back wards and forwards in a disorganised fashion. We ordered Hindu non veg meal and ordered meal were missing from the cabin crew list. Quantity of my food was horrific. Service was all over the place and chaotic. When I questioned they said there are 30 kids travelling on a full flight.
Bangalore to Bangkok. Do not book AirAsia assuming it provides cheap fair It is a trap. They show low fare without check in baggage and while boarding they will charge you 5k INR if cabin baggage excess by half kg or more. They keep extra people to deal with you and go any extent.
After reading some of the less stellar reviews online and being unable to reach any English speaking staff on the phone who could verify the incabin luggage dimensions I was naturally apprehensive about the flight from Tel Aviv to Nice on Monday September 23 2013. To my pleasant surprise the entire flight experience was excellent. The plane was clearly in great shape a relatively new aircraft with leather seating and spotless interior. The departure and arrival were pretty much on schedule. The fact the departure from Ben Gurion airport was using a shuttle bus and not a jetway reminds me to warn any future passengers during any unlikely but possible inclement weather to dress accordingly or bring an umbrella for the extended exposure to the elements while trying to board an outdoors staircase. Other than that I thought the whole experience was most pleasant and I would have no qualms about flying Israir again.
Last time that I will fly with Turkish Airlines. Flight delayed and I will miss my connection and the rebook is up to 16 hours. The customer service is not efficient and arrogant.
Warning AirAsia booking policies are deceptive You can search for the best ticket price for a route and think that AirAsia is the lowest but one page before you pay AirAsia adds a significant processing fee without warning such that you cannot compare AirAsias ticket price to another airline The only way to check for the accurate ticket price is to go all the way through the booking process and almost purchase the ticket. This is unfair and deceptive Stay vigilant
I had very unpleasant experience with Turkish Airlines. On 5th of February I purchased ticket from Chicago to Kazan via Istanbul for dates of Apr 1 2020 Apr 17 2020. I printed out confirmation and was happy about my purchase. It showed that transaction went successfully and I did not receive any email or notification that there is any problem with it. Next day I id login to my account to select seats which I did successfully. And that is it. Today on the 2nd March 2020 I decided to login to my account in order to change the seats and could not locate my ticket although I have both Reference number and ticket number. After multiple attempts to find my ticket I had to call customer service on this phone number 8008748875. I spoke to representative and explain my issue. I gave my ticket number and she located it. But she said that it was cancelled and refunded. When I asked why it was cancelled and who did this she replied that it was cancelled by the system. Unfortunately she did not provide clear explanation why that happened. Also there was no apology for inconvenience at all. She suggested filling out feedback form on the website and calling back with Feedback reference number. She said that in that case I will be transferred to Customer relations and they will be able to see detailed reason and will be able to explain the situation. I fill out feedback form and attached prove I have that I purchased the ticket. After that I called again and gave that number to operator also I want to mention that all the agents I spoke to where kind of rude and inconsiderate. Which is shocking and unacceptable and I did not expect that such a company will have such poor customer service. I was transferred to customer relations. After couple minutes she got back to me and said that my ticket was cancelled right away and refunded by system. And again I did not hear clear explanation why that happened. Also there were no apologies no saying sorry. She just said that she cannot do anything and that is it. I asked her to see if there is any solution she muted me and even did not listen to me talking. I asked her to take of the mute so I can feel that I am speaking to live person. She said that she did that so there will be no noises on the background. I said that it does not bother me. I tried to explain my issue again so she can advice solution and again right in the middle of me talking she put me on mute again. After that she started interrupting me and giving sign that she fed up with me and she wants to end this conversation. She put me on mute again and in that moment I asked her to transfer me to supervisor or manager. She did not reply back I started saying Hello Hello. She took me from mute and said that she hears me and that she cannot help me. I asked her did you hear my question. She was not able to confirm that she did. I said that this is very disrespectful and that I will be complaining about my experience.
The team at Melbourne Virgin lounge and the crew on flight 1328 Melbourne to Hobart were absolutely amazing. I had injured my knee on way to the airport and was unable to put weight on it. Every person I had contact with from the service desk to the young chap who wheeled me to the gate to the fabulous ladies on the flight and the ground grew at Hobart went above and beyond what I expected. They were kind helpful and made me feel comfortable even though I was embarrassed at all the fuss I was causing. I fly regularly with Virgin and will always recommend them.
Returning from Cabo San Lucas our flight was delayed by almost an hour. Not usually a problem but we had to catch a connecting flight in Phoenix to Denver. After rushing through the airport we found that we had missed the connecting flight Ok no worries we were scheduled on another flight to Denver 3 hours later. After waiting for almost 3 hours that flight was cancelled. No explanations just cancelled. The customer disservice person at the US Airways counter was rude arrogant and even threatened us with calling the police if we didnt leave the counter. We called his bluff and he put down the phone and printed us two boarding passes for yet another flight another 3 hours later. This flight was overbooked and we were not even guaranteed a seat. By this time I got on my iPad and booked a surprisingly cheap flight on another airline no fuss and we were on our way to Denver within the hour. It was just a nightmare day from start to finish but by some wild chance of a miracle we did find our luggage when we landed in Denver. Apparently the baggage handlers do know how to do their jobs. US Airways is unreliable and their people are unprofessional incompetent and downright rude. We will never fly this airline again
Milan to Dakar with Air Italy. Both flights were on time on new B737MAX8 seats were narrow and if the next seat was occupied you felt cramped. Legroom was 30in we bought expensive LXseats 2 rows after business 2 rows by exits. No IFE and for 6 hour flight could be a problem our flight was a red eye one so we slept all the way. Service was professional and food was plenty and tasty. Overall a good experience.
Cucuta Colombia to Havana with Cubana Airlines. On our outbound flight there was a 4 hour delay and then every half hour the flight was pushed back another 12 hour until after a 9 hour delay we were loaded onto the flight. The plane had not been cleaned in a long time. On return flight we arrived checkedin and went to the gate no customer service agents were present. At our scheduled departure time no gate agents present. One hour after our scheduled departure time no agent present and so on finally a short announcement on the PA told us to wait in an un airconditioned cafeteria we did for more than an hour. Finally seven hours after our scheduled departure we were boarded on a chartered nonCubana air plane.
Tokyo Haneda to Singapore. Highly impressed with my first flight with Japan Airlines in a few years. Ground staff were attentive and genuine which set a nice first impression. Seating was comfortable on Boeing 767 window seat with sufficient leg room. Midnight departure meant a small snack and drink after take off beer was served ice cold a big plus Enjoyed the entertainment system though range not as diverse as other airlines. Breakfast served 2.5 hours before landing quite tasty with tea and coffee plentiful. Friendly service with a smile look forward to my next flight with Japan Airlines
They lost my baby stroller during the interchange in Dubai. The baby stroller has been delivered in a few days but as I already went to another city I was not able to get it from the airport. They dont deliver it to your address you have to pick it up from the airport yourself. When I got a baby stroller some important parts werent there. Ive contacted flydubai baggage service team and claimed that we cant use the baby stroller without those parts as its just not safe but for more than 10 days and more than 4 emails already I havent got any real help.
Montreal to Bucharest via Istanbul. Delicious food great choice of beverages. Cabin crew kind and careful. I would choose Turkish again and can recommend them.
Im a frequent flyer with Diamond status at SAS. I was flying with Eurowings and expected to have priority boarding but it was showing group 5 on my boarding pass. I approached a representative of Eurowings and asked why I was placed in group 5. She says the system assign your group so please have a seat. I was totally surprised to receive that ignorance from a service person working for them. Sounds like all negative reviews are true.
Dubai to Southampton via Paris CDG with Air France and FlyBe codeshare. Efficient check in at DXB and lounge in Dubai is the Skyteam lounge. The lounge seemed fine efficient staff modern look and clean. Snacks looked fine though I did not try them and reasonable drinks selection. Boarding on time clean aircraft and good business seats. I chose Air France over BA on this route to try out an alternative. I have now flown a few times with Air France and rate them highly. However on this middle east red eye flight I feel that BA sleeper seats are better than those of AF. The service from the Air France staff was excellent though. Snack served after take off which was fine breakfast was OK BA serves better juices and coffee in my view but the food component was good. Landed on time in CDG layover of 11 hours. The FlyBe flight to Southampton was fine friendly staff. All in all a good flight. What is not clear though and this was also true of AF ground staff is where these flights are sold as Air France flights on a business class ticket and priced as such and then the short hop to UK is with FlyBe which lacks a business cabin we should still get access to the lounges of Air France relevant if you have a long layover. In fairness to Air France I had asked them about this in advance told we would have access and then when I turned up with my children today the agent said technically we did not have access. However she used her discretion and let us in as we had flown from Dubai with them. Whilst I do not know what is right or wrong its gestures like that which make me really like Air France. Their staff try very hard and go the extra mile . I lost my computer on my outbound flight and their ground crew found it and bought it to me.
The worst airline ever. First they rescheduled my flight which will be 3 hours later than the original time. It was acceptable. But when I did the online checkin I realized they had downgraded my seat from premium economy to economy class. So I gave them a call. The customer service just informed me that the transit time of the rescheduled flight is too short which is 1.3 hours. I will definitely miss the connecting flight. Why did they provide this flight for me in the first place If I did not call then I would have missed the flight and been stuck at their airport for a day As a result I have to book another flight from another airline which is twice more expensive than the usual fee since I booked it last minute. So please dont ever fly with them. Its a waste of money and time.
On the 15th December 2017 I travelled from Pattaya Thailand to Jakarta Indonesia on Air Asia. I had to change in Kuala Lumpur for my second and connecting flight. The connection was bearable. The service on board was pleasant. We arrived very early in the morning in Jakarta so I had to sleep for a few hours before catching a local bus to Jakarta City. I always try and fly Air Asia.
The cabin is clean. The seat is comfortable. The ambience is quiet. Flight attendants are friendly and helpful. The food is delectable and fresh. The price is reasonable.
ZRHLHR. A bit of a disaster. My flight BA 719 was delayed 90 minutes and so was the preceding flight. So one is acceptable two is well a coincidence. or not. Left 90 minutes late about 20 minutes after the earlier late departure got stacked over Kent landing about 2 hours late from a 80 minutes flight. Plane was almost brand new. Crew was great but in the end couldnt care less. BA at its worst. Pathetic.
Jeju to Seoul. The online website to purchase tickets was easy to use as a foreigner. There was an English option unlike Tway air. The checkin boarding process was very efficient. The plane was spacious and the seats comfortable for a budget airline. I would fly with them again.
Another great flight with Air Transat I prefer this airline than any of the other charter airlines out of Toronto Pearson. Flew club class. Service excellent start to finish friendly staff. Nice meal and snacks. Amenity kits comfortable big seats big screens. Content is a bit dated but something to entertain. Flight left on time arrived early. Onboarding quick. Exiting the plane was quick and efficient. Bags arrived and were off the plane fast. Air Transat has never let me down.
I traveled back and forth from Paris to Tokyo with Japan Airlines and it is by far the best airline I have traveled with. I am a great traveler since I work in tourism. I found the staff at checkin and on board welcoming helpful attentive and available. The meal trays were plentiful and very good as well as the snacks between each service. Finally the space between the seats is wide which allows the legs to unfold well the size of the screen was also perfect. I have traveled pleasantly I would take over this company without hesitation and for my customers too. FR Jai voyage en allerretour Paris Tokyo avec Japan Airlines et cest de loin la meilleure compagnie avec laquelle jai voyage. Je suis une grande voyageuse puisque je travaille dans le tourisme. Jai trouve le personnel a lenregistrement et a bord accueillant serviable a lecoute et disponible. Les plateaux repas etaient copieux et tres bons ainsi que les encas entre chaque prestation. Enfin lespace entre les sieges est large ce qui permet de bien derouler ses jambes la taille de lecran etait parfait egalement. Jai agreablement voyage je reprendrais cette compagnie sans hesitation et pour mes clients egalement.
OrduGiresun to Istanbul. Excellent service for a short flight. It was the first flight of the day taking off at 450 am. Though full it was on time and all procedures check in and boarding were performed swiftly. The cabin was nice though no individual screens just overheards for safety demonstrations and maps along with a few commercials. Very professional crew elegant and efficient and amazingly cheerful captain announcements was very pleasant. Although planned for 1h 45 duration the flight lasted a short 1h20 minutes. During this time economy service was performed with tea coffee juices served in elegant paper cups along with hot salty pastries. Excellent landing. Very pleasant.
Singapore Medan MI234 16 April 2016 6C. Transit in Singapore. Checkedin from the previous destination. Ground service was a little bit disappointing they had changed my seats without notifying me by email or phone and because I already had my boarding pass from the previous destination I did not go to the transfer counter. However I did not have any passengers in the middle and window seat so I could see the view and easily get out for toilet without disturbing other passengers. The seat was good and new. The cabin crews were okay. I tried the IFE by WiFi as this is one of their facilities onboard it was great but had less choice. Food was decent for a short haul flight. Overall it was great but pricey for a short haul flight.
The worst experience I had in a flight journey. The flight departure was 9 pm it got delayed by 3 hours. No intimation of flight delay. Gofirst is a third class flight. The staff not giving a proper explanation of delay.
We flew from Boston to Amsterdam via Keflavik. Our tickets were approximately 1300 per person round trip expensive traveling in July. We checked in two bags at 70.00 per bag. When we arrived in the Netherlands on a Sunday one of the bags did not arrive. This bag contained everything for two people in our party. Our bag finally arrived shortly before midnight on Tuesday and we flew home on Saturday. So we were without our belongings for almost half of our visit. While WOW air reimbursed us 133.48 for purchases they refused to reimburse us for the 70.00 we paid to check in the misplaced bag. After multiple challenges they held firm to their no baggage fee refund policy because our luggage was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.
I had an extremely pleasant journey. The premium economy product outranks other airlines on that route. The staff are very friendly and attentive seats extremely comfortable and go back quite far and the pillow and blankets are soft and cosy. The food was outstanding and the entertainment plentiful. There is also free basic wifi for whatsapp and email and works really well.
This was my return flight of my trip in the USA. From Europe to the USA we had an Airbus A380 which was modern and quite enjoyable to fly. My return flight was on a Boeing 747. The aircraft was quite old with seats which werent so comfortable but at least fully OK. The flight was good cabin crew were friendly sometimes absent in the cabin and not very happy when you asked them something. The food was OK not gastronomic but acceptable in an economy class. We had delays of 35 minutes by landing so the flight were quite on time though that the longest delay was due of an engine problem. I recommend British Airways even for short flights if you book early and fares not too high than for longer ones. One reason more is that connections in Heathrow are easy when you have two BA flights transfer done in 35mins.
Telephone customer service was unhelpful. I booked a late flight 615pm from Melbourne to Brisbane due to commitments however the airline moved me onto the 1230pm flight 32 cheaper than I paid. I required a refund as they advised they could not book me on a later flight. The refund will be processed within 34 weeks. Throughout my phone call I asked the customer service representative why can i still book the 6.15pm flight online price is now 169 She advised me that the flight is unavailable and will not be flying on this day. How can Tigerair or third party providers continue to sell flights for a future flight which is 7 weeks away knowing that it will not be running for a cost of 169 This seems like a dishonest money making scheme as they will continue to transfer passengers who have paid 169 for the 6.15pm flight to the 12.30pm flight which is currently selling for 69. Tigerair is currently making 100 per passenger who books the 6.15pm flight as this is a preferable flying time only to be moved onto an unpopular timeslot.
We were scheduled to fly from Merida on 28Feb 2022 flight AM 829 and connect to Delta flight DL605 to Minneapolis. AM 829 was 2 hours late causing us to miss our connection to DL605. We were told we would have to return to the main ticketing counter to find a solution to our problem. Going back out of the security area and waited to talk with an agent. When we finally spoke with an agent we were told we would have to wait until the next day to get the same flight. Asked if we could take a different flight to anywhere in the USA then to Minneapolis was met with a resounding NO How about a hotel voucher NO How about a voucher for a new COVID test because AeroMexico delayed our travel NO Several other passengers were in the same situation. One person did talk someone into a hotel voucher but we were refused. Our decision was to get out of Merida right away and make it to Mexico City so we did not have to deal with the endless no responses we were encountering from AeroMexico. AeroMexico did get us boarding request with Delta not boarding passes but offered us nothing for our extra lodging costs and inconvenience. They said Delta would determine if our COVID test were still valid. We were lucky to find seats on DL605. We had paid for Comfort but had to settle for Main 1. If I was Delta I would cut my alliance with AeroMexico yesterday. Local flyers said this was typical for your punctuality.
Dusseldorf to Boston. Never fly this airline. The worst by far. They cancel flight and move people to different flights with different destinations. Then you are on your own. You have to buy new ticket to wherever your destination is. They hassle you to collect what you paid. No apologies or regret in their actions.
The staff were not friendly or even helpful. A pregnant lady beside me asked for help with her carry on and the answer was if you cant carry it dont bring it on board. My husband asked for an extra pillow and he was told only one pillow per passenger. The lady beside my daughter was not given food and when she asked for it the flight attendant answered in a loud voice I did ask you which did not happen. So dont fly this airline unless you have no other choice.
I booked and bought an online ticket for a multi destination 6 week trip that took me from Bangkok to London Angola London Nigeria London and back to Bangkok. Before purchase I called the British Airways service number on website and asked if I needed to change rearrange dates with this ticket was that OK was told yes but have to pay a 150 fee and nothing else a little steep but OK. I further checked extras would be against the Visa card used to purchase the ticket of course was the reply. BA make you pay to book a specific seat now. The trip started okay but the aircraft used on the Bangkok flight very worn and old anyway got through to 3rd leg visiting Nigeria for 12 days business and looked like I could arrange to come home earlier fired up the BA app on internet roaming service to find its not possible to rebook on the APP as indicated not given any local number to call search out possible BA numbers to find they no longer have an office in Nigeria and get onto what transpires to be their call centre in India. Operator checks there is space on an earlier flight but then announces he has to check the additional cost to come up with an extra of 1000. I decline this option and explain the 150 as advised actually APP says change cost is 0. Later BA call centre call back and say they can offer a reduced cost hustling for business like they are haggling in an open market however for this option it would not be possible to take payment by Visa. It had to be paid in cash to only a single bank branch in Abuja during bank open hours some 6 hours and 300Kms away. By now I had readjusted to fly on the original dates fuming with BA over the mis sold flight and ridiculous impractical conditions they try and enforce. Taking this up with BA complaints takes 2 month to elicit a first response to be dealt with on one sided website. They do not take responsibility for the advice given over the phone will not acknowledge any shortcomings of their APP refusing to discuss it and failure to advise on their very special conditions that apply to their Nigerian flights. My return flight to Bangkok on a tired sunken seat with bent worn and distorted table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of BA cabin staff too short and rotund to be able to reach and close the overhead lockers before take off and persuading a bemused passenger out his seat to do this for them that this is not the former flag carrier but a worn out and low cost discount carrier. Never again.
I booked my flight through bravofly to go to Mallorca. I loged on to the website to check in online for the flight about 18 hours before the flight. The check in system was not working. I kept trying throughout the day without any luck. The company stated checkins are open up to 6 hours before flight. This caused me frustration because I didnt even know If I would be able to board since I couldnt provide my advance passenger information. When I arrived at thw check in I got charged 45 for handluggage because the limit is 5kg. I took my laptop in hand and gave them the bag. But really 5kg A womans purse weighs more than that. They can at least have the minimum decency to say no hand luggage allowed so we can milk you the remainder of the ticket price that we removed to appear competitive. I never have checked hand luggage weight and never had a problem and I always pack the same amount of clothes for a 3 day buisness trip. You can always say it is my fault for not checking but even if I had the limit you are informed of this after buying the ticket unless you search online leads one to the only option of buying bag allowance. The just feels like you are being scammed even if they can claim they have no wrongdoing and the customer is blaimed for not checking thoroughly. Just to mention at this point that it was not my money I was spending so I couldnt care less about that. It is their attitude that they can pull any trick up their sleeve and get away with it. It does seem to be the case though. What was also interseting was the smirk of the lady that was at the desk as if she was pocketing the money obviously not the case. The seat I was given was on the aisle so at least I had some leg room. Given that it was an economy flight everything regarding food and entertainment was heavily priced but that is expected. The flight was delayed by about an hour plus the time it took me to retrieve my overweight manpurse resulted in me being delayed for my pickup that we had arranged with my colleague for another couple of hours. Overall it caused me a 3 hour delay. Communication with the staff was minimal so it was as if they didnt exist. It is by far the worst company I have travelled with.
I travelled with same carry on with indigo and had no issues but SpiceJet charged me 3000 Rs. Almost 100 of ticket price. I am never taking this flight. The guy at the Jaipur counter did not listen to my explanation. Avoid this flight. Unless you want to get surprised by extra cost.
Dubai to Bangkok via Mumbai. I believe in you get what you pay for I take monthly trips from Dubai to Bangkok andI always fly nonstop with another airline. I saw the flight I wanted with Jet Airways was only 350 USD or so round trip with one stop in Mumbai. I figured why not give it a chance As soon as I got on the plane I knew it was going to be rough. The seats are horrible They are worn out and filthy. The staff is very attentive I will give them credit for that. Once I got to Bangkok my bag was pretty much destroyed like they threw it around for fun. Fast forward to me leaving Bangkok back to Dubai. Again the seats are worn and filthy. They scheduled my connecting flight thru Mumbai way to close to the time we would land from Bangkok. I run through the airport and I make it to the gate. When I hand my boarding pass to the person it doesnt scan. They had cancelled me off that flight and put me on a later one. I asked why did you cancel me if Im here That in turn made me be late for a meeting I had in Dubai. I asked since you guys changed my trip can I at least be compensated with an upgraded seat No response of course I was told to follow a gentleman for new boarding pass for the next flight. We walked all the way back through Mumbai airport and then I was told to wait at security while he brings me a new boarding pass. He comes back 10 minutes later and says its the same gate as before. So now I have to walk all the way back through the airport again. I didnt have an upgraded seat not even an emergency exit row for a little more space. When I finally get to Dubai I wait for almost 40 minutes for my NEW bags. When they arrive guess what It is destroyed as well. When I get home and open my bag my clothes were covered in shampoo lotion and everything else I had in my checked bag. I swear they were running it over with a cart or something. All in all I would rather walk from Dubai to Bangkok before I would ever use this airline again. Their prices are extremely low and now I see why. Just remember the inflight entertainment is a joke. The only movies or shows that would play were Bollywood ones. Everything else it would go back to the main screen and wouldnt play. I tried on 3 different devices so apparently it is on their end not mine.
Cape Town to Rio de Janeiro via Luanda. Flight to Luanda check in at Cape Town Airport was smooth and quick. The flight departed on time. Boarding was organised and friendly. The aircraft was spotlessly clean and felt in good condition. The entertainment system worked well but had very limited selection. The meal served was tasty and sufficient. Cabin crew were somewhat robotic and stone facedperhaps the language barrier. My seat had very good legroom and was comfortable. Luanda Airport really let the side down. Terrible place badly organised with very limited food and drink options and too few toilets. The flight to Rio departed late mainly due to Luanda Airport slowing everything down. The flight to Rio was similarly of good standard. Nothing exceptional but in all it was good.
Everything written above about Condor is true. The plane was old the food service was so small that it was mostly laughable. The customer service over the phone was pathetically bad. Checkin was not successful online there was a risk that it should have been done during the 2hour changeover at the Frankfurt airport Never again. And it wasnt even cheap for the same price you can get decent things from Air France or Lufthansa.
Ljubljana to Zurich. Firstly Ljubljana airport is terrible. Badly trained staff unfriendly. Toilets are very dirty. Flight 2 hours delayed without any information. There is no Information desk so questions arent possible. Never again will use this airline. Its even worse than the budget airlines and thats difficult.
Paid for direct flight January 27 2020 from Santa Clara to Saskatoon. Flight delay of 2 hours Arrived at airport. When boarding began heard from other passengers that we were going to Montego Bay. When in Montego Bay pilot stated we will be going to Windsor Ontario to fuel up. Arrived in Saskatoon at 440 in the morning nearly 6 hours late. Sunwing does not give customers accurate information and provides very poor service. We would never recommend Sunwing. Buyer beware
This airline cancelled three flights in a row. They made us go to a terrible resort overnight then come back to the airport just for the flight to be cancelled and service say they dont open until 7am and they couldnt get us on any flights that day. After this trying to get our money back has been a nightmare. Still no refund given.
Apia Samoa to San Francisco with Fiji Airways. Seats were ridiculous There was no room to move at all. Approx 2.5 feet between my own seat back and the seat back in front of me. 11 hours in the middle and I could barely walk. The staff were professional courteous and helpful. This was my 3rd time to the South PacificAsia and it was the most uncomfortable trip of all. We were simply sardines.
WDHFRA with my wife. Big mess to reconfirm the flights in WDH computer breakdown incompetent employees not willing to help. Checkin OK and quick very lousy lounge at WDH no priority boarding chaotic rush to the aircraft. Aircraft standing there the whole day and no traffic but able to depart 30 mins late. Worst cabin service ever experienced no meal choice available slow and incompetent staff. My wife went to the galley to ask gently for something to drink together with the meal the chief FA came to our seats and scold us you have to be patient we have other things to do. Were treated like disobedient pupils no need to say after meal there was no more service and entertainment system at my seat was defective. Rude wakeup in the middle of the night 2.5 hours before landing for what they call a breakfast. Incredible and a great pity for the wonderful and friendly country of Namibia next time we fly again SAA despite of having to fly via JNB. We traveled last time in 2006 with Air Namibia and things have turned from good average to lousy.
Never use this airline. The flight programmed at 3 pm was postponed twice without information to finally be canceled. They send you to a hotel with no rooms available without any information when a flight would be available. I had to work and travel the day after. I lost everything This airline is the highly recommended not to use never even if price is very low.
I paid a large amount of money for what is a 6 hour flight from Tokyo to Bangkok. The very least they can do is include food I should not have to pay extra just to get a meal. Ive been on many flights and every single one includes food if longer than 5 hours. Terrible.
Glasgow to Melbourne via Dubai with Emirates. On the GLADXB sector the Boeing 777300ER was just 11 months old clean tidy and with impressive IFE. We had chosen the back of the plane where the window seats are in twos and would recommend this for couples it felt spacious and comfortable. The 343 layout of the rest of the economy cabin did look very cramped however. These seats at the back put you close to the toilets but did not find it to be an issue however you are at the back of the queue for meals which meant I was lucky to get my choice FA had to go and find me a chicken tandoori. The long Dubai to Melbourne sector had us in seats A and B of the 343 economy layout this felt much more cramped and uncomfortable and will avoid in future. The A380 was slightly older with the older style of IFE which was not altogether functional my partners screen was buggy and only one headphone worked. There was not much staff could do about this except change her seat which would have meant splitting us up. The A380 had WiFi but it was so slow as to be practically unusable for anything more than sending WhatsApp messages. Food on both flights was excellent both for me normal diet and my partner vegetarianlactoovo. The crew made a few soft drinks runs but could have been more frequent particularly on the longer sector. There are complimentary beverages on Emirates but the crew seemed so busy you didnt feel welcome to order one outside the meal runs. The crew were mainly pleasant but could have been a bit more welcoming and enthusiastic as I said above you didnt really feel overly welcome or waited upon its not their main job but its nice to be looked after. Checkin staff at Glasgow were helpful pleasant and efficient but we were caught unawares by the strict weighed at checkin 7kg carryon limit. Unfortunately our biggest issue was with some damage to my partners case which meant that it could no longer be rolled and will need to be repairedreplaced. Emirates were initially helpful sending me a form to fill out and asking for photos etc but 3 weeks later we have heard nothing. In this respect Dubaibased customer service needs to improve.
Flight 718 Dec 15th 2022 took 27 hours to get from Orlando to New Haven Ct due to Malfunctions related to the aircraft. I slept in the airport. Then my return fight 719 Dec 28th 2022 New Haven was cancelled without any notice all monies refunded. I was told I couldnt get a flight out of New Haven until Dec 31st. After talking to an Agent I was told they refunded the Ticket because of the 27 hour delay in Orland that included my return trip was Cancelled and I was never notified of this. The Agent apologized and was sadden because she could not correct the Cancellation so I was stuck again Last year 2021 the Christmas flight Orlando to New Haven Ct round trip went well. This year the Round trip delay is 4 plus days. All in all Avelo is providing a service for a cost you have to decide if its worth it.
This is the first time I am travelling from Air India Express from Dubai to New Delhi and my first experience is bad. Firstly the flight is delayed by 2 hrs. All the crew members are talking to the passengers in Hindi. Even though my mother tongue is hindi this is really unprofessional. Flight looks very old. My seat number is 31F. I will try to choose Air India express as my last option. I guess Air India should get privatised now.
Ho Chi MInh City to Brisbane via Taipei. Check in slow lounge okay in SGN. Flight to Taipei was better than the one to Brisbane. Food was OK wine very good crew attentive. Fully flat beds but didnt use them on this afternoon flight. Infinity lounge at TPE was very crowded and adequate re offerings but nothing special. Brisbane flight overnight and not flat beds so sleep was not wonderful. Crew again top notch food bland and in large quantities wine list the same as earlier flight. Asked for champagne with breakfast they had run out and was offered a white wine which I declined. Bags off very fast only waited two minutes at the carousel. Very dedicated crew made both flights comfortable however food was hit and miss.
Ridiculous Policy and worse airline that Ive been ever experienced. Food was very bad. Onboarding was very unorganized and late. Delay on both departures
Take off was 2140 and my food was served approx 2330. Kids meals were awful and my children wouldnt touch it. The meal service finished approx 45 mins later lights went off only for the lights to come on 2 hours later to serve a pastry. So we are wide awake and another 2 hours to go in the flight. Finally landed in Doha exhausted. Thankfully the crew and service were more prompt on the next leg but my food was awful. Kids were served egg wrap and as there were no meat choices when crew came to us I was served a veg dish which was awful. Doubtful I will choose to fly Qatar again.
Mauritius to London Heathrow with Air Mauritius. Staff are perfectly friendly. Food is poor with the business class meal very average. No snacks available during the flight except the packets of pretzels which the staff went to get me from economy class. Entertainment is poor. This route uses the old style entertainment system which plays a set number of films about 4 English language options on loop. The seat is average old style business class angled flat but with nice cushions. Route and timing is good on time and direct to London is great.
Okinawa to Taipei. I checked in at the counter and they charged me for extra luggage. I paid then the check in staff tells me that I will not be able to board the flight due to a technicality. I asked for a refund on my luggage. I was told to contact the airline. I did. They argued with me. Gave me a lot of attitude. Finally the informed me that they would issue a refund for the luggage charge in the next 4 months. They told me that they are unable to confirm my refund by email.
Worst airline ever. I paid for the sandwich but i didnt receive any. They should include meal in the ticket cost since it was over 4 hours of travel. It reached the destination delayed by 1 hour. Also my luggage was damaged. I dont recommend this airline.
Pros Food is OK and most crews were somewhat attentive. Cons less selection of movies and music Issue I usually made multiple trips every two hours to restroom unfortunately EVA air assigned me the window seat and I couldnt change it during checkin. After took off I realized that there were some aisle seats not been taken so I requested a flight attendant whether I could change my window to aisle. She told me that there was no aisle seat available. I ended up begging my neighbor passengers for five times to go to restroom. Most of the times they were sleeping and I really hated doing that. It would be better if the flight attendant provided me the reason why she could not assign me an aisle seat when some are available instead of rudely denying and walking away.
Southwest should be ashamed of themselves for leaving customers stranded while randomly canceling thousands of flights at the busiest of travel times and then instead of trying to assist those customers proceeding to cancel 70 percent of their flights for the next week while other airlines are doing everything they can to get back on track and to claim their customer service lines are fully staffed is an outright lie. I called numerous times only to be put on hold for long wait times and then disconnected. Used to be great ... have become a pay to play that screws its customers every chance it gets to falsify cash flow records and cook their books. They have certainly lost a loyal customer. Its hard to rate the services individually as they just can leave flights and customers had no flight experience to rate.
I made two flights onboard a new A320 between GYE to GPS and the new A320 was really nice seats were very comfortable. The crew members were kind and polite food was good standard airlines food not a grande cuisine . The aircraft coming from Quito and Guayaquil was very clean for the return flight after a short stop over at Baltra airport The crews attitude was very friendly .
Munich to Doha with Qatar Airways and the crew on the Boeing 787 was friendly and efficient. The food looked good nicely presented but soup was cold and fish was dry. The best was the Haagen Dazs ice cream. The entertainment system was limited with not many new movies classical music in audio is close to nonexistent. No information was given about a change of the aircraft instead of the A350 we got the B787 instead of the confirmed seat in the middle section of business class the new seat is in the noisy last row At checkin I was told that the luggage will be tagged only to the last destination of Qatar flights which was Sydney. They would not tag luggage to connection flights such as Virgin Australia who are not part of oneworld alliance
Flew Turkish Airlines from Singapore to Istanbul. Booked this as the price dropped presumably as a result of terrorist activity in Turkey and the region. Checkin at Singapore very efficient. Boarding very quick. Comfortable seats for the twelve hour flight great hidef seat back tv with good movie selection but not as good a selection as Emirates. Great crew all Turkish polyglot crew unlike other airlines whose crew are like the United Nations. They were so generous with the free alcohol that I slept most of the way the flight was at 23.30 so cannot comment on the food. Will fly Turkish again.
Worst airline ever check in system is the worst and they will ask you to pay a lot. Theyre taking your money for the worst service. Crew are rude and wouldnt explain it. I wouldnt recommend it for everyone. Attached additional charges to pay because when you check in online you have to pay and when you check in with them at the airport even with 3hrs before you will have to pay 3x. My first time and definitely my last time with this kind of service.
Medellin to Lima via Bogota. This company needs to be put out of business. This companys business model is completely based on theft and extortion. I arrived with a bag that fit the description of the limits on my ticket purchased from Kiwi. Since I could not print out my tickets the night before I reserved them online for what was supposed to be less of a charge. Not only did they make me pay twice to print out my tickets once online and once in person at the MDE airport they even acknowledged the fact that I even booked this service the day before but that I would still have to pay an additional fine. And that they would only print out one ticket and that I would have to pay again to get on my connecting flight in Bogota But it gets much worse than this. Even though I made sure that my big fit the size and weight limits put on my ticket the dimension and weight requirements were different at the door. They did not express empathy or understanding of this fact and simply made me pay the fine of 75 USD more than the ticket price just to bring a normal backpack designed to fit as a carryon on board. Since I had no choice but to comply I paid the 75 was given a receipt and was assured that my connecting flight would accept the receipt as payment for my luggage. However once I went in line to get my ticket for my connecting flight at the next airport they informed me that I would not only have to pay the printing fee again but that I would also have to pay a heftier 125 fine to bring my carryon backpack to Lima. This price is absolutely unheard of. I have flown on AirAsia RyanAir and the fees that VivaColombia charged me were nothing short of robbery. In other words the company lied to me told me that I would only have to pay one fee forced to pay double fines for printing tickets and refused to accept the size and weight requirements listed on the ticket I purchased. This company is an absolute embarrassment to the people of Colombia the airline industry and is a model of what a terrible company looks like who values money more than the customer. . Personally until this change is noticeable I will never use this company again.
I booked my Air India Express flight from Kuala lumpur to Chennai on 3rd Feb 2016 at 11.30 pm and I was informed at 6 pm that flight was late by one hour. Later when I reached airport they informed the flight is delayed by 4 hours. Since I had connected flight from Chennai to Coimbatore at 6.30 on 4th Feb I requested for assistance of staff in Kuala Lumpur they took my data of connecting flights and promised me that alternative connecting flights will be arranged and informed to Officials in Chennai. But flight took only at 5 am on 4th Feb and it landed at 6.30 am in Chennai airport. My connecting flight had already departed the airport. When I required the Air India staff they ran away as their duty is over and no one was there in the airport. Never seen such an experience in my life. I have to book a new connecting flight and flew to Coimbatore.
In March 2020 my flight from Mahe to Mauritius was cancelled by Air Mauritius so its 17 months and I am still fighting for my refund. In their last email I was informed that I have to wait till January 2022 and then they will make their decision regarding my refund. I am not going to risk my money booking my flight with Air Mauritius again.
Airport staff this time were as efficient as you can get. Check in was kind of a slow process and they do need to learn how to prioritize their lines. Not once did we get a final check in or express check in at the check in counters. By the time I got to immigration we had 20 minutes until our flight left luckily enough the immigration let us cut the line. It didnt really matter because we arrived at the gate to basically stand there for 15 mins. Our departure was at 10.50am we are boarding at 10.50am. Onboard the aircraft my seat was cracked. Staff were quite rude constantly asking us to sit down while they played who to blame for the delay. Captain didnt say anything which I found rude. It was only after 30 minutes that he informed us we missed our time slot. Cabin was quite hot. I never seen such picky flight staff in my life asking anyone who moved seats why they were moving and to proceed back to their seat. For dinner there was no stock left no meal no sandwich no coke. We finally arrived in Cebu only an hour late. You get what you paid for and I paid only 120.00 for two tickets.
We travelled with Smart Wings to Tenerife recently only to have an 11hr delay outbound the plane was past its best to say the least. Unhelpful crew with mostly sour faces. The return journey wasnt much better we took off on time but ended up being diverted to Lyon due to another technical problem. Ended up with a two hr delay and change of plane. Definitely wouldnt fly with them again.
Manila to Puerto Prinsesa. Flight was not delayed our flight was 555 we were boarded 520. But the aircraft didnt leave until 620. While waiting inside the aircraft I can hear was how annoyed the cabin crews at the back. The crews were not friendly. There was little legroom. Im writing this review while waiting for my delayed flight going back to manila.
La Paz Lima Caracas. The aircraft were immaculate flights on time and food reasonable. However the inflight entertainment suffered a lack of planning loads of shorts and then starting a 92 minute movie with only 60 minutes until landing is not very smart. But the biggest problem with this airline is that they tend to cancel flights without telling you. I met three people besides myself who experienced this one had to drop a country from her holiday plans another had to buy tickets on another airline. When I heard this I checked and saw my flight was no longer showing on Amadeus or on the LAN website but it was not until my 3rd inquiry over 5 days at various LAN offices that LAN admitted they had cancelled my flight on the second occasion they even gave me a printout which included my cancelled flight If you are flying this airline I suggest you check your flight status often.
London Gatwick to Antigua return. The charge to reserve your seat is extortionate The check in staff at Gatwick were miserable to the point of rudeness. The inflight meal was appalling and the pre arrival mealsnack was a joke. British Airways is run by bean counters who want to charge extricate the maximum amount of money for the minimum expenditure. No wonder British Airways are slipping down the ratings lists.
Bali to Kuala Lumpur. This company is an absolute trap they have many hidden costs and have zero flexibility or compassion for their customers. They may seem like the cheapest option however I have flown with them twice and both time with their costs they have turned out to be the most expensive option by far charging 24 per kilo if you want to check in additional baggage even online. I urge you to avoid this company at all costs the worst company I have ever had the unfortunate experience of transacting with ever.
I flew from Santiago de Chile to Punta Arenas. Sky Airline offers only Economy Class seating. The fight from Santiago to Punta Arenas makes a regular but short stop in Puerto Montt. For a lowcost airline compared to South American standards Sky Airline was quite good. The crew was attentive throughout the flight. The pilot even mentioned when we flew over the famous Torres del Pain national park in Patagonia. We were served drinks on both legs of the flight. Seat comfort is okay for short to medium distances. Also they dont have any IFE or wifi connection available on their Airbus fleet. However I would definitely fly again with Sky Airline since its great value for money.
Paris Orly to PointeaPitre. Overall good experience decent food friendly service on the inbound flight. Outbound all of the crew disappeared at night difficult to get something to drink. Some security concerns upon landing in Paris. Crew didnt check the cabin at alltwo teens sleeping in lie flat position until touchdown No one to wake them up no one to remind them to put their seat in an upright position never saw that before . Seats are ok but angled lie flat.
18 May 2013 PEKFNJ JS 152. 25 May 2013 FNJPEK JS 151. Not as bad as expected. Standard level of service modern aircraft Tu204 similar to 757 or 320 series not any worse when comparing with some airlines of Europe or Asia. Aircraft and interior were in mint condition on time service no problems at all.
Perth to Newcastle via Dubai. I booked a return flight from Perth to Uk due to unforeseen circumstances I had to miss my first flight. However later when I finally arrived to UK then I realised they had already cancelled my return flight. Leaving me having to buy my tickets again. I rang Emirates and they said thats how the airline policy works and nothing they can do about it. And suggest I rebook soon if I want the same flight back. Or contact my flight agency to see what they can do.
This airline is horrible. This was my husband and my first time to Portugal and first time flying with SATA Airlines. Not only was our flight delayed 9 hours but when we finally got on we took off and circled around then landed back in Lisbon. The reason for the first delay was because of technical issues. Knowing there was a problem they still put us on the plane. When we landed 15 min later back in Lisbon there were fire trucks surrounding us. By the time we got off the plane and collected our bags it was 12am Saturday morning. Mind you our flight was supposed to take off originally at 130pm Friday. Not only did they tell us we had to sleep at the airport because they could not put us in a hotel they didnt even offer a pillow or blanket to anyone. We finally took off Saturday afternoon on a different aircraft to the Azores after spending 31 hours at the airport. We are still fighting with them to get our money back on the flights we then had to purchase on a different airline just to get back to Lisbon. They are by far the worst experience ever. I highly recommend not flying with them at all cost.
Chennai to Salalah via Sharjah. Worst airline ever travelled flight delayed by half an hour in Chennai because of that I lost my connection flight to Salalah. Had to wait 10 hours for next connecting flight didnt even provided a provision stay. This is second time it happened like this with this airline. Ill never use this airline again.
TokyoHaneda to Bangkok then to Jakarta onboard their Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 right on the 63rd anniversary of this airline. The TokyoBangkok leg was sublime the crews in Thai traditional uniforms treated us like they were happy to have all passengers onboard this very special occasion. They were friendly professional and always present throughout the flight. The seat was comfortable but they could have added some extra legroom since my leg touched the seat in front of me when sleeping in a relaxedreclined position and for the record I am only 5 ft 6. Ground staff at Haneda were friendly and professional as well. The positive trend was continued by the IFE system and the food I received on the flight. Not only did I receive two meals but they were absolutely exquisite although their rice could use a tad more seasoning to make it perfect. The IFE system on the A330 contained more selections than their 777s with the same good level of responsiveness and excellent layout. It was the BangkokJakarta leg that brought the scores down a little bit. The ground staff at Bangkok as usual were not up to the Land of Smiles name the crews seemed to lack friendliness although they remained professional and efficient the seats were a tad too hard although had better legroom and the inflight entertainment was an old model that lacked responsiveness and often hung and crashed although it had good selections and layout. The meal served on this flight however were just as delicious as my previous 3 Thai flights. Overall in these two anniversaryedition flights there were some downsides that need improvement especially on the BangkokJakarta leg but the Thai touch has not completely vanished. I can see that theyre slowly but surely going back to its former glory.
London to Mumbai. The electrics at my seat were not working. This may have been related but the remote control that was completely broken with loose wires etc. The call button light kept coming on and off on its own. It was impossible for me to control this and at the time that I did actually want to contact the flight attendant I had to use my husbands remote control to do so. Because the connection was loose on my remote it meant that things were changing on my TV screen without me being able to control it e.g. I would press play on the screen then the program would pause or start rewinding without me doing anything. Because my remote controller was broken it would not return properly into the socket and kept pinging back out. This was annoying when you are trying to relax in your seat. The TV screen was faulty. The usual push and release button did not work I had to push the button and then just try to pull the screen it was very tough. Even the cabin crew could not release it properly. My footrest was very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own my husband had to help every time I wanted to move this. My husbands footrest was broken The charging socket at my seat did not work so I could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flight. My husbands charging socket also did not work. the flight attendant told me that this was an issue on some of the other seats in our row. This is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seatrow kept opening throughout the flight. The attendant would shut it and then it would open this happened during take off and landing as well as throughout the flight. For this level of airline and Club World seat it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipment. This return flight was the first time that I have flown business class. We have spent tens of thousands of pounds on our American Express card to earn the points required and to generate the companion voucher for us to be able to fly business class for our honeymoon. Whilst the outbound flight was great I was very disappointed with the return flight and shocked by the poor quality of the seat. The hostess tried to reset my screen which made no difference and in fact the situation got worse. Once I had tried to turn on the screen and once it the hostess had attempted a reset after that the screen just kept flicking on and off for the remaining 3.5 hrs of the flight. As you can imagine it is very annoying to have a screen flick on and off with no way of controlling it. It was impossible to turn the screen off completely.
The second time that I have booked Thomas Cook Airlines for a Ski trip and if another carrier served Innsbruck I would not use TC. Last year I couldnt book Skis seats or luggage on because the online booking system had failed it took 45 minutes on two calls to get this done so almost as long as the flight itself. This year is worse they now advertise on the online extras booking that you can add skis so several attempts bring up error message displaying a number to call for assistance followed by long hold times terrible line in some remote call centre poor understanding and communication. Eventually the assistant goes through the bag and seat reservation and then asks the dimensions of the skis something that I have never been asked She gets around this takes payment details and then disappears without trace no call back no confirmation. So I call again same process but no dimensions this time she takes payment details puts me on hold to then tell me that Skis are not permitted on the flight It is a ski flight to Innsbruck. I ask for a supervisor 20 minute hold and guess what no supervisor answers I hang up and try online chat. Again same process they agree its not a problem until they try to make payment again I am now told that they cannot confirm caring skis before departure and that if I take them to the airport they may carry them. And if they dont And no doubt at an increased cost. I am returning with Monarch and have paid 45 to bring my Skis home but cant get them there. I incorporate my review from Jan 2016 also. We all work hard to buy our holidays and all Thomas Cook can do is add stress to the process be warned Book it with another carrier dont Thomas Cook it.
Manchester to Punta Cana with Thomson Airways. We had a good outbound flight and the return was overall very good. A couple of minor irritations no seat back film guide and a curt response when asked where they were on the screen would not have been a problem except that we had one on the way to the Dominican Republic Seat pocket had not been emptied I was treated to the magazines of the previous occupant had they been to my taste I would say some issues with the cleaning at the Punta Cana end. The seats are average and not great if you are a small person. Service was good drinks then meals but the food was mediocre and the breakfast terrible no different to other charter flights I have come to expect nothing better. Despite paying a fair amount for Premium its hard to see what you get apart from more leg room and first ontooff the aircraft. The food and drinks are the same and you still get cheap plastic glasses for your drinks. TV screens are good definition but the film choice is limited and no recent releases. First time on a Boeing 787 and apart from it being slightly quieter I could not tell any difference from any other plane. I would have no problems flying Thomson again but the hype around the Boeing 787 does not transfer to the experience in my opinion.
Honestly I would never fly with them again. They changed my flight twice by a day each time as well as my return flight by 2 days. When I contacted them about this they were extremely unreasonable and gave boilerplate responses. Forget trying to get them on the phone they charge for that.
Flew Iberia Express from Madrid to Rennes. Very good punctuality we arrived 20 minutes before the scheduled time. The Immfly WiFi connection works very well. Great variety of content like films series TV programs for flights of less than three hours. The staff were very nice and helpful.
Worst flight ever. This trip was a nightmare from the early flight without water coffee food to the very cramped seats even though we paid extra room for a PLUS to the flight without any type of entertainment or wifi internet options. Ive been using Avianca for more than 20 years in this type of flight and it used to be a very different story. I will never use this airline again and Im not recommended to anyone right now
The aircraft was fully booked but the crew were energetic working fast. The food was fast served as well as drinks. I had very short time of transit but as I arrived my destination my baggage was also arrived in time which is not always the case for the moment.
We are terribly concerned and quite upset with both the quality and quantity of the onboard meals on long distance Emirates flights. In our recent experience there was only one meal served during our flight from Manchester to Dubai which lasted for 7 hours 30min. A tiny packet of pretzels was provided as a snack which was very inadequate and compares poorly to any other airline. There were also no sleeping kits provided which is highly unusual. On the Dubai to Kolkata flight duration of 4 hours the only meal provided came very late and we had to request for snacks which were tiny packets of savoury mix to fill in. Not to mention the meals they provided in both flights were frugal and by far of a poor quality in comparison to any standard airline. Desserts were horrendous. We dread boarding our already booked return flight back to Manchester.
LHRSFOLHR. Why do I keep thinking BA will improve The 747 on this route is falling to bits. Their business class configuration is terrible. Facing a complete stranger having to attempt to climb over other passenger to go to bathroom Seat narrow and table unusable for dinner unless use knee to hold it up Food on both legs awful but worse coming from SFO. Also club kitchen pathetic. IFE systems the worst of any airline. BA please travel on Emirates just once and see how it should be done. Staff on way out on upper deck very nice and attentive however on return to LHR on upper deck staff were verging on cant be bothered Served dinner during severe turbulence which you could not eat so they could get dinner finished and sit down for rest of flight. Had to go to galley to get drink as ignored call button. Then empties sat on table for two hours before I dumped them in galley. Breakfast consisted of hard fruit and greasy bacon tiny roll. Both of which left uneaten. I keep booking through blind loyalty but after Bahrain and San Fran in December decided no more. They have just got too bad.
First of all the times changed. Then we had so much trouble checking in. Then when we finally checked in we werent able to get a boarding pass. Now on the airfield they are 45 minutes too late with opening the luggage checkin counters. Their website is horrible. And they have no helpdesk or customers service that is available via the website
Notwithstanding full price tickets bought months in advance Meridiana fly changed the flight schedule for the second consecutive year thus messing up my plans and partially ruining my holiday. The average low level of customer satisfaction found on the web alerted me but I tried last year the company because of its no stop flight to Crete. Due to the above mentioned schedule change that I may suppose is caused by intentional overbooking they made me lose one day of holiday. Monitors were turned off at check in so that it was difficult to find the proper line that was interminable and badly assisted. It took more than one hour to clear it. Aircraft was not properly cleaned and seats were uncomfortable. This year despite a sharp increase in prices the trick was just the same they sold an evening ticket and pretended to reprogram us on the morning flight. The call center answers after 1520 minutes and they say they cant help. Never again on Meridiana.
Makassar to Singapore. It took more time to Checkin since theres Coronavirus concern in Singapore and they check our passport per pages because we are not allowed to visit or even transit In Singapore if you ever visit China in 14 Days A little delay for boarding. The flight attendant is nice the inflight meal taste great. Singapore Bangkok First time using A350900 and I like it the aircraft still new and so fresh The Inflight meal is good. Boarding time is great on time.
Istanbul to Denpasar Bali. This was one of those flights which unfortunately was far from the high standards to be expected of Turkish Airlines. When I checked in I found that my seat had been changed from that which I selected a couple of months earlier even though the seat configuration was unchanged. We were taken in a hot bus from the terminal to the aircraft then made to wait as we couldnt board. An hour after take off they came to take a drinks order. I chose a gin and tonic and was offered ice and lemon which I chose. Almost half an hour after that my drink came. A glass with a small piece of lemon no ice and tellingly not a single bubble in the liquid. I tasted it and suspect it was vodka and still water. I told the attendant it was obviously not gin and tonic and she said she would change it. But by now they had started serving dinner so I opted for a glass of wine guessing they couldnt get that wrong. The salmon starter was excellent. After that I had selected the pea soup and fish. But she brought me chicken kebab. She changed it. I was asked what I would like for desert and I replied that I would chose from the trolley. She said they dont do the desert trolley any more. I wonder if it doesnt fit as the aisles are so narrow it is a squeeze for two people to pass. I had some delicious ice cream then the cheese plate. The latter was so cold and the cheeses so hard they had no taste. Also I had to ask for bread or crackers to go with the cheese. Then to sleep. First problem was getting flat. Although I am average height I couldnt get my feet far enough into the feet area to lower the rest of my body on to the bed. A steward saw the problem and explained that the only way is to raise the bed half up after they have made it. Lye down on it then press the button and the bed moves me towards the foot space and my head goes flat on the pillow. Overall I did not like the seatbed. Feels like being encapsulated in a black cube. Half of one window is blocked by the side of the cube though it appears it could be cut away serving no purpose. The windows were set on dark all during the cruise meaning impossible to see clearly out of the window even though much of the 12 hour flight was in daylight. Breakfast was good and uneventful. Arrival some 20 minutes early. Priority luggage came mixed with all the other luggage. To end on something positive. The increased hydration on the B787 had a positive effect and I got off the plane feeling so much better then I normally do after long flights. And however uncomfortable I much appreciated the free upgrade my level of membership to the Miles Smiles programme entitles me to twice a year.
Dhaka to Singapore in economy class. The seat comfort staff everything was excellent. They give you hot towels menus and steel cutlery for your food which is rare in economy class nowadays. It is the best airline I have flown.
21st December 2006. My wife and I booked our flight in May 2006 and duly arrived at Gatwick for our scheduled 6pm flight. We got through baggage check in having waited over 2 hours then 90 minutes getting through security and passport control. Entered departure lounge but no information on screens about our flight. We decided to go to gate 34 which was printed on our boarding pass and met all the other travellers but no Air Zimbabwe staff or representatives in sight. It was only when a fellow passenger got through to Air Zimbabwe London on her mobile phone that we were told the flight had been cancelled for technical reasons .We had to go through passport control and baggage reclaim as if we had just arrived at Gatwick and then join a huge queue of weary travellers at the Air Zimbabwe agency to see what was going on. It would have taken hours to be seen so we reluctantly went home. On the 22nd December we made 50 plus calls to Air Zimbabwe Gatwick but whoever eventually picked up the phone just put the receiver down without saying anything Eventually Air Zimbabwe London answered and promised to call me with information that day which they did and informed me categorically that we were on the11am flight on Saturday 23rd December. We duly arrived at Gatwick at 6am and waited for the Air Zimbabwe check in to open. By 9am no sign of any check in so more frantic calls to Air Zimbabwe Gatwick and London. Gatwick office were not answering and London were closed for the weekend Another traveller got hold of Air Zimbabwe Harare and was told there was a flight at 5.30 that day. Eventually an Air Zim check in opened at 2.15pm and literally hundreds of people queued many more than the plane could carry Scores of people jumped the queue and mayhem ensued. Eventually the airport security announced that the flight was for those who had not travelled on the 21st December and anyone else would not fly that day You can imagine the impact that had on those with tickets to fly that day. Eventually we got to the departure lounge and to our gate for boarding. An hour later an Air Zimbabwe spokesman announced the crew had been delayed and would be with us soon. An hour later they arrived in ones and twos and eventualy we boarded the aircraft only to be told by the captain that the baggage had yet to be loaded We eventually took off at 10.30pm after spending over 16 hours at Gatwick at our second attempt to get to our destination .Consequently we will never ever fly Air Zimbabwe again and urge other would be passengers to think again .
Air China canceled my flight which was the only nonstop flight between Beijing and Datong without any particular reason and rebooked me on the same flight the following day so I had to cut back my itinerary in Datong. I arrived at Beijing Capital Airport very early in the morning much earlier than recommended by my Beijing hotel concierge to find that the terminal checkin area was super crowded. Many customers looked very confused about selfcheckin as ones were required to print boarding passes at checkin kiosks and then to repeat the same process to print luggage tags at the bag drop area. I was able to print my boarding pass but the luggage tag machine could not read my passport and no staff was found for help. After roughly one hour running around I finally found a special checkin area tucked away on the other side of the terminal where I could check my luggage and rushed to make my flight. Inflight staff were nice but there was no IFE. Despite all of the above I still recommend the airlines as my flight departed and arrived ontime. Also this was not the first time I use Air China and my experience was that their pilots consistently executed very smooth takeoffs and landings.
People dont book flights with Sunwing Airlines I had a flight from Mexico to Toronto with a delay of 12 hours. My flight originally was booked for 14.30 but we left Mexico at 02.00am arrived just in the morning didnt go to the work and didnt receive any compensation Very very bad service
Chennai to London Heathrow with British Airways. OK service and flight but sunlight through the tinted windows was an issue as there are no blinds on the aircraft. I understand some airlines are now coming up with solutions but this is a design flaw on the 787 on a long daytime flight you cant cut out the sunshine just lower its intensity. Seat layout is poor so almost all seats you will be either needing to climb over someone or have someone climbing over you. Not up to standard. The lounge in Chennai was also poor.
Sadly flying British Airways is no longer about a great experience it is a seat on a flight which you pay a lot of money for. We had a number of issues that we tried to get resolved via Customer Services but were told they couldnt do anything until our journey had ended We were very disappointed with this approach and their inability to address our issues during our journey. BA staff at Heathrow told us the wrong information about reclaiming our baggage causing big issues the plane was overly hot on both legs of the flight and we were told by cabin crew on both flights this is a known problem on these older planes. The breakfast on our return flight wasnt fit for consumption an ice cold hard croissant after 7 hours of no food Really poor service and even worse customer services.
Air France was absolutely splendid. Flew from Vancouver to Munich via Paris. We had no issues they made this long travel time a breeze. The food was great seats were comfortable. Moreover when anxiety got the best of me due to an airport issue in Paris the Air France ladies took me in and took care of me until I was able to calm down. It helped my panic attack immensely and at that point they did not even known that we were flying with them. Offered us seats and water etc. Cannot thank them enough.
First time I have flown with Qatar Airways and Im blown away by the quality of the aircraft and service. The cabin crew were extremely attentive and friendly. Subbayal was looking after me took the time to introduce himself explain the menu and constantly check if I needed anything else. I will definitely be flying Qatar Airways again.
My wife and I have exclusively used Alaska Airlines for the past 15 years with great satisfaction. On the last trip in June we found they have changed They no longer provide even adequate service but dont care for their customers in the least and will lie when they get caught in bad service. I have 150000 miles and my wife has 124000 miles Both Elite and MVP customers. But they treated us poorly didnt care that we fly first class or anything I was actually threatened by a gate agent supervisor and her supervisor. Customer Service didnt care less and just ignored us. They have changed for the worst.
Barcelona to San Francisco. We were originally supposed to fly on Iberia and were put on a Level flight it was one of the worst flights ever. Attendants were rude they didnt have much food on board you had to literally grab an attendant to get anything their credit card machine worked about half of the time when asked for water they told my daughter to go to the back of the plane and get it herself. The attendants did not speak English and on and on. All the announcements were in Spanish so you did not know what was going on.
Gatwick to Denpasar via Doha. LGWDOH Boeing 7878. The seat layout and function is excellent. Food tasty and plentiful with a good selection. The cabin crew are professional with a nice balance of friendliness and service. Worth every one of their 5 stars. The only thing that is not up to their otherwise high standard is the Aspire lounge at Gatwick see my review of that for more details. DOHDPS Boeing 777 300 The Qsuite is quite the best business class offering I have travelled in. Its the only time I didnt want the flight to end. Add to that the Qatar cabin crews impeccable service then its a no brainer to book Qatar. DPSDOH B777300 Conventional 222 layout and so having been spoiled in the Q suite on the way out it was a bit of an anticlimax but its ok. The meal service on this sector seemed rushed and there was no drinks offered one had to ask for every one you wanted. I dont know if they were trying to get everybody fed asap to allow people to bed down but it didnt seem to be up to their usual high standard. DOHLGW Boeing 7878 Back to their usual high standard
Nairobi to Heathrow via Istanbul. The flight from Nairobi delayed by close to one hour and I almost missed my connecting flight to London. I was travelling with 2 suitcases both of which were missing when we got to London. One suitcase was delivered 4 days later and the other is still missing more than one week down the line. The airline does not give any updates on the progress of tracing the lost baggage and refers you to a robot site that has the same update tracing continues check later for updates for seven days. It is unfortunate I had booked a return flight otherwise I am not flying Turkish Airlines again
Sydney to Gold Coast. I was severely disappointed with the service and service lady. Our flight was cancelled or to engineering or engine failure. The next flight was in 3 or more days. The service lady was quite rude and emotionless. She kept saying that she is sorry or can understand our frustration but she said it as if she doesnt care. I wanted a compensation because a full refund just isnt enough. We had booked the star hotel tickets to wet n wild dream word and movie world. We lost so much money and got no compensation. She didnt offer to let us talk to her superiors. She let down a whole family. I was in a group of 11 people and most of them were kids and we were all let down. We wasted so much money and time and everyone was disappointed and upset that they couldnt go to Gold Coast.
Disappointing experience in general. All the flights fromto Vilnius were cancelled a few months in advance due to NATO summit but wizz air pretended they never heard of this until the last minute and were even selling tickets on those dates. Their customer line is just useless they neither have any info nor they can help. I got to pay additionally from at my own cost to reschedule my flights as wizz air kept silent until the very last moment and I didnt want to lose my hotel reservations or stay without a hotel.
I booked a flight to go to my grandmas 80th Birthday and they just canceled the flight. I wanted a solution and the only thing they said was to go to their homepage. The next flight available wouldve cost 1000 CHF. They just arent good with their customer service.
Johannesburg to London via Doha. Normally I love Qatar Airways but this experience wasnt so good. When I flew LHR to JNB via DOH everything was great. The brilliant service plenty of food great entertainment system and nice aircraft. The way back was not as good. The checkin assistant at JNB was incredibly rude as he spoke to his colleague the whole time he was checking me in and looked at me in a contemptuous way. I suspect he might be employed by the airport as I had the same experience at passport control and security. The route JNB DOH was ok. The plane was nice and spacious and the seats were very comfortable. A female passenger moved next to me because the passenger behind her had placed her bare feet in full view on the first passengers armrest. No one told her to put her feet away. They ran out of beef and chicken dishes and only had vegetarian left which I refused to eat as it was dal and spinach which seemed like a bad choice for a flight. The attendants tried really hard to find alternatives and credit to them for their efforts and professionalism. The airline needs to review its meal quotas for each flight. The route DOH LGW was cramped and uncomfortable the seats didnt go back as far. The snack was a choice of pizza or pizza with chicken. I dont eat cheese but luckily a member of the cabin crew found me something else. Staff were also great on this flight. The onboard WIFI is terrible. On two separate flights I signed up for the one hour free. The WIFI wouldnt connect until the hour was up at which point it told me free WIFI was no longer an option. On the other two flights it worked ok but had periods where it wouldnt connect. Compared to Emirates Qatar Airways staff are friendlier and more obliging and they give you more food. If all Qatar Airways planes were as good as the JNBDOH route and they didnt run out of food then they would definitely be my favourite airline.
Lima to Arequipa. Most expensive budget flight Ive ever seen. Hidden fees denied entry to flight left luggage. To make a long story short there is a required fee of 45 PEN per person just to print the boarding pass at the airport. For our party it meant an additional 150 USD. We paid it anyway desperate to get to our destination. At boarding one woman began to complain loudly about the bad treatment from the staff and others joined in. My husband and a few others were barred from boarding for being too loud. Our only suitcase was paid for by my father and should have been in his name but they removed it from the flight because my husband wasnt boarding without informing anyone. So we got to the destination but the suitcase was left at the first airport. We were informed that the only way to recover it was to fly back and get it ourselves.
Kalamata to London Heathrow. No priority boarding at Kalamata. Drink and food service poorly synchronised with no predinner drink no nuts and bread served with main course. Lactoovo vegetarian special included the same tomato and mozzarella starter as on the outbound flight despite a beetroot carpaccio dish being available on the standard menu. The special main was yet again a bland overcooked pasta dish. Overall a pathetic vegetarian offering. Cabin crew did the bare minimum in Club Europe and their main priority seemed to be selling the MS stuff in economy which they were doing up until 30 minutes from landing. The Club Europe toilet was grubby. Flight landed on schedule but there was a long wait for baggage at T5.
The check in counter is slow in Dubai. The flight was also delayed. The food portions are really good although you might find the bread hard. The cabin crew didnt answer call bells they would turn it off cleverly while passing by.
My ticket was with Air France and Air France uses Vistara as a codeshare partner for the flight from COK to DEL. Air Vistara doesnt honour weight limitations. I ended up paying 150 as against stated policy of 100 for baggage up to 32 KGs. I had to shift weight from my hand baggage as Vistara only allowed 7 Kgs vs 12KGs that allowed by Air France. It was a very disappointing experience to start an international trip like this. Would not recommend Vistara for travel within India.
Los Angeles to Papeete with Air Tahiti Nui. Travelers beware Reservation agents rude and unwilling to process cancellation within 24 hours of booking and website does not allow online cancellation. Plane was very old. The seat arm rest tray table and TV monitor buttons are worn or torn. Onboard service was cold and lackluster. This airline certainly cannot compete with worldclass airlines. Fly Air France to Tahiti if you are looking for superior experience.
I am retired and fly frequently. Couple days ago May 5 I went to Tehran Int. Airport IKA to travel to U.S.A. When I arrived at the Emirate ticketing counter in order to obtain my boarding pass I experienced a bad situation which I have never had with any other airlines. The ticketing lady had a very bad attitude told me to show her my Covid test result which I did then asking for Vaccination card that I responded that I am USA citizen and there is no need to have this card which she started talking loud and being so rude finally I found my card and passed it to her. After that I was glad that the issue was resolved and now she would process my luggage. I was wrong. She laid back at her chair and doing nothing. Finally I said to her this checking takes long time please process my luggage. At the end I went to her team leader and explained her behavior. I am sure that the leader would not do anything to correct his group attitudes because all of them are the same and they do not know any better but I am sure that Emirates will lose more customers as times pass. From now on I will broadcast and pass this bad experience to my friends and relatives and telling them not to fly with Emirates.
Daraga to Manila was smooth and left ahead of schedule. Manila to Riyadh flight left ontime. Crew were amazing. Kept my Champagne glass full. Upon embarkation crew handed me some small gifts which was highly appreciated. Ticket price was very reasonable.
I had a decent experience. I was expecting the worst based on reviews since I had booked it before reading reviews. They served us every couple of hours. We were fed two meals and snacks in between. I did get tired as it was a 14 hour flight so I stood in the back for sometime and nobody complained. They had snacks and simple drinks in the back for you to self serve as well. My baggage was not lost I had no problems with overweight issues and everything went smoothly in my opinion. Things could have been cleaner I will admit. And a charging port would be great as well. Entertainment wasnt bad I watched two movies. My only other complaint was no WiFi offered.
London to Auckland via Dubai. I thought Emirates offered an extremely familyfriendly service as I was travelling on my own with my 17monthold son. They were extremely attentive throughout all of my flights. I thought the food was of a decent standard they could have offered an extended drink service but if you wanted a second or a third drink you only had to ask. Some of the flights had a velcro cover for the bassinet which I did not like as my son could easily open it but the London to Dubai leg had a zip which made me feel at ease that he was safe. The flight attendants were happy to look after my son when I needed to go to the toilet and on a couple of flights some of the attendants went the extra mile and carried my son around the plane to give me a break. They had bottled baby milk and organic baby food which was a first for me when flying with my children. On the way to New Zealand I flew to LonDubaiBaliAuckland and I preferred this to the return leg when I flew direct from Auckland to Dubai which was nearly 17 hours and I would not recommend it with a toddler. I thought the inflight entertainment was of a high standard but I could not connect to the Wifi on any of the flights. Some of the aircraft were a little tired and the seating could have done with replacing but overall I found Emirates offered a good service for a father taking his 17month son all the way to New Zealand on his own.
They cancelled my flight and sent me one email with flight change instead of flight cancellation. Usually a change is a departure time change on less than an hour this was a full threeday change or original departure date cancellation. I arrived at IST to check in not knowing my flight was cancelled from Jan 10 to Jan 13. One email with another dozen soliciting me for upgrades and other feebased items. And a threeday difference is a Jan 10 cancellation. This caused all kinds of issues downstream with my hotels had to book another flight and so on.
Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
Our luggage is lost. It was supposed to come on next flight and be delivered to us last night or else by 9am this morning. There is still no sign of it and absolutely no communication from the airline. The phone number I was given is not working. They are not responding to my emails. We have a six day holiday in San Diego and the first day is already destroyed. Well done Air Alaska. Also they were left short on restocking so the only refreshment we received on our flight was a 250ml carton of water that tasted vile. A relatively minor complaint but another example of lack of concern or regard for customers. Zero marks for customer care.
Bangkok to Vancouver via Hong Kong. Similar to my previous review I was supposed to be flying Premium Economy. However while boarding both flights I was upgraded to Business Class. Bangkok to Hong Kong on a brand new A350. Though the seat itself wasnt different from the ones on the Boeing 777300ERs the refreshed IFE alongside with the retouches of the storage space made the hard product a solid one. The flight attendants were professional. Hong Kong to Vancouver on a 9year old 777300ER. I would say the thing that stood out to me most on this flight was the cabin crew who were proactive. Catering was a big improvement from my previous trip with meals served in appropriate portions and tasted amazing Both flights departed and arrived punctually. Bags were quick to arrive and I was out of the airport within 20 minutes of arriving which is rare when flying into Vancouver.
Friendly staff tasty food comfortable seats and I got moved to a seat with more legroom on own request. Plane left on time. The plane was way too cold the blankets they provided also didnt help that much. Very unpleasant experience. Small movie selection
Worst experience. London to Toronto flight was 2 hours late which of course means the luggage didnt make the connecting flight from Toronto to LA. Call waiting time is over 90 minutes and staff claim they cannot call you back. Baggage tracking is useless and no one takes any responsibility for finding your bags. It is a disgraceful lack of service. Air Canada couldnt care less. We have another flight in 36 hours and there is a possibility we will have to get on that with no baggage. Weve seen other reviews of people experiencing the same thing we are. Its appalling. Air Canada have gone to great lengths to put automated phone services in place to avoid having staff to take ownership of these issues and get the job done.
My first time flying with Qatar and what a wonderful experience it was Despite the long flight 21 hours in the air in each direction every leg was excellent. Seats were comfortable and spacious with excellent legroom. Even on relatively short 4 hour flights there were pillows and blankets on each seat. IFE was decent with a wide selection of movies and programmes to choose from. The food was all of a high standard a good selection usually 3 choices of meals and each was tasty and filling. I was very impressed with the alcohol selection a sparkling wine rare in economy class quality red and white wine two beers and a small selection of spirits. Most impressive of all was the service the crew were friendly attentive and polite. Drink runs were regular and staff were engaging and highly professional. On one leg with few passengers the staff were wonderful constantly checking up on us offering more drinks proactively offering to make a festive cocktail in economy class and ensuring our comfortable. All flights were ontime and Doha airport was a pleasure to transit through. I was very impressed with Qatar and look forward to flying them again.
My infant daughter and I flew from Cape Town to Xian via Johannesburg and Shenzhen. Firstly I was told our baggage would go all the way to Xian which it did not but that is the fault of the rude checkin counter rep in Cape Town. My daughter and I arrived in Johannesburg and had to check in our luggage onto our connecting Air China flight to Shenzhen. In Shenzhen I was told to check my luggage in again for the last leg of our journey to Xian. However my one suit case and my daughters stroller never arrived and I later learned that it never left Johannesburg airport. I arrived home having none of my daughters clothes all her clothes at home were too small for her and to add insult to injury we are now in a 14 day quarantine. We arrived on Tuesday afternoon and were told that on Saturday it would arrive. It is now Saturday evening and still no word on its expected arrival. Utterly shocking service. On a more positive note cabin crew were friendly and helpful.
Singapore Airlines represents quality at its best food service seats entertainment. Champagne juice or water upon boarding. With book the cook I had chicken rice for lunch preceded by a satay appetizer and succeeded by cheese platter for dessert. The skybed folds out for a comfortable sleep. Service was very quick each time I pressed the call bell. Seat layout is 121. I still think Singapore Airlines business class is by far the best in the world due to wider seats that are more comfortable.
Ive flown with easyjet a few times before and never had any problems. Not on 1st June though. At least they told me via the app that my flight had been delayed from 18.00 to 20.50. albeit Id already set off for the airport. Spent nearly 5 hours in Manchester Airport. Never a pleasant experience but 5 hours Apologies from the staff at the gate and on the plane but no mention of compensation refreshments etc. Landed at Venice Airport too late for my courtesy shuttle bus or for public transport and had to get a taxi to my hotel cost 50. Got to bed so late that wasnt fit to do much the next day so day wasted. Now applying for compensation.
Nov 2023 Flight from Vancouver to Rome with stopover via Paris. We landed at the opposite end of the airport and had to dismount onto the tarmac in pouring rain. No overhead coverings to keep the passengers out of the wet and cold many passengers were rightly not expecting this and not dressed accordingly. We were crammed onto a shuttle bus and transported to the security checkpoint. Plane disembarkation to security checkpoint took about 2530 minutes. Our next flight was with Air France and the scheduled layover was 1hr 40mins. Massive lineup at the security checkpoint and were shunted to a severely understaffed overflow line. This overflow line had approx. 3 planes worth of passengers and they were being screened by 1 staff member using an old system baggage and security trays were ferried by hand no automation whatsoever. There was a free line next to us but that was exclusively for the 20 or so flight staff all other passengers were ignored. It took 1hr and 10mins to get through the security checkpoint. There were arguments with passengers and staff there were arguments with passengers and passengers as people were beginning to panic that they were about to miss their connecting flights. People were begging each other to be let through first but all were in the same situation. Other lines to our right were moving quickly again but people were expressly forbidden by staff from transferring lines nor did they offer to redirect. Once we were through we went straight to our flight gate as they were beginning to final call our names over the PA system. Keep in mind we were as efficient as the airport allowed us to be no bathroom breaks no shopping and walking as quickly as possible. Doors closed a few minutes after boarding and there were still at least 70 people in the line at the security checkpoint many of whom had now missed their flights through no fault of their own. At our departing flight from Venice to Vancouver via CDG and Seattle I had found that my PR Card was lost or stolen and denied boarding the flight saying that the USA would not let us through. Even though I had my valid PR number Passport and ID they would not let me board without the plastic card. The staff were not helpful or sympathetic and were offering bad immigration advice they were insistent that we quickly purchase a tourist travel visa to Canada online as much as we told them that was for nonresidents only and even showed them policy on the Canadian Immigration website they were insistent that was the only way they would now let us through as apparently they were now deputised as US immigration officials. We informed them that we as Permanent Residents were allowed to privately cross the USCAN border in our own vehicle and we asked them to cancel to SeattleVancouver leg of the journey and let us finish the flight in Seattle. They told us to go to the ticket desk 30 meters away and try there. Once we got to the indicated ticket desk they were confused what we were doing there and told us to go back to the Air France staff who had clearly fobbed us off and again told us they cant cancel the last leg of the trip.
LHRMUR return as experienced business travellers there are certain things we expect. We were originally flying BA until they changed the schedule meaning a loss of a days holiday unacceptable when you only have 7 so we changed to Air Mauritius which to be frank I was dreading Check in fast and efficient fast track through customs as you would expect. As a small airline the lounge is shared with other airlines. A real let down next to no food choice wine etc ok Emirates it wasnt. Once on the plane business seemed reasonably comfortable until you try to sleep the seat doesnt lie flat but sloping to the floor. Im 5ft 9 and my feet were rammed into the seat in front I didnt sleep a wink all night. Having said that food reasonable wine flowed nicely we couldnt get our TV to work my husband slept most of the way I had a very long night. Return ok lounge very nice food less appealing on the flight home very weird combinations we had 2 full dinners and afternoon tea halfway through. Got the TV to work this time but film selection rubbish.
Kiev to Chicago via Istanbul. We have used them before and it was good. This time in Septemmber it was not. We went to Ukraine and called them before buying our tickets and asked them if we had to change our date what would we need They told us just call 24 hrs before the Flight and change the date well when we called a week before to change the date they charged us 150.00 each to change it and we lost our seats that we paid over 250.00 each and they charge over 750 USD to change date. The flight was 2 hrs late with out any information to us. All the passengers had to stay in 1 small room with almost no AC or info why.
First flight on a 777 was good food good service good comfortable seats staff excellent. 2nd flight on business class A330 was poor business class seats this was a regional 330 very poor seats hardly recline at all. Dinner poor in flight movies very limited.
Seoul to Shanghai. Asiana Airlines check in counter is located at Seoul Incheon International Airport Terminal 1. A ground staff approached me when I attempted to check in at the kiosk. However the check in process wasnt successful and therefore I have to proceed to the check in counter for this purpose. Unlike certain airlines which charge for seat with extra legroom I requested for a emergency exit row and was granted. Boarding call in English Chinese and Korean laguage was made approximately 40 minutes before departure. Two row are assigned for this purpose. Special need passengers and elite frequent flyer member are given priority boarding. An A321200 with 2 class of configuration is deployed for this flight. All seats are fitted with in flight entertainment. Passengers can select movies music on demand as well as live flight path at theirs own convenience. Cabin crew are extremely friendly and courteous. A Chinese speaking crew is assigned for this flight. Flight OZ367 departed on time. In flight meal was served approximately 20 minutes after take off. Passengers were offered with two choices of dinner. In the mean time hot and cold beverages including alcoholic drink were also served The professionalism of the cabin crew is without doubts when comes into the efficiency of distribution of meal. This flight will not be smooth and comfortable without theirs dedication and hardwork.
Boston to Lisbon return via Ponta Delgada. Left Boston with a delay as has been the norm for the last few years The flight to Lisbon was uneventful of note the way SATA boards their flights instead of calling the passengers by class everyone camps right at the gate and so the process becomes a nightmare similar to a herd of bison on a stampede The real fun begins on my return to Boston where I had to arrive no later than October 20th at 9 pm. I got to the airport at 10 am for my flight scheduled to leave Lisbon at 105 pm on October 20th. My bag was checked in my boarding pass handed to me and then I was informed that the flight was 5 hours behind without an explanation I told the SATA representative that I was going on call at 10 pm and had to be in Boston before that She sent me over to their sales counter where I explained the whole thing again. She was kind enough to route me to a TAP flight leaving Lisbon at 1245 to Newark where I would then fly to Boston on JetBlue and assured me that my luggage would be taken care of. Upon my arrival in Newark I could not find my bag so I thought they maybe I would get in when I arrived in Boston. To my dismay I got to Boston and could not find my bag anywhere I contacted SATA TAP JetBlue to no avail I got an email from TAP and JetBlue apologizing for the incident and informing me that they would try to locate my bag. I spend most of Saturday and Sunday calling SATA in Lisbon Ponta Delgada and Boston being given contradictory information stating that it was not their problem because I flew TAP and JetBlue. I explained to the persons that I handed my bag to a SATA employee and had a baggage claim to prove it That was of no use. The folks in the US basically told me to get lost because it was not their problem even though I have been flying SATA for almost 20 years My brother in Lisbon spent hours at the airport trying to locate the bag since in accordance with safety rules a bag cannot fly without the passenger so we were hoping that the bag was lying somewhere in Lost Found in Lisbon. After several hours he was told that they could not help him. I kept calling my agent SATA TAP JetBlue without any luck. On Monday October 23 I got a phone call from Logan Airport Lost Found letting me know that my nag was found on the SATA carousel and luckily it had my contact info on the pocket so they were able to contact me so I could come and get my bag I did go back to Logan to get it and to my surprise they were right the bag flew on my original SATA flight unaccompanied was never opened or checked to make sure it did not pose a threat to the safety of the other passengers. Even with the baggage tag SATA was unable or unwilling to locate and deliver the bag to me After all in this day and age where unfortunately so many horrible things happen all the time I cant fathom how a real airline can allow for such a breach of security. I called SATA again explained the whole thing and to my surprise there was no attempt to offer an explanation or apology and so I decided to not only publish this review but also to open a complaint for an investigation which hopefully will prevent situations that could escalate into a tragedy.
Berlin to Moscow. You have to pay for anything apart from your personal item. That includes your carryon luggage. Longest queue at checkin I have seen in years as a result of everybody having to pay for carryon or luggage that was more than 20kg. Aircraft are new and made a good impression. Cabin crew young goodlooking and charmingly helpless. Seat do not recline.
London to Johannesburg. Departure was slightly delayed by 50 mph gusts but once away the flight was the usual comfortable experience on the upper deck. Seats 53JK are some of the best as long as the galley is quiet. The dinner service was efficient and we were ready for sleep after a film. Cabin crew were pleasant and attentive. Toilets were kept clean throughout the flight. Arrival was 30 minutes behind time but baggage collection and customs were mercifully quick so we were in the SLOW lounge just 40 minutes after landing. Overall a good flight.
Rhodes to Dublin. On way back we stood in line for 2 hours to check in. Then again for hour for security check. Then probably another hour for passport control before boarding. We were three hours early but flight ended up an hour late. Elderly and disabled stood for 3 hours.
One of the worst check in experience ever. In theory you can get the boarding pass online but I tried on this flight and in a couple of other flights to get it with the app and from the website. Always failed. Call the number and the operator is very nice and tries hard to appease you telling you they will look into it and try later but it simply does not work. So to get the boarding pass you need to go to the airport checkin where inevitably you find a single very long line rolling out to the outside of the airport entrance of the departure hall. The line is not even sorted by destinations or by departure times. Many Tui staff in uniform hanging around to assist you but no real help is provided. Despite operating in an Italian airport the staff does not speak Italian but only English. Appalling service. I will certainly try to avoid this company in the future.
We flew with Singapore to New York for the first time and were very pleased. Everything was professional and comfortable. The staff helped us with everything. Nothing to complain about.
Worst customer service experience Ive ever had with an airline in 33 years. We were due to fly from JFK to Delhi connecting through Jeddah on December 20th. Saudi proactively cancelled our flights from Jeddah to Delhi with no heads up. Pandemic and preemptive travel closures sure. We had to call the customer service department multiple times just to cancel our full itinerary. They kept giving us the run around telling us to contact their WhatsApp support line more on this or to email them. Finally after no success on those fronts they were able to cancel the flights on our 5th or 6th phone attempt. They claim the customer service phone department where you can talk to humans is completely disconnected from refunds processing and you can only do the latter via WhatsApp or email. The WhatsApp support is the laziest most lackadaisical responsiveness Ive ever seen. They claim 247 support but regularly take 610 hours to respond to a chat and start a conversation. When they do reply usually with 1 word or 1 line if you dont reply within 10 minutes they close the chat out and you have to start the conversation all over again with another agent. I repeated this cycle for 4 days on repeat just to be able to submit a simple refund request for a flight they cancelled. Phone support was unwilling to process a refund. Once I did eventually get through a submit a refund claim via WhatsApp the phone agent was unable and unwilling to give me any indication of refund status. So unclear now whether Ive even been refunded for a flight that they cancelled. Do not fly Saudi Arabian Airlines. Read other reviews showing the kinds of thirdrate customer service operations they run.
Outbound flight with British Airways from Gatwick to Orlando was good chose seats at the back of the aircraft and ended up with 9 seats 3 rows between five of us so we could stretch out and relax. Food was surprisingly good served chicken curry with basmati rice for lunch and a chicken caesar salad sandwich for afternoon tea. Plenty of choice of drinks and snacks available throughout the flight in the rear galley. Inbound flight was less good. Took the cabin crew over three hours to do the drinks and dinner service leaving less than 3 hours to get some sleep prior to breakfast being served. My sons childrens meal took nearly two hours to arrive by which time he was starving. Dinner was chicken with dumplings which tasted a lot better than it looked. Breakfast was very poor a small croissant with jam and a granola bar. The crew seemed stressed and disorganised for the entire flight. The AVOD system is starting to look dated compared with other carriers there are a limited number of programmes to watch and the audio selection is very small. BA need to look at upgrading this in line with some of the Asian carriers who are miles ahead in this respect. Seats were comfortable and legroom good. Overall I would fly BA again but they could certainly improve some aspects of their service.
Johannesburg to Lisbon via Luanda it was my first time flying with TAAG but unfortunately it will be the last. I checked in online and booked 3 seats together when I got to the airport I was informed my seats had to be changed. I got on board to my new seats and found the 2 of the seats were missing the entertainment screens. Cables were loose and hanging from the space where the TV screens are supposed to be. I told the air hostess and she informed she would move us once we were in the air. Once we were in the air the air hostess refused to talk to me and refused to move us. I complained and said if there is no room on economy they must move me elsewhere again I was ignored and eventually one air hostess shouted at me that I will not be moving. I was informed the entertainment screens were not working before our flight by the staff so they sold us seats without telling us the problems. One air hostess then apologized and said I must write in the complaints book when I asked for it they refused to give me a pen or any of their names. Finally the whole economy section had problems with the aircon and everyone was complaining about the heat and discomfort.
Incredible experience from start to finish. Feel like I was the only one on the plane. I heard anecdotally how good this was to be and I can honestly say my expectations were exceeded. I have found my airline. I feel comfortable now that all my future airline needs are in good hands. Looking for to the return trip in late September. See you soon.
I made the unfortunate mistake of booking with Sunwing in mid December for a trip to Mexico over the holidays. Due to pandemic related concerns I used their Worry Free Cancellation to cancel the trip on December 17. I was provided with a voucher reference number and was told it would take a month to be issued. I contacted Sunwing at the beginning of February to rebook and was told my voucher had not been processed and a timeline for issuing it could not be provided. Disappointing to say the least. Questionable business practices based on the many reviews with the exact same experience. A company to be avoided at all costs.
Kuala Lumpur to Pangkor Island return. This is the most pleasant way of flying for those who love airplanes
Flew Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong to Auckland. Not exactly what I expected from a 5 Star airline. There was enough space from the seat in front but the seat was very narrow Meals were acceptable considering the class flown. Flight attendants were almost nonexistant during the flight very poor service in premium economy They appeared to be more concerned with keeping the economy passengers happy
I have been flying Edelweiss Air twice since last year from Zurich airport and I have never had any problems of any kind. The staff were friendly and efficient the flights were on time and the aircraft A320 were clean and modern. Two weeks ago I flew ZRHJMK Mykonos in Comfort Class. You just have to pay an additional fee of CHF 100. one way and you can sit at rows 1 to 3 the service is better and you dont have to pay for alcoholic beverages. To my opinion Edelweiss Air is an excellent airline considering the fact that it is a charter airline.
Flew Perth to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Check in was quick and smooth. The boarding was orderly and the crew greeted the passengers with a smile. Found a pillow and blanket on my seat. The seat and leg room was average. No footrests but liked the flexible adjustable headrests. Flight left only a few minutes late from the scheduled take off. Shortly after take off the crew came out with hot towels snacks drinks and food menu. There were enough alcoholic drinks to choose from. I got myself a Tiger beer but I had to ask for second beer would have preferred if the crew had offered. Food was fresh and tasted great didnt taste like airline food at all. There was salmon with coleslaw crackers and cheese bread roll and butter along with 2 choices of main course. My Asian beef curry was delicious. For dessert we had fresh fruit salad and gelato. The best meal I have had on a flight and this was all in economy class. The let down was the IFE. The screens were small and had poor resolution no touchscreen either. The headphone jack was fiddly I was using my personal headphones but occasionally I would lose sound in either left or right channel. I watched Dunkirk 2017 which was good. On arrival the luggage arrived quickly and without any damage. Overall a good flight but was disappointed with IFE. The ticket was also expensive compared with other airlines.
Estonian Air 145 TallinnCopenhagen June 12 2014. Flew Tallinn Copenhagen in flex class premium economy which means free meal and bar service 23 kgs of luggage and flexibility to change tickets. The food consisted of smoked salmon on a slice of bread a small but fresh salad and an appetizing Sacher cake. Not too much but enough for the 1hr 20 minute flight. Swift boarding and disembarkation aircraft clean and fresh newspapers available friendly staff clear safety announcements over good audio system and interesting inflight magazine to while the time away. Estonian Air is a small and pleasant regional airline.
Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur. This was a code share from Malaysian Airlines and there was some eticket number missing in one of the the 3 passenger details. The lady and her superior at check in was quite inefficient at solving the problem we had with our ticket. We were told to call Malaysia Airlines how can JAL treat us like that. I asked the staff at check in if she could speak to my travel agent in India but she said only if the travel agent speaks in Japanese.
I flew economy from JFKEZE through Lima and MVD to JFK through Santiago. The longhaul segments were on clean comfortable 767s with personal entertainment in the seat back. The South America legs were on A319A320 without personal entertainment but folddown screens showing local TV and or an American film. Longhaul flights served dinner and breakfast which were decent enough and came with complementary wine. The flight crews were friendly and responsive. All four flights were on time smooth and relatively comfortable. Return flight from Santiago to NYC was relatively empty so passengers could lay down across three seats in the middle row. LAN will be my first choice for future South America travel.
First time using Ethiopian Airlines check in at Heathrow T2 was pretty quick although the checkin agent failed to include my frequent flier status on the boarding pass which presented issues when trying to use the fast track lounges luckily I had a copy on my mobile. Used the SilverKris lounge which is good boarding a bit disorganised but once onboard my seat 11A was comfortable enough. Flight departed on time for the 7 hour flight to Addis Ababa service food Dinner Breakfast and crew where okay. The PTV was also alright the seat not too bad arriving Addis the transfer was straight forward and the airport itself wasnt too bad. I used the Cloud Nine Gold lounge which is a bit better than the general terminal boarding the 2nd flight was again a bit of a mess. Another A350 and once again seat 11A however the seat had a fault so not too comfortable crew where a bit vacant on this flight. The food a sandwich and lunch was again okay perhaps better than the first flight. Arrived CPT more or less on time after a flight of around 6 hours bags delivered quickly so I suppose all in all Ethiopian got me from A to B finally C without too much stress. I guess the one improvement would be the ground operation its pretty poor and rude at some points. I wouldnt use Ethiopian again but they are okay for what they charge.
Delta is horrible Our flight was fully boarded and on the runway and we were waiting for 2 hours as they were understaffed and waiting for bad weather to clear. We finally went back to a gate where our luggage was no where to be seen and they offered no refunds or reimbursements and said we were stuck in New York for 4 days with no more flights until Saturday. Horrible staff who were mean and couldnt answer a single question. Lost a lot of money to them and they handled the situation horribly. Awful experience and now we are stuck in New York because not only are planes fully booked but all car services as well.
Tel Aviv to Tallinn via Riga. My cabin luggage was 400g overweight and they made me pay 60 while saying that if you dont you wont get to the flight. At the same time they knew that flight was being delayed I had friends who could deliver those overweight things to me next week for free
We arrived 3 and half hours before our flight the queues to BA was terrible. The airport security lines were not managed well. The gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate with asthma. It was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced. All the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least 4 hours before to have an enjoyable experience. Amsterdam is the worst airport I have experienced.
We travelled Club Europe from Gatwick to Paphos as we were going out to get married. The extra luggage was handy due to the dress and all the extras that we needed to take but we could have paid for the extra space at much less a cost. As it was our wedding we decided to treat ourselves and go the full hog so spent nearly 1000 extra on Club Europe seats expecting to get a really good experience. Check in was quick and easy but there was no queue at the normal check in either so we didnt really benefit from that. The lounge was nothing particularly impressive although we didnt get there with much time to spare so that was more our fault. We were let on the plane first through the front of the plane the problem was that the rest of the passengers also came through the same door and through the Club Europe section so to be able to put our bags up into the compartment I had to stand by my seat until the entire plane had boarded. The seating then was just a row of 3 seats with the middle seat blocked off so although there was extra room it wasnt what Id have expected. Our bags were marked as priority with the tags but came out with the rest of the luggage. I dont know if we went in expecting more than we should have but for the extra money we paid I think we were entitled to have higher expectations. Not an ideal way to start our wedding experience. Wed never travel Club Europe again it was a complete waste of money so hopefully others will read this and save the money to spend on the rest of the holiday
No problems with our flight to Florence. Friendly checkin flight left on time and arrived 10 mins early. Seats more comfortable than expected and light refreshments served suitable for a 2 hr flight. We were a bit worried having read so many bad reviews and hope our return flight is as good as the outgoing one.
Maputo to Denpasar via Doha was very disappointing. Qatar Airways was very average and on occasions below average on these flights. Chairs were not great especially the entertainment console under the chair in front of you. The internet was the worst Ive experienced and the most expensive. Food was okay nothing exceptional. Unfortunately no Qatar any more for me and its confirmed that the 787 is not my plane. The A350 is so much quieter and more comfortable
Berlin to Hanoi via Doha. The cabin crew served me unprofessional unfriendly without eye contact they can speak English well. I had to transfer in Doha for 20 Hours and expected I would have accommodation offer for 20 hours. I dont get the offer and have to stay in the airport for 20 hours. The staff just gave me the information she didnt tell me what kind of alternatives I have like staying in a quiet room or lounge or airport hotel until i asked her.
Travelled Kigali via Nairobi to Johannesburg and back within 2 days midMarch 2020. Aircraft were E190 on short leg and Boeing 7878 on long legs. All flights on time. No luggage issues. Checked in online. Had to wait 1 hour in airport as they only open check in 2 hours before departure. Upgraded 1st leg KGLNBO by a modest but successful online bid. Granted lounge access by courtesy in Nairobi as my Gold Card was just earned during the same trip but of course not processed in their system. In Kigali they use Pearl lounge which is deteriorating since Rwandair opened a new lounge opposite. Kenya Airways Pride Lounge in Nairobi is wonderful. Food served onboard was substandard and particular breakfasts were a disgrace. However drink supplies were fine. I like the Happy Hours approach they use on regional routes like to Dubai and JNB where you order a drink or wine and they often double up the order without asking. I have only received this double up service before on Gulf Air and the now deceased Jet Airways. That is generous positive approach and make one feel very appreciated and cared for in economy class where benefits otherwise are sparse. FAs are very good though advised an FA to avoid chewing gum as it is cause feeling of disrespect to some passengers. Champagne on business class is good and offered also before departure. No IFE on short legs but on long legs plenty of films to watch. No WiFi onboard. I was given 3 seats on all flights were not full thanks to corona virus fear and close downs.
SINSZB on ATR twinprop. I got autoselected for row 11 but decided I wanted a quieter seat and so went to 1D. Flight left late. Im not sure but perhaps it was because of a heavy thunder storm and arrived late by 10 mins. Boarding was fast and there was a choice of muffin or peanuts guava or mango juice. Flight was reasonably smooth. Luggage came out quickly enough although being 1D means being last at the immigration queue. My hotel was 20 mins away 45 mins from KLIA so this was a good fight for me.
Icelandair had leased an additional aircraft to operate our flight. Flight attendants were so rude. They yelled at customers and tossed food and drinks around as If they hated their job. Worst flight and rudest service ever. Icelandair didnt operate this hellish flight themselves but they are responsible for what company they lease aircraft from. Definitely not worth the tickets we paid for. The other flight operated by Icelandair themselves went as it should.
Flew Qatar Airways from Doha to Kiev. 5 hour flight in the morning. Took off on time landed 40 min prior to schedule. Only had 1 meals. Seats were comfortable for legs Im tall guy. Screens are small but this aircraft has WiFi connection. Service as always exceptional Blanket and pillows provided but other things no since its not a long haul flight.
We use Sunwing for all inclusive in Cancun of 7 days. We lost 1 day because of Sunwing. First flight was a 8h30 in the morning the send us one email few hours before that the flight is delayed at 21h for a mechanic problem. We were already at the airport. We had to fight only to get taxi voucher. Came back did all the check in and security. At 20h30 they put on the screen of the airport that the flight was delayed to 6h in the morning the next day. Again we had the argue just to know why. The Pilot didnt show up. At least they gave room to everybody. We had ours at midnight only for a nap and a shower. By the law they have to give us 5001000 of compensation because its there fault. They said it was for safety and dont give any compensation. Avoid this company at all cost.
We flew from Jacksonville to Baltimore. Flight was delayed and I had to make another flight. We stayed at airport over nine hours. Now we are trying to fly back home to Jacksonville and this flight is delayed. Never again will fly such an incompetent airline. So trying to cancel trip in Sept ticket is non refundable
Kiev to Tallinn via Riga. I am very disappointed by the airline. I had layover 40 minutes in Riga where I have to pass passport and security control. The plane from Kiev landed 20 minutes later. I was expecting the airline worker to met us near the gate but there was nobody. On the passport control there was a long queue. On the security check there was an even bigger queue. However only one line worked. Moreover all people in the queue also were late so I was not able to fast forward. We have managed to arrive at the gate 3 minutes prior the departure time and board the plane. The plane was Boeing 737300 which is an old garbage. The brakes produced terrible noise. The interior was old. The tickets are expensive while the service is worse then lowcost airlines.
My mom came out to visit us. When going home her flight was cancelled after she sat on the plane for an entire day. Instead of being helpful and trying help her get home they left her high and dry. She was forced to rebook without any help and had to buy a much more expensive ticket to get home. They reimbursed her for the original ticket only. She got home 24 hours later than she was supposed and paid them for the privilege.
As per new rules they follow passengers who traveling on Ethiopian Airlines must hold return ticket only with Ethiopian airlines to get boarding pass. Actually my return ticket was with Qatar Airways. If they follow the rules should inform very earlier to passengers those who travel in Ethiopian Airlines. Ground staff at Chennai who are responsible to explain the reason why they denied to issue boarding pass must be polite with customers.
Im used to fly with Air France as it is my home airline. But over the past years the level of service has critically decreased. I was very disappointed by the food served during my Singapore to Paris flight last night worst one Ive ever had for both meals and by the discomfort of the seats which appeared to be relatively new though. In comparison the Phuket to Singapore 2hours journey was pleasant with decent food and very comfortable seats operated by Silkair. I was also very confused by the inflight safety video which is I assume meant to be funny and to show typical French cliches fashion style but it was barely understandable for my partner a nonFrench speaker because of the strong accent of the presenter. Its not the first time I see it but this time I realized how bad it was as some people around me simply didnt understand what the hostess was saying. I used to have the Gold status but despite the 30 flights I took with them in 2016 I lost it. I understand they have financial issues but treating their loyal customer like this by lowering the level of service so much wont make them earn more money. On national flights Ive been positively surprised by the service provided by lowcost companies lately. Air France has gone so far that I will pay less and flight with these companies for short journeys instead of flying with them and not getting any value for money.
Returning home from Boston to Ogdensburg severe fog did not permit takeoff of CapeAirs small plane. Several people absolutely had to get home that night. Cape Air went above and beyond. They rebooked all of us on an outbound flight from Logan to Albany then hired a driver in an ubercomfy shuttle van to drive everyone the rest of the way to Ogdensburg. Long journey and not quite what any of us was anticipating that day but cannot say enough about the service and kindness of the Cape Air staff.
I had the best customer service experience I dealt with Christine in the Seattle branch and she was expremely helpful very professional cheerful and informative. Thank you Christine for having such wonderful customer service skills and cheerful disposition Totally made my day and makes me feel comfortable having my children fly without me for the first time. You are a wonderful representative for the airline theyre lucky to have you
Terrible Business Lounge in Sao Paulo. No wifi awful cold food not good sandwiches and uncomfortable seats harsh lighting. Once youre on the flight Inattentive staff uncomfortable seats not good food and youre lucky if you get a glass of wine in the first 2 hours. I wont be flying with them again. Make BA look like saints.
Dubai to Tabuk. Im waiting for my boarding and I was just shouted at for a simple misunderstanding. They asked me to come 4 hours in advance simply to cover for their failure to manage the time of the flights.
Johannesburg to Seychelles. First time travelling with Air Seychelles and I was very impressed. Ground staff was very helpful. Food was excellent cabin staff was friendly. The flight was comfortable and there was a variety of entertainment on board. Great airline would definitely recommend.
Honestly American Airlines has to do much better. These carriers they use for smaller cities are tiny and full to capacity. Theres barely any room to move. Why in the world when I am booking American Airlines am I being assigned this carrier I think this information should be better disclosed to passengers when they are purchasing their flights. The plane smelt like pee and we were delayed by over 15 minutes without any explanation. Its like an expensive bus ride to upstate NY without any damn amenities. So long as they continue to utilize this carrier for the the airport I live near to I wont be booking any flights with with them.
What a terrible experience. Truly an awful airline. Every possible delay that could happen happened. Here is the sequence of events 1 Flight got delayed by an hour fine whatever this happens 2 Initial plane has mechanical issues forcing us to have to be bused 10 minutes away to another aircraft fine I understand sometimes its just a bad day 3 We have to stand on the bus for 30 minutes in the Cali heat because the plane we were switched to was actively being worked on when the bus we were in arrived this is where I start getting peeved 4 We get on the plane and are notified one of the bathrooms is out of order 5 Fine flight a little bumpy whatever. 6 We land in Salt Lake I think the ordeal is over heres where it got so much worse. 7 They inform us they do not have a gate for us to approach to get off the plane and that we are in limbo. They say it will be another 2040 minutes until we can get off the plane Im annoyed at this point but recognize its almost over Ill be home soon 8 This process repeats multiple times. We are told every 2040 minutes that it will be another 2040 minutes and this goes on for approximately 2 hours. During this time as a consultation they offer us an 8oz middle school milk carton of water 9 Finally we get a gate we pull up everyone starts standing up getting their bags out of overhead and we all start to notice its taking a while to open the door about 15 minutes at this point and then the announcement comes on that there is an issue of a large gap between the plane and the hallway thing that connects to the plane and at this point the plane is turned off meaning the AC is turned off and were forced to sit there for another 25 minutes before finally getting off the plane. I would absolutely never ever fly with this airline again. I would choose any option besides this. Spirit Frontier man Id rather drives just an absolute flightmare.
After posting my last message on this site. Oman Air have communicated with me again to ask me for the same information I have sent before. They tell me once again they will answer within 15 days its just playing for time this is six times now. We had to cancel the flight due to COVID restrictions we waited the year in accordance with the airlines regulations. Oman Air said they would pay it back in line with their regulations.
Athens to Heathrow. I cannot believe that British Airways want to embarrass flight staff so much as they try to cope with all the comments regarding the food served which we were never warned about. We paid over 700 for our flight two of us. It is so sad for loyal customers if we wanted to go on Easyjet or Ryanair we would but to receive the same treatment is a great shame.
12th February 2024 From check in to get onboard remarkable experience. Since steping at Hamad International airport every one was so welcoming. Check in agent was very professional and helpful. Al mourjan lounge was realy good. Great tasting food. On board all cabin crew was kind professional welcoming. Seat very good leg space and incredible service and a very clean plane. Inflight entertainment was great too. The staff was very polite. Arriving at London Qatar staff gave me Fast track card that helps me to pass imigration quick. Thank you Qatar Airways.
Krabi to Chiang Mai via Bangkok. Worst experience ever. The flight from krabi to Bangkok was delayed more than four hours. As a consequence we missed our connection from Bangkok to Chiang mai. In Krabi they informed us wed take a flight to Chiang mai the next day at 1am. However when we arrived in Bangkok they said wed have to fly to Chiang Rai and take a 5 hour bus to Chiang mai. We made a lot of complaints and we received no reply.
I was flying with SmartWings to Prague on June 19. My flight has been almost 5 hrs delayed and rather than midnight we landed in Prague at almost 5am. Things like that can happen and this is why there is a regulation which protects the passengers and stipulate compensation in case of significant delay. I have requested to get compensated but get no reaction from the airline. Therefore I have forwarded my claim in registered letter on Sep 9th. Again a radio silence. In January I have made my claim through the web page of the company. No reaction It is crystal clear that SmartWings is simply ignoring not only the civilized business practices and displaying terrible customer attitude but they also choose to disrespect the respective laws and regulation. And taking the conclusion never ever use SmartWings.
A very pleasant surprise for my first time on Nouvelair flying from Monastir to Paris CDG. Very friendly staff and excellent service on the ground and in the air. Reasonably priced food and drink on board. Flight was generally on time. Great and easy experience flying out of Monastir airport. Overall so much better than the national Tunisian carrier.
Amsterdam to Prague. The departure was delayed by just under 2 hours with no information sent in advance one found out only at the airport. Checkin facilities lacked a simple swift baggage drop which with only 2 or 3 desks being open contributed to a longer than expected queue. As we were boarding we noticed our seat allocation from checkin desk boarding cards differed than the one from our online checkin boarding passes with seats now separated by multiple rows this was not communicated to us. The ground staff couldnt explain why there was a seat change and showed little care about swapping us back together. On the plane it was very hot and FA informed they cannot switch on the AC until engines are started. Throughout the flight the temperature continued to be unpleasantly high. At the arrival the crew provided the least specific reason for the delay and rushed to say it was not their fault. Deplaning was through a bridge but in the middle passengers were asked to climb down stairs and get on the bus with no help provided for the elderly. Flying EZY on this route is a better choice unless the fares are higher than the Czech Airlines prices.
Ive always favoured British Airways and will always try and choose to fly with them which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel. I have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early checkin and onflight catering for economy. However BA have stripped both the above perks. I now struggle to see the value and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of Easyjet yet you pay almost double. Then today I flew back from Denmark with SAS and it was amazing and made BA look cheap. Not only do you get a good meal on board you get free drink can charge your electronics and get wifi for only 2.9 Euros. Outstanding.
I flew with Air France from London to Bangkok via Paris Charles de Gaulle I enjoyed both flights. Boarding was fast flight attendants were attentive and friendly good inflight entertainment and the food was quite nice compared to other airlines. I do travel very often and Air France is one of the best airline in Europe. Looking forward to fly with them again soon.
Turkish Airlines delay in Beirut had us sitting on the tarmac there for 45 minutes prior to takeoff effectively ensuring wed miss our Sofia connection in Istanbul. Fast food voucher and rescheduled for a flight 5 hours later which was delayed another 2 hours. In Istanbul they changed gates on the airport monitors twice having us running firm one end of the airport to the other A gates to F gates and back again. If you consider how huge Istanbul airport is youll feel our pain. Boarding is disorganized. They should forget their cursory attempt at food service and focus on getting people places on time They turned what should have been a 45 hour transit time into a 15 hour ordeal. Ill only fly them in the future under duress.
Flights from LJU to ZRH and back all on time. In Economy class was served just coffee tea an water but its fine for one and a half hour flight. Very friendly and helpful cabin crew members. Very clean and comfortable cabin on CRJ900 aircraft.
First off Ill start by saying Spirit Airlines is the first airline to ever give me problems they are understaffed so the line was out of the door and at a stand still for at least an hour then they board my checked luggage on the plane but doesnt let me board when I missed boarding due to their error with the staff not moving fast enough. Almost 40 people in the Las Vegas airport missed their flights this morning and its crazy because they held us liable even though they have 23 people at the check in stations to service over 75100 people that were in line. I will never FLY fly Spirit again.
Very comfortable flight. The flight departed in the evening and a full meal bread cheese 2 warm dish options desert water with complimentary wine of good quality was provided. Arrived early morning in Paris before arrival breakfast was served. Also additional beverages were distributed twice during the flight after the meals. Kind and helpful staff reasonable legroom and the option to select a seat for a small fee. Inflight entertainment was OK but very French oriented just like the messages from captain and crew delivered in accented and rapid English The airport at Point A Pitre only uses French for the announcements. Luggage delivery at Orly took quite a long time but unclear whether the airline is to blame. Overall a very comfortable economy class experience. If you dont understand French though you might struggle a bit to understand the announcements etc.
Ho Chi Minh to San Francisco via Hong Kong. The food on the flight was bland and cold. Im on a family vacation since January 28 but my returning flight leaves on March 4 and I wish to leave earlier. To change it to February 23 it would cost me over 200. I wish the airline had some sympathy that people want to leave early because of a virus. Ive called my booking agent the airline customer service line and did everything I could to change my flight departure date but all was answered with a the service change will be 200. I wish the airline overall would change such policy.
Prague to London. This is the first time I have flown with British Airways. The flight departed earlier than intended and got to Heathrow about 5 minutes early. However at Heathrow there was a plane in the way as we had arrived early. A negative was at the checkin partly the websites fault as we had done the online check in. We selected the amount of bags we each had. It said we would have to pay extra and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay 65 for each bag. Apart from those negatives and the delay I would definitely fly this airline again.
Qantas has shockingly declined. The meals were tiny and pathetic. Staff were ok but flight to Melbourne was over an hour late. Qantas has declined. I used to love them but now I wont choose them again. The meals were honestly a joke
I was on a particularly turbulent red eye flight from Seattle to Fort Lauderdale last tuesday night and I have extreme flight anxiety. I had a panic attack in the bathroom and Victoria one of the first class flight attendants came and held my hand and talked me through the experience then she sat me in the back row near the flight attendants. The row I was put on was with another flight attendants I wish I knew her name boyfriend and he talked to me for three hours while she and other attendants came by to periodically check up on me. They gave me a fuzzy heat pad and water and so much compassion. I cant even begin to express the amount of gratitude I felt towards these people. I normally fly with my husband or family but circumstances had me take the flight on my own and I really wanted to meet my new born niece. I highly recommend this airline.. Ive been on plenty of flights with attendants that get by doing the bare minimum.. this was not one of them. I would like to thank them from the bottom of my soul for helping me get through that night and for helping me maintain my faith in humanity.
They lost our stroller on a delayed connection flight which can happen but they just dont care. They close reclamations without resolution there is no customer care at all and you need to legally fight them for anything.
I recently endured a highly inconvenient 24hour flight delay with Air France AF 0206 from Paris to Mumbai on January 18th. The lack of communication about the technical issue was frustrating. After deboarding the confusion continued with no guidance on hotel arrangements leading us to a distant hotel. The following morning the gate was changed without notice. I am disappointed with the overall lack of communication.
Food wise it was bleah to meh but palatable. The FA were quite fast to attend to general request. The IFE screen was small and the selection of movies was meagre but with the small screen with poor resolution my handphone Samsung Note 3 provided better entertainment if I wanted to use it. I preordered an item for Duty Free purchase for my wife on the prior flight and supposed to collect it on this flight. However they said there was a mistake made by the FA on the prior flight who helped make our preorder. The response that I got was please call us when you reach your destination and we will sort it out. What Call I told them they should try to rectify it on their end and when we disembark. Why arent the FA trained properly It could have been better managed
We have just flown economy class London to Los Angeles on the A380. Outbound the meal was chicken which I do not eat so I was offered an almost inedible pasta dish. No more food was offered until 2 hours before landing chicken sandwiches I asked for a replacement cheese and chutney was offered. I was actually hungry by this time. Return journey was chicken curry replaced by vegetarian lasagne. Breakfast was awful a cardboard box containing a croissant jam cereal bar and a packet of dried cranberries. The service between meals was non existent. By far the worst airline food I have ever eaten. Sorry no British Airways for us.
Dubai to London. I have been flying Emirates for 34 years since they started. Recently did a return trip to London for 3 days in business. They sent an S class Mercedes to pick me at home in Dubai I hung out in the C terminal lounge where I smoked a cigar both flights there and back in A380s and on the Gatwick return it was 2 months old and very pleasant. Crew were attentive friendly food and drinks excellent ICE was outstanding. In fact along with another S class Mercedes in London this is the only way to fly to London. I consistently rank them as one of the worlds best airlines.
Extremely chaotic check in at MLA with no British Airways staff checking who is queuing where resulting in premium lane being filled with non C class FF members. Security even more busy with Ryanair and Easyjet passengers going through priority fast track. Flight ok with warm food chicken in mushroom veloute or beef with crushed potatoes also with mushroom and enough champagne to make one feel sleepy. Saying that if you have a mushroom allergy beware as there is no option to preorder your meal online or over the phone for that specific allergy BA should do something about this. Annoying passengers as per usual when using LGW for me thats a holiday airport with people who dont fly often yet they claim to be the Alfa and omega of flying to the point that we were told off by people behind us for reclining our seats and I quote obviously you dont fly much us being silver with BA and gold with LH.... Landed ahead of schedule but ended up waiting for bags until all were offloaded despite having a priority tag on them. Excellent and friendly cabin crew.
HANHKG KA 294 in Business. The departure was 30 mins delayed. The pick up in Hong Kong was excellent they brought me to the gate for the next flight to Germany. They informed me that my window seat was out of order 10 A and put me to the end of the cabin 17C. After landing I found out that they just want to optimize the seat and just stuck us in another seat. Food was good service was poor I ordered some drinks and they just ignored it. There was no movie in the entertainment channel only TV and some documents.
Took OZ754 from Singapore to Seoul and was assigned a flight without any personal inflight entertainment I am very surprised at this. Service was soso. Food portion and taste was also ok. The only good thing is that the leg room is wider. I will not consider taking Asiana again for my next Korea trip.
I took a midnight flight with Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong to London Heathrow which was very full. I was able to change my seat after boarding as the USB plug on my initial seat was not working. The food was pretty good. I was impressed they served desserts twice during dinner and snack time. IFE was with a very wide range of movies which were very new. Seats on 777 were quite fair but I was really impressed with the very sensitive IFE screen.
I was unable to check in for some reason and I was given a seat in the middle. I tried to change it but after checkin at Oslo for the SAS flight checkin kiosk couldnt change it so I called Aegean. After 3 calls to the customer service line I was instructed it is fixed and I should checkin on the app paying for my seat change. At boarding in Stockholm I was faced to pay my seat change.
New York to Mumbai via Dubai. Comfortable clean and modern aircraft. In flight entertainment excellent. Food was decent and warm. Customer care is poor. The flight crew are running around doing whatever they feel. Most of the time they are sitting in the middle talking to each other. I have been flying internationally for last 15 years and this was the first time a crew member got upset when I made a request for water. In between meals no beverage provided. Even when meal service was being done one of the stewardess rushed past everyone so that no one could order. This airline is not worth your money. Please spend a few more bucks and go to Qatar Airways where you will be respected as a human being or go cheap on Etihad as they are worth what you pay. Emirates no longer cares about its customers. I regret spending my money and keeping my expectations high with Emirates. Never will I fly them again.
This airline has horrible customer service. They made me pay for a carry on with a backpack that was not even questioned on the way down to Fort Myers. Do not fly this airline. They do not care about their customers and charge unnecessary fees. Not worth saving money on a ticket...because you dont. Terrible experience.
GVALGWGVA A319 out and A320 in. On time in both directions staff were professional and polite. Sandwich out and a choice of snacks crisps biscuits or chocolate raisins in as well as complementary drinks including alcohol. Smooth through Geneva airport in and out stuck in a 40minute passport queue at LGW on the way in not BAs fault of course followed by a long walk around renovation work for the airport shuttle to the train station. This was a rare occasion where BA was cheaper than all of the competition on the route. On balance I just dont think the BA experience is much better than the lowcost competition unless you fly to Heathrow where Terminal 5 is much nicer than Gatwick. Although the food and drink is free the choice is quite limited e.g. no British beer no option to buy something substantial if youre hungry and the snack was a bit stingy on the way back. I thought we might get newspapers but we didnt. On balance it was perfectly fine but I wouldnt pay the extra for BA Id actually rather have the choice friendliness and flexibility you get with easyJet.
The airline introduced a totally absurd rule regarding all passengers having to seal their luggage in plastic wrap. What is absolutely lovely about this is that they dont let you check in your luggage unless its wrapped in some airports they allow it however so they even arent good about following their own rule. Now imagine being in an airport with a single wrapping center where you can only pay cash and where there is no ATM. A full flight of people having to spend a lot of time wrapping and searching all of their pockets hoping they have enough cash left. A very beautiful experience related with a totally understandable rule. The company does not offer any explanation for this request as far as I know they are the only ones requesting this and I can only assume they are playing a game in collaboration with some wrapping companies in order to find another way to steal money from tourists. Very elegant Blue Air I am deeply disappointed and dissatisfied.
AirAsia India from Bengaluru to Delhi. The original time of departure was 00.05 hours however there was a delay of 15 minutes which was communicated in advance. The boarding pass print and check in of the baggage was performed at the designated points. Boarding was slightly delayed and as a result of which we ended up being delayed by over 20 minutes. The seats inside the Airbus were comfortable enough although it could be uncomfortable for longer flights. Seat pitch was comfortable at 30 inches and for someone who is 510 it was okay. The crew were very proactive and good. I observed that the crew even provided infant seat belts and snack items. We landed at Delhi around 2025 minutes behind schedule and the baggage collecting took some time on the coveyor belt. Overall Id say that if you get this flight for a good price and for a reasonable distance it is okay.
Amsterdam to Istanbul. On August 30th i had a problem with checking in on my flight to Istanbul. They told me my ticket was invalid because I accidentally used my initials instead of my full first name while booking my tickets. All the other information was correct but they still made me buy a new ticket. The employee behind the service desk told me that i could get a refund if I contacted the head office. I have called and emailed them but they will not reply. To make matters worse as a reply to my feedback form that they suggested i fill in and send they just said case resolved without talking to me. I have spend an extra 500 euros and the least I expect from Turkish Airlines is a reply to my questioncomplaint. They dont seem to care about their customers at all and I am very disappointed.
They allow 60 minutes for a connecting flight in the Istanbul Airport which the means the baggage can be lost or delayed as in my case the baggage tracing is miserable no one answers the phone. There was a flight the same day a few hours later but I have still not received my luggage 24 hours after arrival. The airline is a disgrace.
An almost 2hr delay with super clear skies because of their own reasons delayed arrival of airplane and then waiting 50 min in the plain to get a lane to fly.
Melbourne to Hong Kong via Bandar seri Begawan. I have been treated excellently even I can only afford to pay for economy class for myself and my daughter. This is such an amazing treat that I have ever been to any airlines. I wanted to say thank you to Royal Brunei Airlines to the flight attendants. The food and drinks provided are very generous and great quality.
The worst airline anybody can come across. Their website so difficult to navigate the App invariably does not work or the boarding card is so faint and cannot be read at the airport the staff rude and unhelpful. When you need to contact Customer Services they direct to a overseas number I think Romania and you are charged 1.95 per minute. The Staff English is poor and you can hardly understand them. In addition there is a delay in their flights with no explanation or even an apology. It appears to be a budget airline but when you add the extra charges for a 20kg bag to and from your destination it become more expensive than other airlines. Attempted to buy tickets for a trip to Cyprus on 14 May 2023 and including the fare two bags pf 20kg and seats it came to 965 return. I finally booked through British Airways all inclusive for 565. Wizz Air never again. I advise people to keep away from Wizz Air if they can.
Really bad services and no information for our 4h30mn delay. We had a flight from Bruxelles to Heraklion. Our flight was supposed to be at 6.30 we arrive at the airport without seeing the flight on the board. We had no email no information until we saw the number of our flight at 10am on the board. We waited 3h30 then had the number of the gate 20mns before the supposed 10am departure. No information from the crew until we seated in the aircraft and 40 more minutes of delay once on the plane. For sure we will not take this company again. We flight quite often and its the worst company we experimented.
ZRHFNC C class. Outstanding service Predeparture drinks champagne juice water amenity kit as usual on longhaul flights headphones hot towels full breakfast with good selection of cold hot plate and breadcroissants and lots of drinks available. Hot snack service 1h00 before arrival. Crew very friendly attentive and professional. On time flight. One of the best flights I ever did
Only flew internal flights 3 legs on AN24. Drinks beer or cider provided on the 2 longer legs. No IFE. FAs spoke reasonable English and were friendly. No safety demonstration and the overhead bins were just overhead shelves. I like the way you can push the empty seats all the way forward so they lie flat in a halfempty plane its a good option for more leg room There is no choice flying domestic in DPRK but Air Koryo provided good entertainment.
Have been a Qantas Frequent Flyer since 1997 but also flown with them well before then both domestically and internationally. Due to their high prices my employer has been booking my flights with Virgin and I found them second to none in both hospitality and service. After all these years with Qantas I have made the move to Virgin as the Qantas service hospitality and condition of terminals and lounges is nothing less than the dark ages.
BVELCY. Superb service into London City. Check in at Brive Airport was super quick and found myself in London in no time. The fare was reasonable and dont forget to include the saving of flying into London City and taking the DLRtube instead of an expensive airport express train. Allocated seating luggage and drinkssnacks on board make the flight so much more pleasant than flying with a budget airline.
We boarded a flight from Nassau Bahamas to Tampa FL which was due to arrive at our destination at 445pm. Due to weather the captain informed us they didnt load enough fuel to circle Tampa and wait for the weather to clear. We eventually arrived at 9pm but our baggage did not. We were told our bags would arrive by 1am. They did not. Then we were told they would arrive by 1pm the following day. We called and were told the supervisor was retrieving the bags as we speak. They did not. They lied to us. The flight the bags were supposed to be on was actually canceled. Now we have been told they will arrive later tonight. I highly recommend you to pay a little more and save yourself from being caught in the middle of this clown show.
Singapore to Paris CDG. Its been nearly 5 years since I last flew SIA and although just a single flight so far I was bitterly disappointed. A380 business class section was looking a bit tired seats worn and not the standards I remember. The biggest shock was how poor the cabin staff service was almost from start to finish. Yes they got the service done but there wasnt a single smile or sign of expected service courtesy they appeared bored and wanting to finish as quickly as they could. I fly a lot of other airlines around Asia and whilst many of them have gotten much better in recent times things seem to have gone the other way for SIA. Have the return flight next week and will update after that.
From Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City the plane was an hour late. That stated a chain reaction that culminated in missing our connecting flight to Da Nang. The rescheduled flight was also late amounting to 3 hours overall late. The Premium economy seat was was okay to start with but became more uncomfortable as the journey progressed. The foot rest would not stay up and so I had to wedge my shoe under it to keep it from falling onto my ankle. The recline was difficult to use and I found others struggling to get it to move. The earphones were terrible. The movie selection was also terrible and very limited. There was nothing I wanted to watch. The food was also a bit disappointment given Vietnams reputation for food. As I am into wine again a big let down there was only one white and one red and of very dubious quality. The crew were good. All of these issues are easily solvable it appears cost cutting and some poor management decisions have culminated at the customer end. Vietnam Airlines could be great as they have a great crew but they need to get their act together. My first A350 and a big disappointment
This British Airways trip was one of the worst experiences I have had. The Business Class seating was terrible requiring literally stepping over and sometimes on my fellow passengers. Additionally I was facing backwards while flying. The service was poor food barely edible the lounge lacking in nearly every way from dirty tables torn furniture and lack of power outlets. I suggest doing everything you can to avoid this airline. Their competitors exceed them.
I booked travel from Prague to Paris. The flight was on time when I checked in but then quickly became 2 hours late and actually left 2.5 hours late. No Smartwings personnel at the gate until about 30 minutes prior to departure and there were limited announcements. If you have been travelling internationally the Smartwings baggage allowances are less 15 kilos rather than 20 and a 30 Euro fee awaits those with baggage over the 15 kilo limit. At least the fare was inexpensive.
Route from AUS to PHL to CHO returning on AA. Checkin with 2 checked bags went smoothly. Im AAdvantage Plat. so speed security lines and early boarding. E190 seats in economy are wide and pretty comfortable for a 3 hour flight. No inflight Entertainment but WIFI is available. New commuter terminal at PHL is pretty good also with a new Admirals Club and large food court. Express Dash 8 flight pretty standard almost on time but noisy and bumpy for the 1 hour flight to CHO. Returned on AA was cancelled with about 3 hours notice rebooked on US at 5am the next day. Went to Airport anyway and received a hotel voucher and spent another night. Early flight from CHO meant no airport shuttle so took acb. CRJ200 to CLT PSA CRJ seats are pretty decent much better than Mesa not service what so ever even though almost 50 minutes in the air. Connected to a CRJ900 for the 3 hour flight to AUS. Have taken this in the past with trepidation. CRJs just arent that comfortable with no inflight entertainment and no Wifi. 2 Beverage runs and we were almost on time. Us Airways Express really needs to pad their times some more. All express flight seem to take longer in the air than are scheduled gate to gate. Overall they did the job but still prefer AA.
This airline is an absolute shame in every way. To flee at all costs. Tickets ordered in 2019 for a flight in 2020. Tickets canceled due to COVID but refusal of reimbursement by the company which sends without any explanation and without my agreement vouchers directly following the cancellation emails. A year later at my request these vouchers which are only valid for 1 year are extended a second time because the company refuses reimbursement although promised at the end of the validity date on the pretext that they are in a statute of protection of the firms in bankruptcy and that to obtain a refunding I would have to introduce a procedure near a Czech court Anyway its too late because Im out of time. All this happens via email and with incredible response times when they dare answer because you have to systematically relaunch them. You dont have to be in a hurry with them. We are now at the end of validity of these second vouchers and I realize that Brussels is no longer even offered as a possible airport nor any other in Belgium. I contact them directly by phone in English which they dont speak very well by the way and they explain to me that the vouchers will expire in Oct 2022 that I just have to board at another airport that they serve that they will not reimburse the vouchers and that they will not extend them either. Despite my request my contact explains to me that no one else within the company cant give me more info. In summary Im being had and thats how it is. Two words come to mind thieves and scampers
Mauritius to Manchester via Istanbul. One of the worst airlines I have ever experienced. Staff are rude and unaccommodating. Seats have zero leg room and are so hard its like sitting on a wooden stool for 9 hours Trying to explain that this has aggravated my arthritic spine was pointless. Food is terrible. The wine makes you sick. Not a good airline if travelling long distances or any distance for that matter.
The top of my bag was sheared off the side has some kind of black tar or fuel melted on it that prevents the zipper from opening. My contents were practically spilling out on the baggage belt. When I filed a claim at the airport office they told me I had to call by phone the next day. When I called the next day they said my claim number didnt exist so I had to start a new one. I explained that Im currently in Afghanistan but they insisted that I have to get a repair technician to examine the damage on my bag before a compensation decision could be made which is impossible since I live on a military base. I was then told to submit a claim over email to customer service. I do so and no one responds to me for a week. Im then told that I have to call customer support in my home country. Ive tried to reach them 4 times each time I wait over 30min and never get connected.
I had a flight from Ranchi to Delhi on 12122020 at 2025. My next flight was from Delhi to San Francisco on 13122020 at 430 am in morning. My layover was 6 hours. On 8122020 afternoon Go Air agent called informing that my flight is cancelled and I have two options to choose from Option 1. Cancel flight and get full refund of 2700 INR. Option 2. Book another flight with Go Air which departs at 800 am in morning on 12th and arrives Delhi at 945 am it is only flight which helps me to board my international flight . Which leads to layover of 17 hours during COVID at Delhi airport. This flight cost 8000 INR I requested for hotel accommodationinside or outside airport not a lavish one 2. to pay the difference amount if I book the flight with different airline. The cost of other GoAIR flight offered now is 8000 INR. So the refund is 2700 plus the remaining amount to be paid by Go Air. A supervisor to come on the call. The agent called on 8122020 and said I will get call from supervisor but that didnt happen till 10122020 6 am. Finally I called them and after 2 hours of being in the queue someone answered the call at 8ish am. I explained whole scenario and requested for my requirements. The agent denied to give call to supervisor for different reasons and neither provide me any solution. On top of it the agent gave me a deadline to cancel or reschedule the flight on 10122020. If it was that strict why nobody bothered to call and tell me this for 2 days while I was waiting for a call from supervisor. So here I am concluding to the irresponsible service airlines Go Air. These airlines refunds you in penny if you cancel the flight as they charge the cancellation amount and convenience fee. However they dont pay the cancellation fee when they cancel it. In those cases they are only liable to pay full amount but not the cancellationinconvenience fee. They are ready to give a Go Air flight worth 8000k but not ready to pay 8000 if I book flight with different airlines which reduces my layover time. They are cancelling a flight and in return of it I am getting a layover of 17 hours during pandemic and they are not ready to provide accommodation. A worst airline which is not at all concerned about customer health and behaving with zero responsibility in the name of customer service. Thankyou for the inconvenience and your service
We booked on the BA website round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London in Business Class. Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks we spoke many times with BA Customer Service trying to obtain some kind of refund we were met with contradictory explanations excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as noshows for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned we spent a minimum of 4060 minutes on hold for every phone call we made our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations we were told it was not possible to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a full refund but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits except for the portion for which we noshowed. They did not state how many credits. We never once asked for a full refund we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund. We will not use the credits we were fully refunded by our travel insurance.
LCYEDILCY operated by BA Cityflyer. Excellent flights on the Embraer E170 out E190 back. On time departure and early arrivals on both legs. Complimentary hot breakfast on outbound leg passable at best bar service with a sweet or salty snack on the return more than enough for the 1 hour 10 minute flight. Friendly crew nice modern jets. LCY was busy on the outbound but the airport had opened the overflow ie former screening haul and it took all of 10 minutes from DLR to airside. Edinburgh busy on the return but queues well managed. Accessed BA Terraces lounge in Edinburgh courtesy of my Gold card with Cathay Pacific which was uncrowded with a reasonable selection of food and drink. All in all very good.
Absolutely horrible except for inflight service. The Cathay agents at SFO airports are terrible and have no idea how to help the customers. They are rude and inefficient. My elderly parents were flying to Hyderabad and had a connecting flight at Hong Kong. When we were checkingin they gave us only one boarding pass to Hong Kong telling that the flight from Hong Kong got cancelled and they have sent a mail I never received. I requested the lady at checkin to help my parents find another flight as they cannot stay in airport for 26 hours. She assured me that my parents will be taken care with no options left I had to depart them. Now the nightmare just began on arrival the wheel chair staff took my parents are asked them to wait for 30 minutes they waited and no one arrived. The airline information counter indicated that the connecting flight was cancelled because of few bookings and asked my parents to check with lounges for availability. They had no clue what do and where to go. They satslept on airport chairs for 26 hours. My dad told me that some people who fought with airlines staff were given hotel accommodation and food was provided.
Paris to Fort de France. Level provides cheap long haul fares. You can choose from a number of options during booking including baggage and meal options which raises the prices quite a bit. After booking there was very little spam and hassle. Paris Orly Airport is a bad way to start your holiday. Since we deliberately did not book any food or drink options we brought plenty of foods and drinks and consuming those on board was not a problem. We looked at the food that was pre booked and were surprised how small the portions were. Apart from that everything aboard the plane is on sale you dont get a pillow blanket or headphone but we were prepared for that. Crew running through the aisle serving food and drinks was a tad unnerving. Crew was very strict in enforcing rules i.e one passenger stood up right after landing and crew immediately told him this next time they would call the police on him. The seat was surprisingly comfortable with lots of leg room however we saw quite a few seats with gigantic entertainment boxes in the leg room. Entertainment system was free of charge movie choice seemed rather small for a long haul flight. Internet was available at a hefty price tag. In total Level is a very clear you get what you pay for airline and that is very little on both sides of the equation.
Frankfurt to Tokyo. This airline topped other airlines I have flown with before Before my flight I had a few questions about my booking so I decided to email them. I was surprised that I got answer the following day Same goes for the phonecall. I called since I had a codeshare ticket and the online checkin did not work for me. I expected to be waiting on the line and was so surprised when a very cheerful woman answered after a few seconds It was my first longhaul solo flight and I felt a bit anxious. Without saying anything to the staff they would check on me very often making sure I was comfortable. The staff was very competent and spoke Japanese English and German. The time on the flight to Tokyo passed very quickly thanks to the inflight entertainment.
VX 927 LAXSFO. Uneventful ontime flight good service value for money but free checked baggage only max 14 kg.
Dhaka to New York via Istanbul. The customer service was good. However when flying out of Dhaka the aircraft had an internal temperature of almost 35 Celsius. When passengers started to complain one attendant said that the ac would start when the engine starts to run.
Do not fly KLM Cityhoppers between London City Airport and Amsterdam Both of my flights were either cancelled and delayed What followed next showed an airline that was not only trying to nickel and dime its passengers at every opportunity but also had no clue what the rest of the industry was doing On the day of my departure I received an email informing me that my flight was cancelled and that I would be rebooked on a different flight soon. When I saw the message displayed an option to change flight or request refund I followed the link. Then I realized KLM would charge me extra to change my flight. How ridiculous You cancelled my flight and asked me to pay more to make a change When I called the service center I was told that the flight was not canceled and everything was on schedule. So I went a ahead and checked in online. But when I arrived at the airport LCY the next day the billboard showed my flight was indeed cancelled And I had been rebooked to al later flight. On the day of my return my flight was delayed. So I wanted to catch an earlier flight at the airport. And I had to do this at a service center where there was a long line. My Sky priority status made no difference although KLM displayed two queuesSky priority and General Boarding. I took my number and waited and waited. 30 minutes later the line hardly moved. So I decided to give it a try at the gate. When I reached a KLM gate I was told I would have to pay a fee to change to another flight. How ridiculous You delayed my flight and forced me to stick to the same flight unless I am offering some extra money. And the gate agent could not change my reservation and I would have to go to a transfer center somewhere far in the terminal. And there was not other flight available. In sum I dont remember I ever ran into problems on both flights of a round trip and also was told to pay a fee to change a flight even if it was not my fault. KLM takes no responsibility for its own poor performance. I will do everything possible in the future to avoid flying this airline
Washington to Jeddah via Dubai. I am a fan of Emirates and have flown quite a lot of miles on it. I feel like Emirates quality of service is declining very fast. From check in at the airport in DC IAD the staff were rude insisted that our luggage be exactly 20lbs where is the limit is 23lbbag. The staff in Kabul insisted that I could not take a carry on with me because it was a kilo over the limit whereas I saw others carrying much larger bags than my little carry on bag. They then checked my bag to Dubai instead of Geneva and I had to leave the airport go through the immigration collect my bag take another shuttle and come back to the terminal. What a nightmare. Trying to avoid this airline at all costs now.
The boarding was smooth despite the big crowd of passengers and the flight was quite comfortable. The flight attendant who was in charge of our aisle was super nice and charming and behaved like a Disney princess for the children next to me. I forgot to choose the Moslem Meal option so I was not able to eat the breakfast meal as it contained pork and attendant offered me some fruits and yogurt. Overall it was a pleasant flight.
Manchester to London City. Terminal 3 at Manchester was a nightmare fast track was slow. The lounge was quiet and the lunch offering consisted of soup sandwiches and cheese crackers and crisps together with the usual alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages including champagne on request. There is a view of the runway and taxi way which can be a pleasant distraction. Boarding was called and we made our way to the gate where our Embraer was waiting for us. After about 10 minutes we boarded and made our way down the jet bridge and eventually reached our long legroom seats in row 2 on the right hand side. Hot towels and menus were handed out prior to take off followed after take off by drinks and meal requests. We both had champagne and the bbqd salmon and salad chicken salad was the alternative accompanied by black forest gateau all served together on one tray. Our cabin crew attendant was very attentive and although she helped her colleague to serve economy still managed to provide us with excellent service on this relatively short flight. We landed facing west and quickly disembarked and was in the car park waiting for our car in a matter of minutes. An excellent flight with BA Cityflyer.
Tel Aviv to Munich. Absolutely horrible staff. Asking same questions again and again. Then did extra checks on my suitcase. I had liquids placed inside which were nicely wrapped up. They removed the wrappings and padding when checking the inside of my suitcase. When I opened my suitcase everything was spilled over. In fact from my window seat 40K I witnessed the mishandling of my suitcase. They first threw it on the ground and then threw it on the conveyor belt. I would never fly with this airline ever again.
London to Boston. Amazing flight without a problem arriving on time despite a little late departure. Seat confort was great for economy. Back of seat was very good and leg space seemed above average... seat confort on this A380 seemed better than Emirates A380. Crew was great available and with special attention to kids.
American Airlines had an almost 14 hour delay because of mechanical issues that they knew about the night before the flight. Despite this after waiting 7 hours at the airport I booked another flight as I had to be at my destination the same day. It cost almost double to fly on another airline. Instead of compensating me for the extra expense American has offered only 25 in credit less than 1 per hour of my delay. I have never experienced terrible customer service like this before. Be aware that if there are issues American will leave you high and dry.
I fly a lot and this had to be the worst flight Ive ever been on. The flight was late taking off when I boarded the plan I found out they had given my seat away. I then had to stand at the front of the plane until the entire flight boarded so they could find me an unused seat to which they said Im sure youll be able to stay on this flight. Afterwards due to a mishap with my belongings I had to call the airline company several times. Not only did I have to wait 1520 mins each time to speak to someone they would then proceed to tell me complaints and questions cant be made over the phone.
Lynx air has been horrible from start to finish. Issues booking seats issues paying for luggage and now 2 hours waiting for our luggage from the plane. Theres no help desk no reps to be found anywhere and not much help from chatting online or calling their help line. I was told that a rep would come to me when I was chatting online and gave her my location. But more than 30 minutes later still nothing. Its unbelievable how incompetent this airline is and how horrible their customer service is. Thankfully the pilot at least knew what he was doing and got us to the correct destination safely. Everything else has been disappointment after disappointment. I unfortunately did not book this flight as it was a work trip. If I had I certainly would not ha e booked with Lynx air and I never will.
One cabin crew in my section really lacked finesse. When I pressed the call button to inform him of my broken entertainment screen he came and barked You want something When I asked to read the newspaper the same crew told me I have to wait as he is reading it which he was not it was folded in his hands but I still said okay I will wait hours passed and he never brought the newspaper it was only when a younger crew went through the cabin with water did he realise I had asked for the newspaper and brought it to me without having to ask. Other crew members were extremely friendly and helpful. They were very accommodating and thoroughly enjoyed their job. Especially the two ladies in my section they have very infectious smiles that can brighten anyones mood they truly have good attitude. The food on this leg was better than the going leg. Checkin agent at Singapore was very rude to me.
I booked flights more than 6 months ago to travel from Aberdeen to Norwich around lunch time. A few weeks ago the lunch time flight was cancelled with no explanation and an alternative early morning flight was booked. Having reorganized my plans and booked hotel rooms at Aberdeen airport for the early morning flight we arrived this morning to find the flight cancelled without warning. Now we are due to fly out this afternoon same day. Incredibly frustrating unreliable poor communication and very limited provisions to help us with the delay the people on the service desk were fine but not from the airline and with very little ability to do anything other than provide information and food vouchers.
Plane B737800 in a very good condition and clean. Nice and friendly welcome from crew. Flight was on time and safety procedures were done physically. After takeoff inflight service started after 45 minutes. Crew was offering coffee with pretzel or juice with cookies. There was no IFE but who need it on a such a short flight.
Adelaide to London via Doha in business class. Absolutely fabulous experience flew their A350 to Doha and A380 onwards to London. Ground service was efficient and transfer in Doha was pleasant. A great lounge there but a bit crowded when we can through nice wines and food though. The seats were really comfortable and provided nice privacy and comfortable sleep experience compared to others flown recently. Onboard meals were nice beautifully presented and very good quality with again some really nice wines. Inflight entertainment had a very wide choice of movies and tv programmes and it was just the repetitive adverts that annoyed. Cabin crew were efficient and nice on both flights probably better on the A350 where they didnt seem so rushed. In my opinion this was more comfortable and enjoyable than our usual trip we make with Singapore Airlines and looking forward to our return flights next month.
I have been using BA for a while now and on average I cannot say that I am pretty satisfied. BA somehow experience cancellations and delays most of the time. Second the inflight service is usually weak. Food portions are small and cabin crew is not very helpful especially when it comes to drink requests. The screens in the A380s should be renewed as they are full of scratches and same size as A321s. Especially in longer flights the entertainment system becomes more important. There is also no welcome package except for pillow and small blanket. I would expect more from BA. If you are flying from the US to anywhere except the UK I would recommend considering other airlines. But if you are flying tofrom UK directly then BA could be one of your choices.
DubaiKabulDubai in early December. Kamair continues to be OK. Both flights were close to being on time the only small delay down to Dubai air traffic. They are now doing the luggage security check in Kabul which means you have to point out your case before it is loaded onto the aircraft. Dont forget to do this if you want to see your case at your destination.
I have been a loyal EVA customer for many years. I have earned their Gold Status Infinity MileageLands. I needed to redeem my frequent flier points before the end of June. Thankfully they had extended the expiration date a few times because of COVID19. I decided to redeem the points and fly from Chiang Mai to Vancouver. After being frustrated with doing the online booking myself the Taipei office loyalty kindly phoned me and walked me through the process and everything was perfect. Once in Vancouver I decided to make a trip over to Toronto and I needed to extend my EVA ticket. This time the Taipei and the Chiang Mai office worked together to make that possible for me. I am very grateful to the Taipei office along with Zee and his Chiang Mai office colleagues. Again the onboard service offered by EVA just doesnt get any better. There are little things that make a difference. At the door they check your name on the boarding pass and then greet you by name. Each time they speak to you afterwards they refer to you by name. The FA takes you to your seat. When they speak to you they do not bend down but rather get down to your level and speak to you. When you use the lavatory on the way out they ask you if there is anything that you need. This is really impeccable service. The food is wonderful along with the wines and cocktails. This excellent service is not a oneoff for me but rather what I have experienced before in business class from EVA. When I have had difficulty in the past I have found that the loyalty department at Taipei is most helpful and I can say that same about the Chiang Mai office. I did note that I was not eligible for the free WiFi since I was on an award ticket. That is unfortunate because one receives the points to use an award from being a frequent flier. Again my appreciate to the Taipei loyalty office and Zee and the Chiang Mai staff.
Montreal to Istanbul on TK36. Arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure only to find out checkin had been suspended. Passengers were left waiting in the queues for quite sometime before the TK station manger popped up and told everyone the flight had been cancelled. What ensued can only be described as chaos with agents running around collecting contact information from passengers so that they could be notified of their rerouted itinerary. TK operates three flights per week on this route with the next flight scheduled to leave only on Friday. This resulted in a long and extremely slow moving queue in front of the ticketing counter as two agents tried to reprocess a plane load of people. The rest of the ground staff ran around looking like they knew what they were doing but accomplishing next to nothing. The station manager was nowhere to be found with many passengers demanding answers. As the flight is often the very last one of the day there were no other options left to get the passengers out on the same day with many having to contend with at least a oneday delay. Flight disruptions are an unavoidable part of air travel but TK is not equipped to deal with them as evidenced by the lack of coordination and inefficiency. Their call centre was equally ineffective as they kept saying there was nothing they could do. If TK is well and truly aspiring to become one of the leading carriers they need to significantly pick up their game in customer relations and response to unforeseen events.
Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines. I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 1010. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing which I mean as constructive criticism though I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. Thats fine on the first day after yet another update but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled. Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received.
San Jose to Montreal. The only thing I can say about this airline is they are the poorest in both services In condition of the airplane and customer service I am using different airline more than 7 times a year business related going to different countries and am able to book my seat online 24 hrs ahead of time but interjet is the only airline they technically shove the seats in to their passengers without them knowing it and then when you try to change it to another normal seat not even business or first class they charge you for that. They wont give you this chance to choose your seat at the desk in the airport or online prior to flight. It seems that it is their way of getting money just by booking randomly and rubbing people if they need to seat next to their loved ones or to change it to another regular economy class seat. In the customer service department they are so rude and they just repeating like a parrot without giving any solution that it is airline policy yes this is their policy to rub you so be aware.
Horrible flight from Orlando to Ft Lauderdale NO AIR CONDITIONING. Once airborne the inside cabin rose to 90 degrees. People were sweating in their seats. The flight crew gave out room temperature water. Upon landing they opened the back doors and left everyone standing and waiting 1520 min while they took off the luggage from back of plane. The temperature rose to over 100 degrees children were crying elderly ladies were feeling faint we put water on them and were fanning them with the emergency brochures. When we repeatedly asked if we could deplane first as people were getting sick they said noand the baggage people continued unloading at a slow pace. WHATS WORSE They loaded up the plane with people moments after we got off for the next flight. And they would experience the same horrible flight. This is so disappointing in so many ways. NEVER FLY SILVER AIRWAYS
I have used BA over the past 20 years as I chose to move my airmiles to their plan regretted it ever since and will use them up as soon as possible. Even when flying on a paid flight I find the staff snooty they have a bad customer attitude. At the moment I am trying to check in on a flight only chosen because it was the best option for my multiple stops and the on line check in does not work. Told by staff member never mind just do it at the airport not much point in reporting it because they wont do anything for 24 hours. That is good customer service as you can only check in 24 hours before hand. I have had lost luggage twice on the same trip had my seat changed for no reason someone else was able to use my original choice so not a seat problem flights changed but was able to change them back to the original booking. I have travelled economy and premium economy and flown 10 hours with no inflight entertainment.
Flight was 20 minutes delayed. At Phuket Airport they have a huge single check in line for all the flights it doesnt matter if you do the online check in it takes a long time. You cannot eat your own food on the plane. When we arrived to Bangkok my checked baggage was missing the lock I asked customer service why they removed the lock and if they could give me the lock back and they said that the lock was not found but they didnt understand our English. We decided to go and leave it like that.
This airline is what most people say it takes you from A to B. Dont expect anything more. I traveled from SHJ to TAS first class as there was no available seat in economy. Seats are old fashioned not flatbed but comfortable. Flight was 3.5 hours. Food was good and service was also good. Return was TAS to DXB economy. Seats were good typical for economy. Ticket is expensive around 1100 US economy return considering fight duration but I guess because it is the only airliner which operates direct flight from UAE to Uzbekistan.
Poor customer service. Not preferable If you are travelling along with your family. Cabin crew not providing first preference to family who are travelling along with kid.
A very good service on board this flight with British Airways from LHR to VCE. Although the flight was about 30 minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an Airbus A319 to and Airbus A320 we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time. The crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean probably because the plane was relatively new. The seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room. One small issue that I could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board you had to pay or use Avios it isnt that bad as it was only to Europe. An overall very good experience on board this flight.
LGWGCI. Very good flight no addons like FlyBe etc. Good price online check in free drink and a new ATR72 great value.
In my entire life of flying cheap this is the first airline to ever make me cry out of frustration and feeling beaten up. Not once but twice. Booked a trip from Sydney to Fuzhou via Kunming. I arrived at Sydney airport only to find out that my Fuzhou Kunming has been changed amusingly and amazingly to earlier than my flight from Sydney. Talked to service desk couldnt help gave me a number to call. Called all the numbers he gave none worked. Went on Google and called the number online. They speak Chinese in their automated voicing system. I had to get the guy from the service desk to go through it for me. Eventually answered but staff was so slow and gentle my flight was in 2h. He tried to book my connecting flight 2 days later. I was crying so much begging him that we have schedules booked and everyone will leave me behind. I dont speak Chinese and I dont know anyone. Finally managed to find me a flight the next morning. Put me on hold. Came back half an hour later saying their system crashed. Told me he couldnt help anymore and that I have to hang up and call back and go through the line again. It was 1h before my flight and I still couldnt get my flight confirmed. I was crying so much that the guy at the service desk told me to charge some international calling on my phone and then he helped me call the airline in China. They got it sorted out in like 15min. I went through everything got to the gate and my flight was annouced delay. For the return flight I went to the airport at 4am for my flight back at 7am. The girl at check in counter gave me 5 words of horror We cant find your flight Turned out flight was cancelled ah yes again and have to take the one 5 hours later. Fine. Waited a few hours went to check in again. This time there were 5 other words of horror Your passport number is incorrect. Uhm... Sorry Double checked my booking. My passport was entered correctly. So imagine being by yourself running around China airport trying to get this sorted when they dont speak English. No seriously save yourself the trouble and never fly with this airline. No matter how good their inflight service is it cant compensate all the time and emotions I have wasted on this. Never again. Period. Im cheap but this is way beyond imagination. I am now making sure non of my friends or family is flying with them.
Krakow to London. Got us there fine. My main issue is the food service. I was sat in Row 21 probably 34 of the way back. It was an evening weekday flightso everyone tired hungry. Their new MS service was a disaster. The flight was just over 2 hours. It took 1 hour for the single food trolley to make its way to my row. By the time it arrived all that was available was a KitKat and some other sweets They had already run out of sandwiches hot food. It took a long time because each customer had to pay using credit card and the machine seemed to keep on having problems. Also the variety on the new MS menu whilst generally a good thing meant the staff kept on running back to the galley to replenish clearly still not enough stored. Have to say this services is no better than Easyjet I will think twice about travelling with BA. If it wasnt paid for by work I would not have travelled with them. The service has gone downhill over the years which is a real shame for a national carrier.
The food on this flight was really poor. Lunch was a tough veal chop in gravy desert a gooey chocolate and cherry cake with whipped cream but it was served hard cold and with a miserly speck of cream. The Qsuite is great of course but Air France inflight dining is far superior. In flight entertainment is ok but I dont like movie vision and audio being censored.
Our flight was cancelled a few hours before takeoff and we were informed it was due to flight mechanical issues and that we should receive compensation for our flight not being rebooked until 2 days later and that we would receive an email within 7 days with compensation. It took a while day to rebook everything for our trip including 2.5 hours on the phone with jet blue. After speaking to the representative today 9 days later and still no email she said we were not getting compensation but will not give the full reason why. This cancellation not only interrupted our full trip but incurred late cancellation fees to correct. Since the reason for the cancellation was not a Forced Majeure Event we should be allowed compensation. It is unacceptable. Our return flight was delayed twice as well. No reason given. We were pushed to the last row of the plane since it was rebooked due to the original cancellation and we didnt get seats until we arrived where the stewards were very loudly banging several times throughout the flight startling me and waking up the screaming infant after she finally fell asleep several times. This was the worst experience I have ever had and we fly regularly. We will never use Jet Blue again.
Dont even try this airline the worst ever. Please do yourself a favor do not even try it. 6 hours delayed with 3 kids. Their excuse is no crew available for it. They tried to give me a voucher for 10 dollars for food. Please spend 100 dollars more on your next flight and buy the ticket on another airline.
Business LHR to BKK. 747400. First try back with BA in about 5 years during which I have flown many other airlines and been impressed with most. The only things that impress me with BA are the staff and their ability to pretend this is a quality airline and the fact that people pay BA so much money to be treated like cattle. The Food is without doubt some of the worst I have had in Business anywhere poorly presented badly prepared and barely edible. The AVOD looks like it was installed 10 years ago and then wasnt the top of the range screen size is terrible viewing angles and resolution poor. The seats work well as a lie flat configuration. Thats the highlight. I cant help feel that if BA senior managers occasionally used their own money to fly with rivals then we would see real change from our national flag carrier. Regretting my already booked return flight and my 550000 BA air miles.
Prague to Amsterdam. Extremely rude staff. When i said hello which was their job to say that before me she just rolled her eyes and looked somewhere else without any response. Rest of the staff was rude as well but this was something Ive never experienced while flying in my life.
I fly regularly with Binter between Las Palmas and Tenerife. I find the airline generally punctual except for extreme weather conditions usually at Tenerife North and the staff very attentive. Fares can be pricey but if you choose your flight times during the day you can get some good deals. Occasionally I have flown with Islas Airways but have found them unreliable and subject to flight cancellations which has been most inconvenient. Their ground staff also tend to be uncommunicative.
I really like Saudia. My 20th flight with them in 6 months all without exception were on time crew always cheerful and willing to serve and a really nice lounge in Jeddah.
The Portuguese carrier staff since years has worsened its onboard services.While other airlines are improving their services TAP is decreasing the quality. Flight TP016 from REC to LIS 2 hours of delay on 13.01.2023 in business class. No one aspect of the whole service can be claimed as business service. The RECLIS route is the only direct service from Recife to Europe. TAP is a monopolistic carrier. If you want to fly to REC with other airlines you need to go through GIG or GRU. The flight then becomes very long. When you fly to REC with TAP they do not care at all. No competition no service improvement. No welcome drink once a board Very poor menu. The breakfast is even worst than the dinner. A tiny small of fruit salad and a small plate with two slices of cheese and one of Brie type of cheese.Half slice of very low quality ham not edible at all and one slice of salami. I asked for a coffee with milk and they tried to give me powder milk. After a complaint the normal milk appeared and was served directly from the box. Bread selection out of any comment Unfriendly and rude staff. The staff is always in a rush when they have to serve the meals. After the fast services they start chitchatting behind the curtains. They dont smile at all. It looks they are going to a funeral. The toilets have No difference with the Economy one. No hand cream nor refreshing towel or other little amenities. The internet connection was not available The only positive thing that cannot offset the whole bad service is the lieflat bed. Thats all
London to Banjul via Casablanca. Left Heathrow on timefull flight for Casablanca evening meal served tasty beef stew. Left Casablanca for Gambia this time I chose chicken out of the same two options as the London flight. Cabin crew efficient and we landed on time. Return trip another 737 left at 2 am for Casablancaplane full and on timeserved a strange boxed mealsnack. Long wait at Casablanca 6 hrs plus as per scheduleairport is new booked the lounge to wait nothing specialbut the airport itself was clean and bright. Last flight Casablanca to London delayed a bit because of storm Dennis they served a hot meal which was OK. Landed late but safely having stacked at Heathrow waiting for storm and other aircraft to land. Although all flights were 737800 the vintage and layout of each was different but legroom was ok no individual screens on them. Not a bad series of flights crews were seasoned and unobstrusive.
I had flown with TAM in several occasions and I had a good experience before I cant say the same in this case their customer service is awful we had to wait one hour in the business check in counters because nobody was there. After one hour there they told us that our flight which was international had to be attended in the domestic flights area and after another half an hour waiting there they werent able to introduce our rewards card into the system. I dont why but after almost two hours trying to make the check in we only wanted to leave. Worst ground service ever.
Flew march 1214 on JP from ZRHLJUZRH. The flights were on time the flight attendants nice and helpful. The sandwich has got an upgrade and is now equal to LH. A Minus point was that they were handing out only Apple Juices if you wanted to have wine or other drinks you had to ask specifically for it. This gives me kind of a cheap impression as it seems to the passenger that they wanted to hide it from them. The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country. I absolutely agree that on such short legs there is no necessity of any fooddrinks however either this is clearly defined in the service guide of the airline or then crews should adhere to their service guidelines.
Turkish Airlines cancelled the leg IST to MBA on my YYZ to MBA flight via IST. They had not flown this route IST to MBA since Mar 2021 and yet in Mar 2022 they sold this flight and eventually cancelled it without providing a reroute. The only option was a refund. However the flights were now 1.1K more expensive per person and we were four so the cost was 4.4K more expensive for us to fly to our destination and back. We ended up cancelling and taking a refund. This was devastating because we had saved for this trip and had booked so many local destinations and all the money for those local excursions was wasted but it was easier to lose already paid money than to pay an additional 4.4K for new tickets. Turkish Airlines is terrible for having done that and in fact we found out that they had been doing this since Christmas of 2021 i.e. selling tickets for the route IST to MBA and then cancelling it without consequence i.e. only a refund.
Worst experience of all. When flying from Amsterdam to Berlin there was more than 2 hours of delay but they did not give any compensation drink vouchers which was stated in the Terms Conditions. On my way back there was another delay of an hour due to which was triggered by their technical fault. The cabin crews were extremely unfriendly I will for sure say that I will never take EasyJet again.
I had a very bad experience with Go first. I booked a connection flight from Delhi to Kannur via Mumbai. Two days prior to the flight date i have got a message saying theres a delay in the flight from Delhi to Mumbai. When I checked the rescheduled time Gofirst has provided me a very unrealistic connection flight time in such a way that my first flight will reach Mumbai five minutes after the second flight departure from Mumbai. When I contacted their customer care they didnt even provide any solution. So I asked them if i can cancel the first flight and board second flight from Mumbai. Then they denied it saying flight is overbooked The flight which I have already booked with full payment. The same flight available online with a higher amount at same time. When I questioned it they said they will consider my partial cancellation but still they havent get back on the refund status. So I had to book another flight to reach Mumbai and board the second flight. Never going to choose go first again
Mumbai to Bengaluru. This is the first time I flew AirAsia but I had a wonderful experience. I normally feel sick during takeoff and landing but I loved the smooth takeoff and landing. Would love to fly only in AirAsia henceforth. Thank you
We flew from Singapore to Manchester on Sunday 28th October and can honestly say it was the best economy flight we have travelled on. Very comfortable seats tasty food and snacks Exceptionally clean toilets and most of all a great cabin crew.
American promises that they keep their planes clean especially during COVID. The seat in front of mine was obviously filthy and had been for some time. The headrest had a layer of built up dead skin there was popcorn on the floor and there was a dirty water mark above my head. None of these obvious things had been cleaned in quite some time. I actually touched the seat in front of me and felt the greasy build up on the headrest. Its unbelievable that American Airlines would lie about their cleanliness. I have pictures to prove all my claims.
Cheap and certainly NOT cheerful. This airline is the worst airline I have ever flown. If you are not extremely early in arriving at the checkin desk they refuse to provide you with your ticket unless you take a trip across the airport to a tax office and pay a fee of 30 Euros. They claim that this is a fee for late checkin. The office where I had to pay the fee does not accept card payments. I therefore had to travel again to another side of the airport to an ATM wasting more time. All in all it took me half and hour to sort this and I only made the flight because it was delayed. Also when paying the fee in Turkish Lira they then upthe price even further without telling us beforehand. So we paid more in Turkish Lira than we would have paid in Euros despite this being Turkey. The price for late checkin is 30 euros per person. I thought it was suspicious when I was booking my ticket online and they automatically add pointless extras for an extra cost without you having asked for them so you have to navigate back through the booking form to uncheck all of the boxes.
RNOLAX via San Jose. No checked baggage just carryon so checked in online and off to the gate. TSA in Reno has the new scanners so you dont have to remove your electronics from your baggage. Nice Flight was running 30 minutes late but we were well informed of this. Light passenger load to San Jose so room to move around. Usual beverage and snack service. Quick stop in San Jose was lengthened to an extra 30 minutes as waiting for arriving passengers to board from another flight. it was understandable as it was about 20 passengers. Still a light load with only half the seats filled onwards to LA. Another beverage and snack service. Arrived into Los Angeles about half an hour late. From landing to driving out of the airport was only 20 minutes so made up time that way. All in all a good experience with pleasant flight and ground crew. As usual we have the best luck with Southwest out of Reno.
KLM from Tel Aviv to Amsterdam direct with their typical plane for this season of travel on this line the Boeing 777200ER. The flight was delayed by around one hour it was the infamous day of July 56 where Schiphol had a severe storm that caused the delay and cancellation of hundreds of flights. Ours was luckily delayed only by one hour because the flight before departed later from Amsterdam. Boarding was not done using zones. People started gathering around the gate standing around 20 minutes before boarding even started. I The flight itself was pretty chill the crew was very professional and comforting. The breakfast that was given was fruit salad yogurt and a hot drink. It was okay for an early morning flight. Landing at Schiphol was smooth. My only complaint would be the width of Economy class seats. I am no small person but also not super large. And yet I found that the seats were really narrow even for thinner people than me. It felt as my hands could only go on the table or that I would need to cross them in order not to touch the other person. Also seats were lacking padding they were pretty thin. After one hour of seating my tail bone started aching and I had to move in my seat every 30 minutes and change my position. I would like to praise though the KLM crews service and proffesionalism always greeting with a smile always helpful.
Within 15 hours after booking I had to cancel ie well within the 24 hour cancellation window. First of all virtually impossible to get hold of anyone. Eventually tried Facebook Messenger as recommended on th LOT website. Took almost an hour to cancel the ticket after which I was informed that it would tale up to 47 working days to receive the refund. Never ever experienced a similar lack of service level. This was without any doubt the first and last time I considered flying with LOT.
Vistara has for some time been the benchmark in Indian aviation with amazing service and attentive staff. Unfortunately due to personal issues I was unable to fly for the last 4 months of so and was happy to be back in the air for a trip to Delhi on Vistara. I blocked the first row of economy class since the fare difference between economy and premium economy was quite high for the travel date. While the ground experience remains consistently good pre and post boarding. the inair experience in economy has been quite degraded. For a morning 6 am flight Vistara did not offer teacoffee in economy class. The breakfast was very poor and my omelette was inedible. No condiments except a small roll and butter on offer. Now coming to the Club Vistara program. I called up Vistara 2 weeks prior to my flight as I had 2 Upgrade vouchers and wanted to use one and asked them to recommend a flight on which I could use my upgrade voucher any flight and ok with either Eco to Prem Eco or Prem Eco to Business and I was told that no upgrades available even 2 weeks before flying. Imagine my surprise that i could see at least 23 empty seats in premium economy in the flight i was traveling in.
I never write a review for any product or service but feel forced to this time around. I was massively dehydrated asked for water 3 to 4 times but was never served water by the attendant. After 2 hours or so I was served water by another attendant. I had to pay to get a blanket and the attendant never returned me the change despite requesting twice. Only when the flight was about to land is when I reminded her again and thats when I got the 45 dollars I was owed. It didnt look like she was planning on giving me the change had I not reminded her again. The attendant kept ignoring my requests and constantly asked me to wait.
London Heathrow to Larnaca. Perfect. The early morning departure meant that Terminal 5 was unusually quiet. The Galleries Lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment. The flight took off and landed on time. The cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experience. Arrival procedures at Larnaca were incredibly efficient. We completed immigration and picked up our hold baggage within 30 minutes of arriving at the gate. All in all a very enjoyable trip.
Amman to Cairo. I arrived in Cairo in nov 6 to find out my luggage was no where to be found. They made me fill out a form Where I needed to buy an Egyptian sim so they can call me. I emailed them the documents as instructed. Ever since then no one has replied to my calls or emails. My tour guide was able to get through somehow. They delivered me a bag but it was not mine But with my name. Its been 5 days since I arrived and I have called them every day and emailed them continuously. Still no reply. I had to resort to commenting in their social media to get their attention and I finally got a reply and now they are replying but even then nothing has been escalated. Definitely an airline with very bad service I would not recommend.
This was my first time flying with British Airways from Los Angeles to London Heathrow. I was able to secure a window seat for myself without paying any fee during online checkin 24 hours prior to departure. The baggage dropoff experience at LAX and LHR was smooth. At LAX the BA staff tags your checkin bags at LHR you have to do it yourself. The onboard experience was good. This was my first time sitting on the upperdeck of A380 which had a special storage bin by the window armrest. Food options were consistent with what you find on most transatlantic flights Chicken or Pasta. There was no WiFi but BA had a good collection of movies. I enjoyed BAs inflight movie snack as well. The Flight Map Tracker wasnt working on one segment which was a bit surprising. Overall I had a pleasant experience and would consider flying with BA again.
Dubai to Mumbai our flight was delayed by 1 hour from airport and we missed our connecting flight and we were taken to Jet Airways counter by the staff and waited more then 2 hours for them to decide and finally they offered us another flight after 9 hours via Muscat which was not acceptable at all and the staff were rude. I explained that we are traveling from last 9 hours and we are tired and we needs some place to rest but directly they refuse saying do whatever you like we cant provide place to rest and also said that if you make noise they will call police and through me out of airport so this is what we paid for. I will never recommend Jet Airways.
LGWZAGPUYZAGLHR. Used Croatia Airlines before and staff attitude and friendliness has changed a lot. On all flights smiley and polite crew. Catering has got worse now a piece of cheese strudel given although very tasty with 4 small pieces of honey cake on the side. On 2hr flight drinks offered only once but refilled if asked. On A319 new Recaro seats which are not very comfortable but ok for short flight. On return from ZAG 1 hour delay which was explained and apologised for. The only minus really was baggage handling at LHR waited for over 45 minutes for bags. Good airline offering good product.
Bangkok to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. Very bad customer service Lady at the airport behind the customer helpdesk looked like she was mad at me for not understanding her bad English. Added luggage through their website but the ticket number was wrong and they would not allow me to check in my bags under my name unless I pay 4 times the normal amount I refused and had to take stuff out of my bag to get under 7.5 kg and leave it on the airport Thank you but never again Malindo Air
Bangkok to Yangon. The check in was very easy and quick the plane was clean all the staff were really friendly and helpful the flight was on time. I would definitely fly again with Nok Air.
The worst company I have ever seen. Took 100 for one baggage suit when their website write it cost 50. Also small child took a seat a lot of rows apart. Manager was very rude and said its your problem. I cant do something
Maputo to Doha. Service is always good with online checkin to beat the queues in many airports. A little more expensive than other airlines in the region but they fly point to point rather than hubs and transfers which I prefer. Online services good as is their loyalty programme although you need to progress to the next tier first before you get anything. Generous baggage and seating space on aircraft is good although the aisle is narrow and passengers not looking where they are going can easily hit other seated passengers with their bags. Cabin crew are superb and helpful and if you get them a box of chocolates for the journey they are genuinely pleasantly pleased. The food is normally good as is the choice of beverages on offer. The entertainment system has some good movies but often has problems working properly. Customer services is absolutely awful with many queries not answered or the staff point you to the webpage information where you said you didnt understand what was on the page.
I called the contact number on their website. The lady that answered seemed very angry. I asked about a refund I have been waiting for for ages. She went like just wait why are you in hurry I asked if I could speak to someone else who could help she said no. No one can help you. I called multiple times and every is worse than the other. The last person connected me to a said supervisor. The supervisor hang up to my face. It is both funny and frustrating how they treat their customers. What kind of management do they have Its really appalling At the airport they are just as rude.
Aircraft was changed which meant I did not have an aisle access and would have to climb over someone to get out of my seat. They should have informed of this change to give us time to make other arrangements. In the end crew changed me to a seat with no one next to me but by the wing having had 1K. Crew was brilliant and apologetic but they should have told us. Food was mediocre. I do not see why they are a 5 star airline.
By far the worst airline Ive ever deal with I would not take another of their flights not even for free. In 2023 an international flight with no electric outlets and seats that dont recline. To avoid at all costs.
Germanwings took over the service on Dusseldorf Basel route from Lufthansa. I am a business traveller and normally book my flights 2 weeks in advance. I flew with Lufthansa for 1 year. Since Germanwings took over the average price of tickets has increased for me by 50. With Lufthansa prices were between 180300 euros with Germanwings there are almost never
Brussels to Bangkok via Doha in April and Qatar Airways is a top airline The most aspects of our journey were goodgreat. We had no transfer problems at all although the transfer time was limited 1h45. We checked in via web twice but the queues for us in Brussels as well in Bangkok were longer than those who had not checked in via web. There were far more check in desks opened for customers who had not checked in so our waiting time was to long. The cabin crew was very friendly especially for our kids. The inflight service and meals are very good. It was just a bit disappointing that the choices for the main course were limited when they came by. Overall were satisfied with Qatar Airways.
Singapore to Taipei. Fantastic Airline. Clean aircraft comfortable seats nice touch with Hello Kitty theme service was impeccable with professional attitude always with a smile. They use the Singapore Airlines lounges in Singapore which are great. Food quality and presentation is excellent.
Detroit to Bangalore via Paris. The worst ever plane travel I experienced. My baggage was lost and no still proper communication regarding my missed items. I was asked to wait for 21 days to track my baggage. I had email communication until 21 days and after it seems to be have lost I am not getting replies to email. Didnt provide genuine phone no to contact when my baggage was lost. I have tried more than 100 times to Customer care phone number I was not able to speak to representative I dont know could they be so irresponsible when someones else properties have been lost And coming to the flight ridiculous service inside the plane Uncomfortable seating LCD display didnt work at all. Paid 1050 for a single way and not worth even a penny. I have to spend extra money for my lost items on top of it. Too much of money and energy wasted because of this journey
The state of the aircraft being dirty is unacceptable and reflects poorly on maintenance and hygiene standards. The cramped seats made it uncomfortable to move or eat without squeezing yourself which is not ideal for a longhaul flight. The quality of the food served to me on the flight was disappointing with the breakfast roll being inedible and a lack of choice of juices was also inconvenient. The fact that only red wine and beer were available as beverages is surprising and not having any other options is a major letdown.
Initially a bit skeptical as we had never flown with Lao Airlines before. Turbo prop aeroplane with very comfortable seats and lovely cabin crew. It was a clean and modern plane. Much more economical than the other choice of airlines to Luang. Would recommend Lao Airlines.
My husband my daughter and I were scheduled to travel with Jetblue from LAX to New York JFK on June 25 2023 at 545 am with arrival at 220 pm. We were scheduled to fly out of new York JFK with Norse Atlantic at 620 pm to London Gatwick. We received an automated call at 12 am on June 25th along with an email that our JetBlue flight was canceled. The recording stated that we would be flying at 1157 pm from Ontario to JFK with arrival at 820am on June 26 2023 . That meant that we would miss our flight to London. We got on the phone waited a half hour to be connected to a jetblue agent in Rwanda who after 45 minutes of researching told us that the best she could do is to refund our money as she was unable to offer any other solutions. we asked to speak to a manager. we waited for 2 hours before giving up and accepting a refund. We had to rebook our entire vacation and connecting flights and hotel in Europe in 3 hours. It cost us extra 2500 usd to change our vacation. Later this week I found that the reason for cancellation was Crew legality which means they were short on pilots Who did their scheduling I will never fly with JetBlue ever again. Stay away from JetBlue. They will surely screw you.
Manchester to San Francisco via Heathrow. First time flying with British Airways and will most certainly be my last. 11 hour flight from London Heathrow to San Francisco on a very very tired looking Boeing 777200 was not what I had expected. IFE system was sparse in choice and colour pixels on the screen. Couldnt sit with my partner as unlike most leading carriers BA opt for a system of charging if you want to reserve a seat before check in opens When check in did open we were assigned seats miles apart and the plane was fully booked so 11 hours of no real IFE and the option to talk to my partner involved a 5 minute walk across the plane. We could have opted to go with Virgin cheaper but decided it would be nice to go with BA. Who as far as I can work out are on Ryanairs level of additional charges. Never again British Airways never again
Not a bad price but little choice of airline as BA dont fly this route. Essentially Germanwings is the low cost wing of Lufthansa and it shows. Unruly boarding. No inflight catering at all weak and tasteless tea for 2.50 On the other hand flights reasonably punctual though outbound was 20 mins late.
Prague to Brussels. When traveling with my luggage and a small laptop bag they tried to charge me 45 and force me to put one of them in the hold. They stated that this policy is clearly mentioned when you but the flight but I disagree. It was not clear and its completely unfair. The laptop bag fits under the seat so its not a matter of space but a trick to scam users. The ironic part is that I was able to put my laptop bag inside the luggage and they didnt have problems me carrying my laptop and a book inside the plane. When I bought the ticket another Airline Brussels Airlines had same prices on the same route and almost identical schedules. Its clear which airline I will fly with next time.
Aberdeen to Humberside via Durham Tees. Once again I have been let down by this Mickey Mouse airline. They are the biggest burglars charging 1st class rate for what I wouldnt even call a second class service. An example 480.00 return from Humberside to Aberdeen you can fly New York at that rate. Been delayed over 2hrs this week 2hrs last week due to technical issues real reason is they are cramming all on the last flight due to lack of demand. Bring on Logan Air give them a run for their money and get them closed down.
I like Air Asia for been a good low cost airlines. But when you have an issue the problem are starting and you will find nobody at the end for a solution or at least an answer. Air Asia changed the flight schedule by 5 hours and this was not compatible with my holidays. So I asked for a refund on Dec 2. On Dec 16 I went through the long and inefficient talk with robot AVA until I get in the queue for a human agent with n90. After an hour I got an answer your refund will be done in 2 days. On Dec 20 after playing again with AVA for half an hour I was granted to the queue with number 144. And after 2 questions the chat was terminated by the agent or and I still not get and answer. But every time the claim case was solved. I guess this is a great satisfaction for Air Asia to close claims without answering their customer. In fact AVA was better than the agent but both are inefficient. So I gave up with AVA and called the phone voicemail service for Air Asia Thailand. I explained my case and after 24 hours still waiting for a call back when it should have been done in 24 hours. But for urgent case I can contact AVA joke. Form this experience I notice that the customer service at Air Asia is nonexistent but also when you consider the price of the ticket must check everything seat luggage food Air Asia is no more advantageous compare to a normal airlines like Malaysia Airlines or Thai. And for a small difference of the fare you can talk to a real agent instead of a stupid robot and incompetent agents. For the future I will be careful before booking at AirAsia since this company reschedule and cancel flights many times since the start of COVID and the new normal.
Philadelphia to Denpasar Bali via Doha. Before choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali I studied many many reviews of a number of different airlines which led to my choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali. I booked these tickets myself online so was a bit anxious about any hitches that might occur since this was the first time for both a flight of this magnitude and my unfamiliarity with this airline. I am so very happy I chose them because of the many flights I have taken both inside the US and internationally Qatar Airways currently has my vote as the best for service for seating and for overall efficiency and pleasant travel. Checkin both in the US and in Bali was exceptional Fast efficient and friendly. I am mobilityimpaired and need a wheelchair for distances in the airport. I cannot stress the exceptional quality of care that was given to me from the point of entry into the Qatar area. Not only in terms of fast friendly transport through checkin customs security and onto the planes but once I was entered into their system as mobilityimpaired at the first airport we were upgraded to more comfortable seating very helpful. Service on the planes was impeccable. Staff was friendly attentive note these were almost 13 and 10 hour flights so staff were on for long hours to requests and periodically checked even if no requests were made. I preordered meals not necessary I discovered unless you really do want special meals and was able to change the request while inflight. Meals both vegetarian and nonvegetarian options were tasty on the way out particularly featured a lot of protein were plentiful and beautifully served. Since when on US flights do we get served with real silverware Plenty of individual entertainment options a nice seat pack that included eyeshades ear plugsand other goodies good blanket good earphones etc. Kids get special treatment with extra goodies and maybe as a result or else we had exceptional parents babies and children both ways little crying or loud kiddie noises during these long exhausting flights. I could go on and on but suffice it to say I look forward to flying Qatar Airways again and am recommending it to people I know as an excellent option. I have no clue as to what happens in business and first class but I would say have no qualms about booking economy seats on Qatar Airways. One additional thing Next time I intend to make a stopover in Doha especially on the way back because flying to Southeast Asia seemed easier than the return maybe due to time differences we had actually been awake much longer. But also because Doha looks fascinating. I will at the least plan a longer layover because from the airport on can actually get 3 or 5 hour city tours. There is an airport hotel but it is also easy to arrange to stay over for a day or two. Just check it out.
London to Athens. We were fortunate to get exit row seats in advance. They were spacious with plenty of legroom. They had more width than the cramped Boeing 747400 that we had just flown in on. We each had a carry on however during the transit process British Airways ground staff made us check one of our carry on bags. I have no idea what criteria they used to select passengers to check their carry on bags. Bare bones service no meals which is okay no complimentary soft drinks or water. Bottled water was available for purchase. In hindsight we would have been better off flying on Aegean Airlines.
Worst airline experience ever. Always delayed dont rearrange flights until you land and may not offer a next flight can be delayed several days. Customer service is poor staff barely speak English and have poor manners. Istanbul airport is a mess staff dont speak English huge airport that is difficult to navigate. They dont honor the seats you pay for on the airplane. Never flying again.
ZRHLASZRH for business reasons as it was a direct flight. Never again in economy. The plane had a delay for 10 hours due to technical reasons. That could happen. I prefer to fly safely but after these 10 hours waiting no extra drink onboard. All we got was a piece of paper explaining the problem. Im 188 cm tall and I cant recommend economy class for people who need some legroom and have to sit there for 12 hours. The crew was very friendly but could not change anything as the flight was fully booked. Next time I will fly via SFO.
I booked premium economy because I have knee problems. The seats are just OK shell type that slides down but not built for a person over 6 feet and the food is the same as economy although it was the best fish I ever had on a plane. Overall a very decent product and the flight was on time. They lost my luggage so I did not have winter clothing as it was summer in South Africa. I bought what I needed for 240 and Air France reimbursed me within 10 days. Overall very satisfied and impressed by the no fuzz reimbursement.
Sydney to Singapore. We are very disappointed that we arrived 5 hours before the departure to get seats in row 30s and we were told its all full. As we are older people in early 70s. We were told we should select our seats by Internet. We checked 48hrs before departure online however all seats were allocated the seats available were the same seats open 48hrs ago. What a shame that airline has no remorse to senior people. We are seating in toilet class row 56s. As seniors we make two or three trips a year however we havent encountered this situation in our travelling time. Manager was not considerate or seriously shown any interest. Remember sorry does not make pain go away. I will advise the all the family and friends not to travel Singapore Airlines in future.
Warsaw to London. Everything went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked about this flight. Professional crew with beams on their faces new aircraft its important to choose a seat no further than row 14 in A321neo as those seats are the old type Pinnacle seats and have better legroom very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off very much appreciated on time landing and good atmosphere on board The food in Euro Traveller is unfortunately no longer free however being in BAs Executive Club you can pay for the food drinks with avios which is very convenient. The only drawback I could find is a long queue to the bag checkin at Warsaw Airport 3 opened checkin counters for approx. 200 people is rather not enough.
Tokyo to Beijing. First the ANA lounge was very nice. There was a sushi bar but I did not try due to a long queue. The noodle bar was more than enough to keep me happy. There was no flatbed seats but that was quite adequate for a regional flight. Service was good. Inflight meal was fine but was not as good as on ANAs longhaul flights.
Singapore to Toulouse via Paris. We booked our yearly flight to France through Air France this requiring Singapore Airlines to take us on the first leg from Perth to Singapore. As we left the Singapore flight we were met at the aircraft door and taken in a motorised vehicle from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1 to board the Air France flight. We were taken to the First Class Lounge and when boarding was to take place we were again driven to the gate lounge where we were escorted to the front of the security queue. We quickly cleared security and were escorted to our seats 1EF. The service we received on board was better than we have ever received with any other airline. The seat transformed into a wide and long full flat very comfortable bed. On reaching Paris DG we left the plane and were guided via a secured doorway to a waiting limousine whereupon we passed through private security and immigration. We were the only people there this process taking about 3 minutes. After being escorted to the First Class lounge where we waited we were picked up by limousine just before takeoff of the Toulouse flight and driven to the waiting aircraft again bypassing all the queues. What we appreciated more than anything else was being expertly guided through all the airports and at each stage being advised that our checked in bags had been located and were confirmed as being on the flight with us a relief because we have previously lost bags on other airlines. We dont particularly like Airports and flying but if you have to do it this Air France experience well exceeded our expectations absolutely superb
Flew Air France from London Heathrow to Mauritius via Paris. Shocking service from the word go definitely not trying at all to make our booking experience or flight nice. One person serving at check in desk meant a 90 minute queue and a rush to board the flight horrible start to the holiday when we got there early
Buying this as a codeshare from American was the first of many mistakes. Premium Economy on American allows you to pick a seat but as a codeshare Iberia prevents seat selection except for a price not disclosed when buying on American. American tried their best to help but to no avail. Even OneWorld HQ in London could get no response from Iberia. I was told repeatedly by Iberia just to go to the airport on the day of the flight. On the flight I was offered a dinner choice of beef or pasta my beef was the toughest I have tried cutting. The crew seemed happy among themselves but otherwise dispirited. A sad change from the days when one boarded an Iberia flight and felt that one was instantly transported to Spain. Despite the nonstop convenience from Boston to Madrid I would rather take another airline and have a better experience for the money.
Copenhagen to Prague. CSA Czech Airlines is the worst company Ive ever dealt with. 2 of 3 flights I experienced with this carrier were connected with some inconvenience delayed flight misinforming help desk mean behaviour eshop that changes prices when you press pay. I can recommend just one thing dont fly with them even if it means to pay a little more. The stress you might undergo is not worthy of the possible saving.
I traveled from Sharjah to Doha and Doha to Sydney in Qatar Airways business class. The business class seat and Doha business class lounge is very comfortable and perfect. Meal is very delicious with acceptable options. Also the A380 lounge is opened during flight from Departure to arrival with very friendly staff.
Gatwick to Larnaca. I was shocked with the treatment of staff at Gate 1 right before our departure. I had already checked in my 20kg luggage and had my cabin luggage weighted at the check in before a cabin luggage sticker was placed on my cabin bag. Upon arriving at Gate 1 a member of staff Becca weighed our cabin luggage together with our laptop bags and the total weight for each of us was 12kg instead of 8kg. Okay I understand that we were overweight but she then asked for my credit card that I made my booking with. At that time I thought that she wanted to confirm my booking so I gave it to her. She then told me that she wasnt able to get a payment from my card. She tried to charge me without telling me She insisted 34 times and was very rude. She took my credit card from my hands and when I was asking her of what she was doing I didnt get a reply Really is this your customer service She told me the extra charge was 65 but then charged me 130 Without telling me and I saw it as soon as I boarded the plane Why were we treated like that As we were the last people to board the plane we payed 130 for that extra 4kg so that we didnt cause any further delay of the airplanes departure. I personally felt insulted and found her behaviour impolite and disrespectful.
The gentleman in their London office I dealt with on the phone when making the booking was extremely helpful in explaining the various options to me. On the security front I was comfortable as xrays and sniffer dogs were employed at the departure gate. Both flights departed and arrived on time and were comfortable. The food especially on the return flight was more than passable. The onboard service was excellent nothing too much trouble for the cabin crew even when dealing with the incessant demands of the spoilt brat male passenger in front of me who I would happily have throttled. These were the most pleasant flights I have made in years.
Sapporo to London Heathrow via Tokyo Haneda with Japan Airlines. Incredible crew nice and helpful. International and Japanese food better than BA with metal cutlery in economy class. Free snacks in economy simple but better than nothing. Seats on longhaul flights have a lot of knee space with cool canvas seats very good customizable headrests with foldable sides so you can fix your head when sleeping good pillows entertainment system about the same quality but maybe BA had more choice. Domestic flight with B777200 configuration 343. JAL looks more tailored to Japanese customers they have all major japanese beers Asahi Sapporo Kirin etc. Very pleasant experience even on a full flights combination of good seats good food and good crew.
Club World from LHRORD. Busy flight on the ageing 747400. Seats comfortable as always and a calm cabin on the Upper Deck. Only fault were the crew. They seemed just out of training school. Although very pleasant and friendly the two made quite a few mistakes with orders and drinks and appeared nervous. Flight left and landed on time. An all together good experience.
Johannesburg to New York. During flight entertainment system was out of order which made this 15 hours journey extremely unpleasant. In addition air temperature in the cabin was very high and crew were unable to adjust it to the comfortable level. Looks like this aircraft if very old and never was refurbished. One can experience bad service unpleasant situation delay or break down during air travels. It happened to me on quite a few occasions but every time carrier involved responded to complain and at least apologised promising improvements. Unfortunately this is not how SAA works. My complaint remains unanswered for over 2 months.
Berlin to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. Check in at TXL was smooth. We were bussed to a A330 for the first leg to IST. The IFE screens were not working for half of the seats in the main cabin. Also not during the safety instructions and I was shocked to see that the cabin crew did not ensure passengers were given a demonstration instead or checked if seat belts were fastened and specific rows were cleared of hand luggage. The crew could also learn a bit more English and be a bit friendlier overall. ISTKUL was on a Boeing 777 and certainly more comfortable. The crew was more present is TK a hit or miss The IFE is great when it works and they certainly serve excellent food IST is a nightmare but thats another review.
Anjouan to Dzaoudzi. A very small airline and the only airline based in Comoros. Checkin was disorganised because of locals with big packages and disinterested staff. The flight was fortunately short 30 mins. Took off on time and landed on time. With a short flight like there was of course no inflight entertainment nor cabin service except for biscuits and a bottle of water which was quite nice
Toronto to Dubai flight the A380 was comfortable and smooth with 10 abreast seating. For ultralong flights the A380 and A350 are my perfect choice with small premium. Service on board and IFE system was decent and flights left on time. Check in was breeze even for economy in Toronto. Some passengers have extra luggage weight and airline was strict in enforcing the limit.
The service was great from every step. The check in process was easy and the attendant was patient and polite. The flight attendants were welcoming and prompt. My ticket included checked luggage at no additional charge. I will consider Thai Smile in the future when flying.
MiamiNassauHavana. Check in at Miami couldnt understand our tickets although I printed tickets that Bahamasair send to me. At the checkin in Miami they told us that we need to get off the plane before the connection flight and do the checkin again. When the plane took off we asked it from the crew and they said we couldnt do it again and we needed stay on the plane. When we arrived to Havana there was nice surprise for me. They had left my baggage to Miami I wasnt the only unfortunate one they had left 18 baggage to Miami. I had to wait 4 days for my baggage and the airline didnt even send the baggage to me when it arrived to Havana. I had to pay taxi and go get it by myself from the airline. If you seek some email addresses from their website you see that there is none of them. They have just phone numbers so you have to call to them if you have any questions concerning your bookings or flights.
Pleasant flight from Copenhagen to Kuala Lumpur via Doha and vice versa. I had been looking forward Qatar Airways flight and I got exactly what I had been dreaming of. Absolutely perfect staff always helpful polite and nothing was problem. Aircraft was clean and IFE food and beverages was excellent. In summary everything was excellent. I look forward to my next flight with Qatar Airways.
Boarding in Istanbul delayed more than two times. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. Meal was ok main course with 3 choices. Entertainment ok with many movies available. Arrival delayed by almost 1 hour. Luggage delivery within 40 minutes.
Paris to Sydney via Shanghai. By far the rudest and most unprofessional experience I have ever encountered with airline and customs staff I used the bathroom when we boarded the plane only to find that the toilet was dirty and there was no hand soap to use This was before takeoff on an 1012 hour international flight. The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful. I have no idea how or why they are even in this industry at all. When my partner politely asked for a glass of water the air hostess rolled her eyes at him let out a huge sigh and pulled a face like it was the most inconvenient thing to be asked. Another hostess had an almost identical reaction when a woman asked for another blanket. The food was reminiscent of the really old bad airline food of yesteryear. Also the food was very few and far between. We went 8 hours without food at one stage. I asked for a snack at this point was told there were no snacks or anything to offer. Before the first trolley run of drinks even reached our row all wine and beer on the plane had ran out. This was less than 1 hour into a 1012 hour international flight. How can they run out of beer wine When I asked this the hostess held up 1 single bottle of red wine said its gone and then kept pushing the trolley by us. We were shocked. The earphones provided allow zero sound to come through from the movie so we didnt end up watching anything at all because it was impossible to hear any sound. The airport staff at customs were extremely rude and unhelpful also. When I tried to ask questions I was ignored. My partner had to get angry and insistent before anyone would Listen or assist us. I had one female customs staff member scowl at me the entire time I stood in front of her. The other 2 females on the customs gate sat on their mobile phones whist the info was loading on their computers and then again between passengers. I strongly advise Westerners not to bother with this company and just pay the extra for an airline that will be respectful of all people and cultures and also one that adheres to general hygiene standards and customer service standards.
Tokyo Haneda to Okinawa. High density on a B777 domestic flight but its quite comfortable plenty of leg room. No announcements in English from the cockpit and this was a flight to Okinawa with a lot of non Japanese speakers. Cabin staff was amazingly not particularly nice. They delivered children toys at the end of the flight. On a 2 hours flight itd be nice to have any food even a pack of crackers. Drinks were only offered once.
San Francisco curb side luggage check in unorganized incompetent and rude. Overall customer service was poor and unresponsive Second and Third Order Impacts Cancellation of family plans scheduled for 03JUL23. Had to purchase undergarments and clothing. Recommend not using United Airlines curbside luggage check in service in San Francisco. Checked in Luggage did not arrive on flight to Arizona. Spoke to United Airlines representative at Phoenix Sky Harbor and they stated luggage would be delivered later that evening to uncles home 02JUL23. After numerous phone calls and messaging finally received luggage at 0630 on 04JUL23. Gentlemen who brought it did not require a signature or conduct inspection of items to insure all items were present. Items inside luggage were rearranged and shuffled. Complete customer service failure by United Airlines and San Francisco curbside luggage check in.
AdamAntalya and return. One negative comment the very narrow seats specially with a 15 year old child on your lap no knee space at all and Im just 180 cm. My husband had to put his legs behind his neck in order to sit. We fly regularly but never in such narrow seats. The 4 hour flight time becomes very long because of this. Extra leg space at the emergency exits costs 15 p.p. extra but not available when you travel with children. Checkin was quick both times. Service is excellent very friendly staff. No snacksdrinks included. The plane wasnt the youngest but except the dirty toilets it was acceptable. If youre not that tall and dont intent to use the toilets or on board services I can recommend this airline.
Ground service at EWR was mediocre as expected. That was probably more about the airport than the airline. However the new United Club was nice. It was spacious with many food choices by American carriers standard. The flight departed on time and arrived early. The 78710 was the highlight. I purposely booked this flight because of it and it was perhaps the best domestic transcontinental equipment available today. Service was fine not over the top but was enough. Inflight meals were quite a step up from my previous UA flights.
Flew Madrid Sofia on an Embraer 190 and Sofia Madrid on an Airbus A319. Excellent value for money. Both flights were on time and landed before scheduled time of arrival. Free piece of checked baggage and nice services inflight sandwich chocolate water and two rounds of free drinks coke coffee milk tea beer wine. It would be nice to have some entertainment on board but it is a minor problem. Will repeat if I come back to Bulgaria.
We had a wonderful crew especially Singapore to Zurich SQ346 17723 with Marissa Celeste Joanne and Scarlet who looked after us wonderfully. They attended to all our needs with no fuss. Thankyou.
The reviews prior to booking were a concern due to the reported delayscancellations without notice so I booked an early AM flight from Florence to connect with a midnight international flight from Frankfurt to give time for things to go wrong. The end result was 12 hours in Frankfurt waiting for my connection as the Air Dolomiti flight departed and arrived within 10 minutes of the published schedule. Checkin staff were friendly and efficient and the cabin crew had a relaxed and efficient manner with the passengers. Meal snacks drinks were offered but declined for a short flight. An enjoyable flight with Air Dolomiti
Very nice trip clean plane very comfortable seats. I was offered tea coffee or water as well as a pastry. First flight was boarded by the bus which wasnt problem as weather was good and it went smooth enough the next in the jetbridge. Overall recommend as they were comfortable and smooth flights.
I was in Puerto Rico for a funeral and was notified at 2.40 pm that my 7pm flight was delayed until midnight. I tried to reschedule to a 9pm flight that same evening and had to either wait 15 minutes to chat with someone or 35 minutes for a phone call. I was advised that the 9pm flight was full and told thank you without any further assistance. I had to reschedule surgeries I was supposed to perform the next day as I would arrive home at 4am for work at 8am. I arrived to the airport at 10pm and once I got through security I was advised that the flight was delayed another hour. At this point I had to cancel the entire shift and will be sending an invoice to Jetblue for pay I missed. This airline is complete garbage and should absolute merge with Spirit to complete the partnership of trash airlines. They also charge 300 a seat and do not include a carry on.
I fly frequently and have never written a review before but was so incredibly frustrated with the experience this morning in Calama Chile. I was at the airport an hour forty minutes before departure and sitting next to the gate. Right before departure I heard my name. I went down and they had denied my luggage boarding due to a bottle of insect repellent. In the last month I had flown with the same luggage from Miami Santiago Puerto Montt Ushuaia Buenos Aires Santiago again without issue. They said it was too late to change flights and would put me on the next flight 8 hours later I said I wanted them to switch me to a different airline but they said they couldnt do it. They even suggested I would need to pay a rebooking fee although they later dropped that. Even if we had hustled I could have made the flight and we could just thrown away the repellent which cost a few dollars. But instead the person at the counter ignored me after recognizing my presence and helped other people who werent even flying. I have flown so many times in my life and it was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Absolutely incredible the complete disregard and ignorance to customer service in a customer service based industry.
Our flight departed at 1230 in the evening on June 29 2021. We need to provide a valid PCR test report for 48 hours before boarding. When we arrived at the airport to check in we were told that our test report might not meet New Zealands entry requirements we were very frustrated. Fortunately staff from China Southern Airlines kept inquiring about relevant information for us. Finally with the help of staff we took the flight back to New Zealand on time. Thank you for your quick accurate professional and solving problems for us.
Already flown many times ARNVAA and vv with Blue 1 in Biz Class C and I can only say to be very pleased with the service provided during this 50 mins flight.
London Heathrow to Dallas. The aircraft was old no sign of refurbishment for the last 10 years or so. Seat pocket was full of rubbish from previous flight. The personal screen is tiny and no longer responsive as a touch screen so I had to use the remote control which is fixed on the armrest and non retractable. The choice of IFE is very limited. The food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portion. I saw some passengers request for more food and I was glad to see the crew giving out nicely without attitude. I must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights tofrom JFK. I had an onward connecting flight with American Airlines and I can clearly see the changes between the 2 airlines over the past few years. Whilst AA is improving BA is becoming a national embarrassment. BA remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes to seat selection. The seat selection price tag just makes the total cost higher than other decent airlines. It no longer deserves a 4star rating but edging between 2 or 3 star. Its not even worth redeeming Avios points anymore. These days Id rather spend my Avios on partner airlines.
I recently had the opportunity to travel with Rex Airlines on a trip from Wagga Wagga to Adelaide. Unfortunately my experience was far from satisfactory. Upon checking in at Wagga Wagga Airport I encountered an unexpected hurdle when I was informed that my fragile item could not be carried on board as I had hoped. Despite the item being meticulously packed with layers of bubble wrap and cardboard corners I had to check it in as luggage. The journey began with a delay of 1 12 hours before our flight to Sydney finally took off. After a layover in Sydney we faced another hourlong delay before continuing to our final destination Adelaide. Upon arrival in Adelaide the challenges persisted. No baggage claim carousels were labelled with flight information leaving passengers including myself unsure of where to collect our belongings. Other passengers generously helped each other navigate the situation. Upon retrieving my other bags I discovered that my fragile item was missing. This led to a frantic search and conversations with representatives from three other airlines present at the airport. Although these staff members tried to assist us we still hadnt received any customer service from Rex at this point. Eventually after considerable effort we located our fragile item only to find that the glass had been shattered and the item damaged. Seeking assistance we were directed upstairs since there were no Rex staff in the baggage service area. However the process of finding customer service became a bit confusing and disorganized resulting in us being redirected back downstairs to wait for a staff member. Feeling frustrated we decided to call for assistance using a courtesy phone. A Jetstar representative promptly arrived and collected a form to begin proceedings for the damaged item however it was not their responsibility. Nevertheless they contacted Rex staff on our behalf. Despite these efforts the waiting continued and we again attempted to seek help from checkin customer service only to be directed back downstairs to the baggage claim area. Finally after waiting for what felt like an eternity during our tenhour transit a Rex representative appeared and performed a cursory examination of the damaged item. We were informed that the items fragility meant they held no liability for the damage. During this encounter the Rex customer service officer made a passing remark about checking or inquiring about the incident before speaking to us which led us to believe crucial information may have been withheld to avoid liability. In conclusion the customer service provided by Rex Airlines during this journey was deplorable. The lack of clear communication consistent redirection and apparent indifference to our concerns left a lasting negative impression. Due to this unfortunate experience I will not be traveling with Rex Airlines again. If Rex Airlines aims to retain loyal customers and improve their reputation I strongly advise reevaluating their customer service model. Redirecting customers without providing adequate assistance will undoubtedly lead to more dissatisfied passengers and tarnish the airlines image.
Clark to Cebu. At first I was very happy with the price. But then I went to fully pay and the credit card processing fee was a whopping 15 That is insane. Then I get to the airport and they tell me my toothpaste and wires need to be checked They assured me that this was normal. I had to pay a lot extra for a checked bag and then they had a terminal fee again overall so many hidden fees that made me furious. Just give me the right price not some made up price and in nowhere in the world is it ok to charge someone 15 on a credit card.
They cancelled my initial connecting flight to JFK from DOH and insulted me more than assisted me. The representatives were very dismissive and one man even told me it was foolish to have boarded the flight in Nairobi to DOH despite being told there that this was the best course of action. I asked about my ticketing options and after a very long wait I was ticketed for a flight to Amman where I would catch my transfer to JFK. I just had to wait for 5 hours which I did. I asked for a meal voucher and was given the minimum voucher. I was able to eat a burger at Burger King and that cashier Apple was the nicest person to me of this whole experience. I went to the gate and my flight to Amman was delayed meaning that I would miss my connection to NY. I went to the gate representative and asked for assistance. A manager came to meet me and said he would help me get the flight to JFK. He said the flight was fully booked but I would be on it. I was then brought to the quiet room and assured that they would come for me once I was ticketed. I slept for 2 hours and went back to the desk asking for an update. They said the flight to JFK was delayed and they would need to find another alternative. I asked if I will be upgraded for my trouble but this was not possible.
I have flown for over 50 years and have been to more than 60 countries this is the worst airline I have ever flown on. The gate attendant asked us to give up our seats window aisle and aisle seats for a family wanting to sit together and if we did they would upgrade us. To our surprise our new seats were in the middle of the middle row at the back of the plane. The inflight entertainment computer left me with little foot room while blowing hot air on my feet. The IFE for everyone on the flight was out of order. All food and beverages other than coffee or tea was room temp. Only one alcoholic beverage wine only for the flight was allowed this was served with your dinner. No ice for drinks. I tried to move to one of the last two rows 18 seats that were empty but I was not allowed due to fact that 4 flight attendants were sleeping. The flight attendants locked the bathroom by the galley for their own use. The other bathrooms ran out of toilet paper and degraded into something worse than a porta john after an outdoor concert on a 100 degree day. After some time a flight attendant brought 2 rolls of TP for 6 bathrooms and gave the rolls to the last person in line. The flight attendants somehow could not understand English if you asked a question but they could speak English if they demanded something from you.
The plane had a foul odor throughout the flight. The plane sat on the tarmac for nearly an hour before going anywhere. The food was hardly edible though not necessary for the short 2 hour flight. Lukewarm beer was served free of charge. The plane itself was old and in need of retirement. The seats were about as cramped together as any I have seen.
Atlanta to Istanbul A350 plane seems new nice and clean. Food was good cabin crew was friendly. Istanbul to Bangkok 330 plane seems aged and old food and crew was good. Overall experience with flight was great. Ground crew not so much.
A quick one day domestic return flight from Damascus to Aleppo and back. Both flights on A320 were on time. The first aircraft was nice but the other had a rundown cabin that really required maintenance. No assigned seating on the return flight. Drinks and cakes were distributed fair enough for such short flights. Checkin and ground service improving compared to the extreme chaos I saw when I flew with them in 2003.
I never fly with them before so the only reason I was book with was the open tickets of going back to London. The worst experience in my life. The flight was 910pm and it was cancelled at midnight they put on the screen that it is cancelled. No communication no customer service no offers food and drink from 11042019 at 910pm till the next yesterday we on the new flight on 12042019 at 9am. Staff cant speak English shouting at Customers. The connection flight from Shenzhen airport you will need to go out and back in to get your connection flight. So if you buy stuff in dutyfree And put in your luggage and you go over 3kg it cost you 52 for 3 kg even them cancel your flight. I will never fly again with Shenzhen airlines.
I arrived at Heathrow after travelling for over 20 hours flying from Perth Australia to London. I had booked my British Airways flight online and as I had not been to Heathrow before gave myself plenty of time to get through Customs and from Terminal 3 to Terminal 5. Total cost for return flights was 240.89Aus 113.68 pounds. I had booked the 8.05pm Heathrow flight to Belfast City Airport but had got through Customer and to Terminal 5 just after 5pm. I went the to BA information desk to see if I could get an earlier flight. I was told yes there was a flight leaving in about 30 minutes and if I paid for the change of outgoing flight it would not be a problem. I was told I would have to pay 110.00 pounds 232.99 Aus so I could get the earlier flight. Because I had been travelling for so long and just wanted to get to Belfast I paid the money. A flight that would normally cost approximately 80 pounds one way cost me 157.00 pounds one way. I will never travel with British Airways again and would never recommend them. A total rip off for just over a 1hour flight.
I had a flight to Jakarta that arrived at the airport at 12am so I intended to wait until my 640am departure flight at the airport. When I arrived at the terminal I wasnt allowed to enter yet to check my bag so I spent the night outside the terminal. The update beside my flight never said gate open or now boarding as some of the others did so finally at 600am I went into the terminal where I was told my flight was not going to the city Malang I had paid for because their airport was closed so Id be taken to Surubaya instead. Because there was no update outside I didnt even have time to ask questions as the check in clerk took my bag and told me to run because boarding had already started. I just made my flight ironic since Id been at the airport for almost 6 hours at this point. Once onboard there was no mention of the new destination or what was going to be done for passengers. As I deplaned I asked the stewardesses who told me I simply needed to find my way to Malang myself. I paid for a flight to a city you gave me no warning that I would not arrive there and then you tell me too bad figure it out After I collected my bag which had tags to Malang by the way I found the Sriwijaya office and asked the man working there what the airline was going to do for me. His limited English made it a problem to communicate but essentially he said the same thing as the stewardesses. When I approached him again to ask if he could at least tell me how to get to Malang he couldnt help me. Thank goodness for another traveller that was in the same boat as me he took me under his wing and helped me get on a shuttle to the bus terminal one hour then through the madness at the terminal and onto the bus for Malang 2.5 hrs and then to a taxi to my hotel 20 mins. Meaning that not only did I receive no notification that my flight had been changed no assistance in reaching my actual destination but it added almost 4 hours to my already 20 hour long commute from the Philippines.
Both flights were on time. The seats were in a 222 configuration with no direct aisle access of window seats. Plenty of legroom but no privacy due to the rather old seating. Sufficient entertainment system with good amount of movies and music. No wifi at all on both flights because of the aircraft type B7878 Crew was helpful and courteous at all times. Food was average probably because of the pandemic it was more like premium economy. All in all i can say I had enjoyable flights with Ethiopian.
I just dont get how much the quality of service differs. I flew out to Lisbon on Tuesday and back today. I booked the Aer space seat and was really impressed with the quality of the lovely cabin crew on my flight to Lisbon. They offered me drinks and a snack. Today however was a different story and on my return leg in the same Aer space seat was good except a crew person who was not shall we say as lovely as the former crew. Said person didnt even offer me the snack and only when I asked if I could have it they said it wasnt much So not impressed
There are only 2 airlines flying within South Africa that have Business Class BA on old B737s and South African Airways on multiple types of aircrafts. Between Cape Town and Johannesburg I always choose SA because a lot of flights are on wide body jets. On this trip I was lucky to get a brand new A330 with the new lieflat business configuration. It cannot get better on a domestic flight full bar 3 course meal and very private seating. The crew provided a great service and were very proud of the new aircraft.
Business class counter occupied by many economy class passengers. Wheel Chair was supplied but the attendant disappeared. Voucher for Lounge simply covers a drink and single piece of food or biscuits or cakes. Aircraft looks very old. Entertainment system was not functioning. Meal was very bad. Among several juices suggested by hostess I opted for the Mango. I got something which I was told it was cocktail and its the only juice available. I asked for Pepsi diet or Cola zero but not available. Toilet is small. Luggage took long time to arrive though it was clearly labeled as Business class and priority labels. Other airlines on the same route offer much better services.
The ultimate trip from hell courtesy of Vietnam Airlines. I will NEVER fly or recommend them again. Why Due to operational reasons my flight from SYD arrived 3 hours late and I would likely miss my connecting flight. VA informed me of this and asked me to email them. I did and suggested an easy alternative depart SYD 2 days later instead of adding a 24h layover in Hanoi. They finally responded by email and didnt give me what I wanted. Instead they intentionally added 24h layover. At Sydney airport staff were not able to change this not able to check my luggage through not willing to upgrade me not prepared to provide any information about what I would do in HAN for 24h or where I would be staying. Upon arrival in HAN me and 7 other premium economy economy passengers were made to wait for 2 hours before we were escorted to the WORST AND OLDEST hotel ever Hotel Victory in Hanoi. Thats when the worst thing happened We did not get individual rooms but were told to SHARE A ROOM WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER. Customer service is absolutely atrocious the IFE sucks with no decent content everything else about this airline is very average. But basically If things go wrong youre absolutely on your own. NEVER EVER choose Vietnam Airlines
Milan Malpensa to London Heathrow with British Airways. 1.25 hrs standing in queue to check in due to new system installed last month running slow. So why no extra staff to cope with this Plane then cancelled 30 mins after time due to technical issue. No systems in place to cope with the size of what then needed to be done. Everyone had to reclaim baggage exit via passport control and queue at service desk to rebook. Unbelievably desk staffed by only one person. People with onward connections were being given priority so their journey could be replanned but each of these took 10 to 15 mins to process with a line of 100 people waiting behind. Thus by the time one person had been served another had been prioritised to front of queue meaning that the queue was effectively not moving. Over 3 hours later a third of the queue was still standing in line waiting to be processed. It was only the selfdiscipline of those in the queue that prevented this descending into total chaos. Why not two terminals so the onward travellers could be dealt with separately from those with simple needs Why no seating and no queue management system Pathetic response to what must be a an occasional problem. Then had to represent to recheckin again via their slow new system and go again through security mercifully top class and passport control for evening flight. Those whod queued longest stayed in hotel to travel next day. No meal vouchers offered. No compensation details offered tho given when asked for.
Heartless soulless staff and company. I am disgusted and appalled at what is the worst travel experience of my entire life with this airline. This is the first time I have flown with FlyDubai and rest assured it will be my last. One hour into my flight I became very feverish and experienced symptoms that correlated with gastroenteritis. I became visibly shaky and the passengers directly adjacent to me became concerned with my wellbeing and I moved to an empty extra legroom seat which I subsequently paid for. I asked for a blanket which was refused by the air hostess supervisor who explained that the blankets were reserved for business class passengers only. She made extremely mocking gestures to me as I continued to shake and I explained that the AC was extremely low and if I kept shaking I will throw up. I have never seen anyone with as much disregard for the duty of passenger care as her. The remainder of the passengers next to me were shocked at how nonchalant she was about the situation. When I threw up in the isle she took little notice and instructed the other flight attendants to clean it up. It was only after seeing me continue to shake that she then brought a blanket and made several extremely condescending and rude comments now you will be happy yeah as I sat visibly shaking. I wrapped myself in the blanket and she woke me several times to ask me why I wasnt sitting in the correct seat and I told her I would pay but I was clearly unwell and thats why I decided to move. She had such little care for how I was feeling and disregarded the sanctity of the human condition in front of her. Just because I didnt book business class does not mean I am to be treated subhuman and woken several times when I am trying to sleep through the fever. I paid for the seat and requested paracetamol several times and my request was ignored several times. This airline had a duty of care towards a really sick passenger and I was treated with contempt and indifference. My complaint to FlyDubai was summarily dismissed and no compensatory effort attempted.
Our trip was fine. XL got us to Paris and back earlier this month with no drama. The flight was very smooth and our party of six easily saved 3000 over what the major carriers charge on this route. The cabin crew gets high praise for their professionalism and courtesy. We would definitely fly XL again.
Check in smooth ontime boarding. Got front row seat from Surabaya to Singapore and last row from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Seat quite comfortable. cabin crew look tired but try to give best response. Standard flight for low cost flight but food price in cabin too expensive. Smooth take off and landing.
Los Angeles to Paris. We decided to try them for our 13 years old and bought a UM Unaccompanied Minor ticket. Worst experience ever. They do not inform you that they need both parent to fill a release form in order for your kid to travel but they then ask you for it when checking in and refuse to check you in unless you have that form which should have been provided by them for you to fill in in the first place. They do not guarantee that your kid will not be seating next to an adult which is a requirement for UM. They do not provide the parent with a gate pass to safely see his kid get inside the plane. Supposedly against their policy. You get no update from them until your kid lands and himself provide you with updates. So to all parents do not use this airline for your kids.
LondonFlorence Return. Outward bound was satisfactory. Return flight was cancelled once we were at the airport and placed on a flight from Bologna. Waited in line for 1.5 hours to check in then put on a bus and undertook baggage drop and security at Bologna. Just be aware that your flight may not leave from the city you booked for.
Santa Cruz to La Paz. I forgot my Bose headphones in the plane and contacted the airline already 4 times via their customer services e mail address I didnt get any response I am very angry and will never use this airline I know that it was my fault but not getting any response isnt a good service in 2017.
Gatwick to Bridgetown. I managed to locate some seats that offered reasonable leg room I am over 6ft although after feeling the knees of the passenger sitting behind me I think he was not so lucky We had a delay in take off but apologies provided. Food was okay and I was pleasantly surprised. Crew members were hard working polite and professional. The Boeing 777200was showing signs of age GVIIW but compared to the other aircraft we flew on last year this plane appeared more cared for. I am concerned how BA are going to shoehorn 10 abreast instead of the current 9. I cannot conceive how physically eating a meal would be possible. Overall the experience was good on this occasion. The IFE was old but worked it did not last time.
Did check in at the biz counter in Madinah airport and was served by a rude gentleman. Finally he told me he need a health declaration which was required by Singapore government. After I have completed the online declaration i start again the check in. This time he asked for the booking ticket for my onwards flight KUL SIN which was operated by MAS. I told him many times that it was reflected on the ticket which i have printed out. The flight details is clearly shown on the printed hard copy ticket. He told me that MAS luggage allowance is 16 kg per pcs. I told him its ridiculous and ask him to show me where he read about the luggage allowance. When i read it is actually referring to carbon emission details and nothing about the luggage allowance. I told him that the info he read is nothing to do with luggage allowance. He then issue the boarding pass after a long unnecessary disruption he made on the service experience he had caused which I clearly unnecessary in the first place. I paid a high price for a fast and efficient service Business Class ticket but instead I have a really bad experience.
Manchester to New York via Heathrow. We were bumped off a BA connecting flight from Manchester to London Heathrow and put on an American Airlines B777300 via LHR. Whilst I would agree that the staff on AA see passengers as a necessary evil particularly as we were the lowest of the low in standard economy the amount of room in their seat is by far a better option than those on the aging BA B747 aircraft. The food drink served on the AA flight was also better than that served with BA. At least the coffee on AA came in coffee shop style cups not the feeble paper cups that BA provided with its 2 sips and its gone drinks. Im going to be booking a trip for our anniversary early next year to Boston which I think Ill book with Icelandair as this would avoid the 20 mins taxiing to the runway and 20 minutes circling time that.
Bangkok Don Muang to Chiang Mai flight booking for 940 instead they changed my flight to 1020 and from CNX to DMK from 1545 again they changed to 1645. These are not the first time. Because last year I bought 5 flights for this year with them and so far the last 2 flights that I flew with them have not been on time as well. Being a budget airline does not mean you can ignore being on time.
Vienna to Stuttgart. I fly regularly with Laudamotion about two times a month. I never had any problems either with the ground staff nor the air hostesses. You have to be sure about their bag policies otherwise you have to pay high charges. I never had any problems. The Online checkin via the Laudamotion app always works well. You have to be sure that youre going to be charged for anything extra than the personal item and the seat but if you dont need a lot its a really good and cheap option especially if you book in advance. The staff are really friendly. In my opinion its equal to other low cost airlines like Eurowings.
LHRHannover Germany. You really wonder sometimes with BA. I paid 940 return and what a joke. Last year I flew Stuttgart and Berlin in Club for about600 and was very happy. Firstly the flight ran from T1 at LHR. T5 Club lounge is rather good. On first sight the T1 lounge looked OK. I arrived at 15.03 and was told hot food was not available after 3pm. With a bit of grovelling I managed to get a plate of Singapore Chicken curry from the waitress. The whole food area consisted of a few miserable sandwichs peanuts and a miserable looking soup. Drinks ok. Flight was an A319 which left about 40 minutes late. Couldnt be bothered to eat the Prawn salad which actually looked ok. FAs were fine. In summary a real big BA con. Flight was one hour and at 450 per hour it costs more than a 7 hour flight in First to JFK. A miserable experience.
Paris to Chisinau. I have maybe flown 10 times with Air Moldova. I was surprised by the quality of service provided by such a small operator and my trips with them have always been very pleasant. Lately to avoid taxes they decided to switch from Paris Charles De Gaulle to Paris Beauvais airport. At first I was a bit disappointed because it seems to me less easy to fly from Beauvais but after few tries I got to understand that there is no huge difference reaching Beauvais or Charles de Gaulle airports when you live far from Paris. I highly recommend Air Moldova.
They change their flight times constantly and cost the flyer lots of money. Their inability to keep their schedule cost me an additional 200 extra time at the hotel extra time with the rental extra day at the parking lot Plus to make matters worse their inconsiderate blunder made me get home at 4 am I was supposed to be home at 8pm the latest.
Copenhagen to Tel Aviv. Norwegian used to be my favorite airline but I made a mistake in a booking called to change it and was advised to cancel the ticket and claim for a refund. I did that and was told a refund was not possible and a change of booking was also not possible due to the cancellation of the ticket. Numerous approaches to their service department were met with the same robotic response that ignored my comments and used a sorry for any inconvenience template. What a shame and disappointment.
My flight from Belgrade to Vienna was a morning flight. The departure was on time and we also landed on time in Vienna. The plane was clean and the seats were comfortable. For short flight they also give us chocolate. The crew was friendly and the flight was very comfortable. I love to flight with Austrian.
Beijing to Prague. The best airline. Staff was very friendly and polite. Nice safety video. Beverages before takeoff. Food was very tasty. Legroom is big you can transform your seat into bed. Plane wasnt very old just 6 years old
My journey with Qatar was an adventure. I was flying out with my dog a native Sri Lankan dog breed was mixedmongrel and it was a nightmare to book. To be fair it wasnt bad the first time mixed breed was okay. Unfortunately I had to change the date of my flight and rebook my dog onto the flight and thats where the nightmare began. The staff wanted to know what breed my dog was despite my dog not having a breed at all. I called them on a Friday about the dog they said I would hear from them within 48 hours. That following Wednesday I had to call them because I hadnt heard anything yet only to find out they never processed the dog in the first place and my flight was that Sunday Despite not having any problems with mixed breed the first time I had loads of problems now. Mixed breed wasnt okay despite stating it definitely wasnt one of the dogs not allowed to fly. Mongrel wasnt okay either. I eventually got approved just over a day before the flight. It was an absolute nightmare to deal with but from others I heard that Qatar was one of the easiest airlines to deal with for pet transport and no one had any problems so far there have been hundreds of Sri Lankan dogs transported with Qatar before this problem. The flight itself wasnt bad. We departed Colombo on time staff were great during check in and checking my and my dogs documents was really easy the manager was even excited to see my dog and her and another staff member dedicated their time to me in my own queue. The staff on the plane were nice too both from ColomboDoha and DohaAmsterdam and assured me my dog was okay even checking with the pilot to make sure the dog was on the flight and the pilot was aware of the dog. The flight itself was comfortable good movie selections too. The only thing that bothered me was a lack of legroom on my DohaAmsterdam flight because the row in front of us had 4 seats and our row had 3 seats leaving less space for me because of the seat in front of me. Me and the dog arrived safely and they even changed the dogs bedding during the layover so Im happy about that. If it wasnt for the nightmare of booking my dog onto the flight it wouldve been great.
JFKGIG. B767300. Flat beds. One of the worst Business Class flight of my life on all aspects. 1 Checkin slow because some passengers from Economy with friends TAM employees were driven directly to Business class counter. 2 Departure was delayed 70 mins. 3nCabin attendants did not stop gossiping in the galley all night long. 4 We had to take our pillows and blankets from the luggage bins. 5 No printed menu. 6 Food was cold ugly and just impossible to consume. 7 Any request was treated with an ugly face as if to say why are you bothering me.
Last year I had a pathetic experience with Flydubai they cancelled the flight at the very last moment without any reason. I was travelling to Dubai from CCU. It got cancelled no refund only voucher we have to book Emirates with a much higher price. This business model must change. This time it got delayed on both journeys for 12 hours without any proper clarifications. Upon asked they will provide standard answer of technical issues blah blah. It is worst experience with this airline.
Booked ticket from Toronto to Montreal directly from their website with my personal mail ID and contact details. They cancelled the flight at the last minute they said flight cancelled gave another one for next day. At least they should inform one day prior or have to arrange another flight or airline at the same time. This is not for the first time. Even though I am aware about their pathetic service I choose this one only because there was no alternate option. They do not value the customers time they behave like its their right to cancel any flight at any time. Also they havent provided me food and accommodation. Its around 8 hours my luggage is not returned waiting at the airport. Very very bad service Porter Airlines not at all recommended to any one.
On the day 12th of January 2022 we had a flight from Amsterdam to Reykjavik at 1645 Flight HV 6887. This flight was canceled due the weather conditions in Iceland. In order to enter Iceland we had to do an antigen test prior 72h the entry to the country. Our country of origin was Spain where we paid 40 for two antigen tests then we spent two days in Amsterdam and everything was planned in order to have the test still valid to travel to Iceland. Obviously we never took into consideration that our flight was going to be canceled and since that happened we asked to a lady at Transavias counter if we had to repeat the test and her answer was no your test will still be valid. The next day when we managed to get to Schiphol Airport we went again to ask at the Transavias counter to make sure if we had to do the test and this time the answer was yes otherwise you might not be able to enter in Iceland. So we repeated the test which cost us 116. I emailed them that the fact that we had to repeat the test wasnt our fault and if there was any chance to get a refund and I didnt get an answer in more than two months the first email I sent was on the 13th of January then again on the 21st of January no answer from them and again out the 15th of March when Ive been told that they couldnt do anything because the flight was canceled due the weather conditions. What upsets me the most is the fact that two of their operators gave me two different answers Ive never got any apologies from them about this whole situation and they took more than two months to give me an answer. The final answer Ive got was after five days that Ive sent them the second reminder. They dont seem to care much about their customers and it seems that theyre not really trained to deal with a situation like the one I had this shows their lack of professionalism and its the reason why I will never travel with them again.
Riga to Dusseldorf. Got charged 60 extra because my backpack was a bit too heavy for hand luggage So I had to check it in as a normal bag it costs 60 no debate I will try to prevent flying with airBaltic in the future Better use Ryanair or Wizz Air they dont try to charge you 60 extra for backpack that is a bit too heavy
Before traveling I was a little concerned that La Compagnie had had a number of delays and cancellations when they first operated this service but decided to risk it. Our flight was on time in both directions. Check in at Luton and Newark took less than a minute each time. They lounges at both ends were decent and comfortable. I am fortunate enough to fly BA Club Class and Virgin Upper class regularly lets not get confused that La Compagnie is comparable to Upper class but its not far away from BA Club. The plane was spotlessly clean cabin crew were pleasant helpful friendly and efficient. The food was certainly as good as BA Club possibly better. The quality of wines and champagne was good although there wasnt a choice. The seats are very roomy and comfortable but they dont go flat to 180 degrees however we knew that and actually did have some sleep on the way back. I assume the cost to upgrade the plane when it was refurbished by La Compagnie to have full flat beds was just too expensive. We paid 1500 for two persons returns which is a phenomenal bargain and would happily have paid more. There were about 40 passengers on both trips. We found the films loaded on the Samsung Galaxy tablets more than acceptable and the viewing experience as good as any business class. All in all La Compagnie way exceeded our expectations and I would thoroughly recommend them. Will they thrive and survive is the big question and time will tell.
FRAVIEFRA on CRJ200. Cheapest option when compared to Lufthansa and Austrian plying this short 1.5 hour flight. Small plane meant a long bus ride to remote stand position. Larger carryon bags had to be deposited in a trolley parked next to the plane. Aircraft spotless but leather seats showing their age quite saggy in the squab. Service consisted of a choice of crusty cheese or ham roll followed by drinks tea coffee. FAs smiling. The return was similarly uneventful but again a long bus ride at FRA. Luggage claim was quick.
Very disappointing flight with Emirates. Started at the airport with unfriendly Check In staff. We travelled as a couple and had together 85 kg luggage. 5kg overloaded. 80kg were permitted. With no discussion I had to remove stuff to my hand luggage. Up in the air when it was the dessert service I was full so I asked for just some cheese and fruit. The FA said no you can only can choose one Cheese or fruits Are you kidding me This is the first time that this has happened to me. Ive been a frequent business and first class traveller for almost 20 years and have had mostly the opposite experience. In business class even when you are still hungry you can have more fooddesserts whenever you want. After that I went to the Sky bar which is a nice feature of EK A380 and saw many fruits and more snacks. Very illogical. The FA who denied me my fruit I saw her mostly in back galley eating and chit chatting. Its the first time I have travelled with Emirates and maybe the last time.
Originally my flight from Bali to Jakarta was at 1150am. Got an email saying they have changed the time to 110pm. My connecting flight to Singapore is at 415pm cool still have time. Arrived at the airport around 10am. Flight has been delayed to 220pm. Still have time to catch my connecting flight. Didnt board until 250. Its currently 335pm and still waiting to board everyone now. I dont think Ill make it to my connecting flight. Worst airline I have flown with.
New Delhi to Tokyo by ANA. Being Vegetarian I was little apprehensive of vegetarian food the airline may supply. To my surprise it was one of the best Indian Asian Vegetarian food I had. I have been traveling a lot most in economy class and had a chance to taste varied vegetarian foods in sky but this one was simply delicious. Adding to the joy of traveling was small small courtesies shown by staff during the flight they were polite and normally such behaviour is vanishing slowly and gradually from the Economy airlines culture. The seats were really comfortable and all the items provide wire a brand new look. The leg space was better equivalent to any top Airlines will provide. I wish that this Airlines will keep this culture in these competitive times. I would have given an extra star had there been an option of giving. Five stars and above.
Seoul to Istanbul via Almaty. I was uneasy throughout the flight. Passengers have been on board for over an hour and have not left. In the meantime the announcement came 40 minutes later. The childrens food came out as baby food. I asked stewardess the adult meals because child could not eat but she declined firmly.
This is the worst airline ever Starting with a website that is sooo Not user friendly. To the extremely rude and unprofessional staff on the phone and in the airport. Nothing like waiting to check in and only 2 people working the counter while 6 people stand around talking to one anothers door theres about 60 people on line. Lazy doesnt even cover how these people acted The food on the plane was awful You could only have water to drink the food was served prison style. No one smiled or even pretended to be happy you felt like they were doing you a favor just being there. They picked up the trays of uneaten food and that was the last you saw of these miserable people. I did ask why they werent serving and soft drinks I was told it was due to COVID restrictions which I found out was false. The inflight entertainment was a joke 9 hours of flying with movies from 1990. Never again will I fly Alitalia.
PAL is a major let down what a real shame to the flag carrier. If you need to connect flights make sure that you book a flexible or refundable ticket because PAL is never on time. Our flight from Manila to Tagbilaran was delayed by 2 hours and the same on the return sector. We have connecting international flights which are in a different terminal so surely well be missing them considering the traffic in Manila no matter youre only going to the terminal next door. Take a good look at your operations when you cancelreschedule a flight there are tons of inconveniences to us customers ie. Car rental extensions pick up schedule changes time management of people that are dropping us off hotel checkout time plus missing our connecting flights more importantly. Flying with PAL is like playing the Russian Roulette.
I received an email 1 hour before the flight that the flight was canceled due to maintenance issues. They returned all the bags to us and didnt do anything for us. They said it was canceled due to weather issues although the email said something else. They didnt provide any voucher for a taxi or hotel. My flight got postponed for 24 hours.
We do not have a choice but to fly with Thomson Airways as the hotel we go to is a First choice and you can book direct through Thomson. The cabin floor of our aircraft was dirty the back of the seats were covered in splatter marks I assume food the metalwork of the seats armrest etc had a thick coating of dust. The seats are so uncomfortable and narrow also the leg room is poor. For a 5 hour 30 min flight there is no entertainment yet 6 hours is classed as long haul and you get the entertainment. The food on the inbound flight was almost gone as was the duty free. All the other UK airlines seem to use these small type aircraft for this destination. Thomson look at your reviews and give the paying customers a decent flight.
I was unable to check in online and had to spend over 2 hours on a chat with a flair rep to try to resolve the problem which was never resolved. The flight was supposed to take off at 235 pm however before i left for the airport I checked the flair website which said the flight was on time and i checked flightaware which showed that the flight was not leaving until 437 in the afternoon. My wife and i arrived at the airport and checked in with a very nice friendly and courteous young lady. During the checkin process i was asked to out each of my suitcases on the scale and then take them back because the luggage had to be brought by us to a special luggage drop area at the far end of the terminal. All of sudden we hear a man yelling at us to put our suitcases on the scale. The agent explained that we had already done that but the man who identified himself as the Manager stated that he had not personally seen us put the luggage on the scale. I asked the man his name and position but he refused to allow me to see his ID. I asked the agent if the plane was going to be on time and she double checked all of her sources and she assured me the plane was on time. After over an hour waiting in the customs line it was already 155pm so we were able to board the plane immediately. before i boarded i asked the gate agent if the plane was on time. She insisted the plane was leaving on time. I check the flair website and it still said on time and the flightaware website still said the plane was not leaving for another 2 hours and 37 minutes. The plane left the gate just a few minutes late but then sat on the taxiway over 2 hours before takeoff. When we landed after 7PM I received a text message from Flair that was sent at 411 PM stating that there would be a delay in the flight. I was quite disappointed in the plane itself as on our first flight from FLL to YYZ there was a lot of advertising about the wifi and entertainment system. Unfortunately on the first flight the wifi and entertainment system was broken but in this return flight there was no system at all. Once on the plane my wife was in the window seat of an exit row. There was a man directly opposite my wife at the window seat. It seems that the behavior of my wife and this man were very similar but the flight attendant kept coming over to my wife to correct her behavior but ignored the man who was doing the exact same thing. My wifes crime was using the tray table during the 2 hour period we sat on the plane before it took off and for not wearing her sweater properly storing it around her waist.
Our experience on Sunwing Airlines TorontoIxtapaToronto was a microcosm of many of the other disparaging reviews on this site baitandswitch marketing leading to itinerary changes that turned what was supposed to be a 5hour return leg into an 8.5hour endurance test sudden mechanical issues resulting in planechanges on both legs after boarding appallingly crowded checkin conditions in Ixtapa that required passengers to line up outside in the boiling sun decrepit horribly uncomfortable cabins food shortages furious passengers whose luggage had been lost the list goes on. Sunwing is just plain bad. It makes Aeroflot of the 1980s look exemplary. Spend a few hundred more and save yourself tons of aggravation. As one irate fellow passenger put it The first time its Sunwings mistake. The second time its mine.
Luang Prabang to Chiang Mai. First flew with them as Lao Aviation many years ago that was a risky business but today Lao Airlines is as different as chalk and cheese Everything about them is different the aircraft are modern and well maintained with clean interiors staff are friendly and courteous ontime performance is goo all in all a great little airline. Flew e sectors an Airbus LPQVTELPQ and an ATR72 to Chiangmai as good as any other international airline. The catering is not as good as it could be but as most sectors are less than an hour it is understandable.
Tulear to Antananarivo. Quick Checkin on time plane a bit old refreshments and a snack served friendly flight attendants. The fare was somehow high but this is Madagascar. You shouldnt come here if you are pampered by lowcost carriers
A good return trip to PUJ in the Caribbean with AF from CDG. They have a very solid product. Good quality food two services and even champagne in economy which is a great classy touch. Cabin crew were immaculately presented on both legs and friendly and highly professional. Additional drinks on demand. IFE is not to my taste but I am not a big user of IFE. If there was any fault it would be the numerous announcements in English French and Spanish which was a bit much. Also lights a bit bright at other times. Baggage handling and check in fine on both legs. A good solid product from a classic legacy carrier.
First and last experience with Turkish Airlines. The problems began at checkin when they refused to check my bag through from AMS over to KLM I flew Delta from AMS to ATL and then home to TPA. No problem I thought I will just go through passport control grab my bag and check in with KLM again. I chose my own seat which was great. I prefer a window seat toward the front of the cabin. So everything was going to be great in 9A flying on Christmas Day to Amsterdam so it should be quiet and fairly decent for an Economy flight. Upon boarding the gate agent took my boarding pass and reassigned me to 38A the literal last row of seating on the plane. I am fuming at this point as the front of Economy cabin is literally empty. Turkish passengers began complaining so much this had also happened to them that the gate agent came onto the plane and said she had to move us to the back to balance the plane .. this is the actual explanation that we got. Utterly absurd. Everyone who tried to move to a different seat during the flight was forced to return to their assigned seat even though the plane was almost empty and several people were forced to go back and sit with people with whom they were not traveling Unreal The cleanliness and hygiene was fine. We got a brown paper bag with a kashar cheese sandwich a cake a box of fruit juice and a small bottle of water. Leg room was appalling but not out of line with most Economy seats. But the fun had only just begun Upon arrival in Amsterdam I went to passport control so I could go to the baggage claim collect my checked bag and checkin with Delta via KLM .. except at passport control I was told that I was not allowed to enter the EU because of COVID restrictions So I walked up to the transfer section went through the security check and then tried to find my gate and someone to help me. Because of THYs refusal to check my bag through to another airline it was removed from the plane slung onto the belt and dumped. Without KLMs help they would have abandoned my checked bag in AMS with no way for me to reclaim it Thankfully a KLM agent was extremely helpful called Swissport with my THY bag claim ticket number and got it loaded onto my Delta flight. Without her I would have lost an expensive suitcase full of expensive winter clothes and all of my souvenirs purchased in Istanbul. Thanks a lot Turkish Airlines You really care about your customers. Never again
I have been loyal British Airways and found little to complain about. The last two long hauls I have done this year with BA has seen the passengers wearing winter coats when flying to the tropics due to the cabin being kept freezing. But my main complaint is the nice little earner BA have come up with where you pay seat allocation and extra for bulkhead or emergency exit seats where there is more leg room. I have now paid the high rate on numerous occasions only to find the plane configuration has changed and I am in a regular seat the crew have been known to ask me for proof Todays flight was no exception I wasnt even given an apology or a refund but told to keep my voice down. The crew looked tired and just going through the motions. My loyalty may have come to an end and I am seriously considering Air Mauritius or Emirates for my next trip.
TAR Aerolineas is a new regional Mexican carrier which operates several routes in Mexico. Flew a domestic route roundtrip and found the service to be topnotch. Aircraft brand new and clean punctual departures and arrivals attentive ground and cabin personnel excellent value for money. Would choose them again when my travel plans take me to Mexico.
EVA air is very competitive for the route from Hong Kong to Taipei. I choose EVA is mainly because I want to experience it. The ground service in Hong Kong and infight service are very great. All in all it deserves a 5 star airline.
Athens to London with British Airways. To call this business class is some sort of mean spirited joke. To start with British Airways lounge is provided by Skyways which as jammed with both people and a bad assortment of food. The actual seat 3D had no power plugs and no TV at the front of the seat what you find in economy in Canada. The seat width was narrow and the pitch was pathetic. Flying premium economy on Cathay Pacific is dramatically superior. The flight from Heathrow to Athens was on a very beat up B767 on Aug 4 2017. The food on this flight was both minuscule and horrid. It is amazing that they can attempt to call this level of service business. Very disappointing.
Antsiranana to Sambava. Flight was booked in Air Madagascar website flight was operated by Air Tsaradia the new domestic carrier. Checkin quite fast not too serious about little overweight luggage and cabin luggage due to the short flighttime no refreshments fare a little bit expensive compared to flighttime alternative would have been to travel 12h on very bad road.
I was flying from TRNMUC last August the overall flight experience was good. I booked the flight through Lufthansa where Air Dolomiti is their carrier operating from Turin. The cabin crew were polite and helpful. The flight was on time but the ground crew delayed it a few minutes with moving passengers from the aircraft to the terminal. I flew thrice in the same month on the same route where my overall satisfaction was good.
1010 the best customer service Ive ever experienced. I had some problems getting my bag from LAX to HANEDA and they did everything they could to located and send it. Thank you
My experience was very horrible. First they cancelled my flight on the morning I was going to fly. They put me on an alternate flight and when I arrived on the airport it was a huge mess. The flight was delayed by almost two hours and for that reason I missed my connecting flight from Paris. I had to wait in Paris airport for six hours which caused me to miss my train from Milan to Rome and I did not get a refund for that booking. The air hostesses on the flights were very rude and unhelpful. When I was returning back from Milan to Paris I had requested assistance which unfortunately did not arrive at all at Paris airport. I was made to wait for a very long time and yet the assistance did not arrive. I had to walk by myself to the other terminal to get the connection and had to walk very fast as my time was wasted waiting for the assistance. When I entered the flight the attendants were very rude and did not help me put the luggage away in spite of requesting it. I was asked to do it by myself as they said that they will not do it at all. Again in London I did not receive any assistance and the flight was delayed by one hour they did not seem to care for any travelers who had connecting flights. No one was informed where are flights connection will be from. I had to run like crazy to catch the flight. I was given the wrong gate number when asked by one of the Air France representative. I barely made it to the flight and then I entered the Virgin Atlantic flight to San Francisco which was operated by Air France. I was told that there are only 10 blankets for the entire flight and I will not be able to avail the facility of the blanket. The headphones were broken and unusable. I will never recommend ever to anyone to use Air France and I will not use it either. I need my money which got wasted on cancellation of train.
Manchester London City. Very impressed. Flight was called for boarding 10 mins before departure and was greeted by 2 very friendly FAs seating fine for a 50 min flight offered pre take off sweets. Once we took off Crew offered Ham or cheese sandwiches complimentary drinks from the bar then tea or coffee finished off with Belgian chocolates. All drinks were served in china mugs and glass tumblers made it feel more like Business class. Arrived on time and as I arrived at the luggage belt my bag was already there within five minutes of Landing I was on my way into London. Excellent service Excellent Crew. No complaints
I wanted to change my one flight time and was advised that i would be charged 2400USD. 2400USD for a change that was more almost double of what it cost me to fly from USA and then to South Africa. I was only requesting a flight time change from Kenya to South Africa. I tried to call customer services a few times and it takes almost an hour for them to answer. After waiting an hour they cut me off. All said i would never recommend this airline to anyone.
Short hop from BWI to PHL as part of a long haul connection from PHLDOHKUL. What a dreadful airline From beginning to end it was such a hassle for a 25 minute flight. At BWI they insisted that you check in at a kiosk to obtain a boarding pass prior to check in. Despite telling them it was an international flight with a transfer connection and one party was on a wheelchair they still insisted. The kiosk rejected my attempts wasting about 20 minutes of my time. At check in the staff were rude and insisted that my bags were over the weight limit despite travelling in on a business class ticket. Finally she relented printed off my boarding pass only to have it rejected by the TSA agent as the bar code was not printed properly. Then there was no one to push the wheelchair for my travelling partner so I took it upon myself to do so as they were closing the flight. I was told off by the check in agent for not arriving earlier but I pointed out that we had been there on time but wasted 20 minutes at the kiosk and another 20 minutes queuing to check in. On the short flight there was no beverage service but that is a small matter. On the whole I will do everything possible to avoid US Air in the future. Ground services were appalling.
Worst customer service Ive ever experienced. I have been trying to reach them for two days waited for more than an hour and they either hang up or never answer. I needed to cancel a flight and get a travel credit which they said I could at the time of the reservation and the only contact they provide is this.
Hanoi to Da Nang. Expect delays Dont expect much else. We were delayed both ways which amounted to a wait time in the airport 3x longer than the actual flight. Delays seem to be the standard with this airline and they seem pretty cavalier about wasting your time. Be prepared and manage your expectationsentertainment accordingly. Its also a bare bones flight with no entertainment or beverage service. Sure its a value option but for what I got I think it should have been half the cost.
Shanghai to Mauritius in August 2019. Our flight from Mauritius to Shanghai was scheduled the day of. They didnt bother to let us know until we were already checked out of our hotel. They did not make any effort to reimburse us for our meals even though we had to stay in Mauritius for an extra day. We had to jump through hoops just to get them to pay for our hotel for an extra night. I would never recommend this airline.
Larnaca to Copenhagen via Riga. Airbaltic has the worst cabin service i have ever experienced. Both when flying to Larnaca from Copenhagen via Riga and home trip there were small delays which meant we literally ran to gate to make the flight. And even though both flights are operated by air Baltic instead of a quick apology and a smile they bark orders at you to hurry and are super unfriendly. Only with airbaltic I have experienced that people are having some difficulty with fitting the cabin luggage into the overhead compartment and the cabin crew are just standing and eyeballing instead of helping. I could go on. But all in all airbaltic is just disastrous airline and to make matters worse airport in Riga has also lots of issues. So are you flying with airbaltic through Riga you are almost guaranteed a disappointment.
My fiance and I chose to fly Hawaiian Airlines for our first trip to Honolulu and had backtoback issues with them. On our initial flight from Seattle to Honolulu they lost our luggage. We were told by baggage claim services that we had to call the number we were given to talk to someone about what to do but that our bags were most likely stuck in Seattle. After being on hold with the number they provided us for over an hour before even speaking to a single representative we gave up with them. They eventually called us way later to inform us that our bags had been at the Honolulu Airport the whole time but had been delivered to the wrong place. We finally got our bags back. On our flight back from Honolulu to Seattle our flight with Hawaiian was so late that we missed our connecting flight. Hawaiian was so unhelpful and refused to cover any costs accommodation or anything. We couldnt afford a hotel and ended up having to sit at the Seattle airport for around 5 12 hours till family members were able to drive all the way to the Seattle airport to get us before we had to drive roughly three hours to our hometown. Such a ridiculously stressful experience on top of which my inflight entertainment screen never worked on EITHER flight we had with them there were zero vegetarian options for the free meal they provide for dinner not everyone eats pork Hawaiian and the stewardesses seemed incredibly inconvenienced by the simplest of requests. Passengers shouldnt be treated this way when they pay a ridiculous amount to be on that flight.
We were supposed to board 51223 at 115 pm and then they gave us an announcement that our flight got delayed and they didnt know for how long the FDA delayed the flight due to high traffic. So youre telling me every time there is a holiday you are going to delay cancel a flight because of high traffic Ridiculous. Not to mention last time I flew with them I was stranded at the airport for 4 hours because they were fixing the brakes of the airplane and I didnt get to my destination till 1 am. This will be my last time flying with Allegiant Air.
Flight on time even landed 30 min ahead of schedule which was great. One thing to improve there was no priority boarding from Reykjavik we are paying for this and basically were boarded last.
Delhi to London via Kuwait. The staff is insensitive to the needs of the passengers. My flight from Delhi to Kuwait got delayed and consequently I missed my Kuwait to London flight. I had already made reservations in London for that day but could not avail them. They booked me on night flight to London which meant that I had to stay in Kuwait for about 78 hours.
I flew from Los Angeles to London with British Airways who seem to be working hard to improve things. What I cannot understand is why they still have not updated their Club World seating after so many years. Even the US carriers offer superior seating these days. I dont get it new British Airways plane but same old seats. While they are fully flat and I slept well the main issues are having to step over other passengers as there is no direct aisle access and a lack of storage space and cubby holes around the seat. The cabin crew were mature professional and the CSD introduced himself during the flight and seemed genuine. Catering seems to have improved I chose the beef for dinner and instead of the usual overcooked lump in a casserole dish it was cooked well and plated similar to what all first rate airlines do in Business class these days. Instead of the dreaded bacon roll for breakfast there were two hot egg dishes a toasted sandwich or a cold plate of meats and cheeses. British Airways Ranking
Toronto to Beirut via Dubai. What is the big fuss about Emirates It was ok nothing more than other airlines actually the seat was not comfortable enough business class had part of the seat pressing against my arm left bruises that turned blue two days ago. That was because the seats are too narrow. Fly another business class and you will see the difference. Wifi was a trouble to connect to. I must say the A380 as a plane is impressive but the way it was designed inside was not the best. On my 2nd leg of the trip we flew the 777300ER and what a terrible seating arrangement. I cant believe how they thought of putting the touch pad where you are supposed to put your hand letting you feeling you are tied during the flight. Very bothersome. Whoever is loyal to Emirates I know they try to accumulate skyward miles but you guys should fly other airlines business class and you should see what you are missing. In addition to the savings in your pocket.
Totally agree with all of the comments below. We travelled from Sharm to Cairo and back again on a day trip booked through Thomas Cook. Cannot believe a company with such a good reputation would use this airline. We are not nervous travellers normally but I was convinced we would not make it back in one piece. My husband described it as a rollercoster on wings. Really bad smell of fuel almost no safety demonstration broken seats the staff were armwresting each other on takeoff not very professional the plane was so old. The scariest experience of our lives.
My wife and I flew from Heathrow to Amsterdam in business class on a free Avios upgrade with British Airways. We made use of the galleries south lounge in terminal 5 which had a good variety of drinks and snacks. Full meal on the 45 minute flight The service was very good but I would not pay the asking price for such a short trip. Great when its almost free.
Old aircraft missing armrests and smelly carpets. I fly very regularly between Greece and Croatia and unfortunately this airline is often the only option without routing half way around Europe. The staff are rude and the food terrible. Once I asked why my baggage was not being marked with priority sticker being a star alliance gold member with several airlines and was surprised when the checkin staff didnt know what Star alliance was. 500EUR round ticket AthensDubrovnik sometimes costing a lot more if booked less than 2 weeks to travel date. Truly disappointing that this airlines is a star alliance member.
Not sure who invented these seats but they are awful. Difficult to get in and out if you are inside. Has not flown British Airways for a number of years but they have not improved in this time food still very mediocre and service the same. You even had to pay in advance to select a seat which we did. However when we checked in we were told sorry crew using the seats you paid for Still waiting for my refund. Inflight entertainment is rubbish movies well past their sell by date. Back to Emirates for us.
I flew with Air France from Paris Charles de Gaulles to Nice Cote dAzur and It was an enjoyable journey. The aircraft was looking new and clean cabin crews were smiley friendly and helpful. Really enjoyed flying with Air France.
First class flight from London to Asuncion via Sao Paulo. Cabin staff very efficient. Good food. On time all the way. Baggage arrived safely. Bathrooms kept clean. Cabin staff continued attending throughout the flight. Flight JJ 8085 London Sao Paulo JJ 8123 Sao Paulo Asuncion. 3rd June. Seats 44 H K. 24 D C.
One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. Of course you can not expect much in a country like Papua New Guinea. Overall I had six domestic flights all were delayed by at least one hour. All planes were in a disappointing condition. The cleanliness was poor the crew were rude incompetent and not very service oriented.
Manila to London via Kuwait. Beyond poor. 9 hours delayed with no prior communication. Not even updated the details online. The flight was delayed as the aircraft had not even set off yet from Manila so they obviously knew the delay was coming. False claims of poor weather from the airline. On prior flights two weeks before were not much better. Poor service on the plane no service in Kuwait airport.
LAXPPT Business Class. Great ambience nice tropical feel as soon as you step on the plane. Normal modern business class seats not the newest 100 recline ones but plenty of leg room and comfort. Food was very good as well. I recommend flying with them.
Absolutely atrocious service from probably the worst airline in the world when it comes to customer service and baggage retrieval They lost our bags in Istanbul during our layover despite them being booked direct through to Dubai. We are now sitting on our honeymoon supposed to exploring and having a romantic time eating out so I can spoil my wife instead we are stuck inside without clothes. You cannot even reach this company to try and locate your bags our information is entered incorrectly on their system and our one bag we cannot even locate through them. Do not trust this company at all. You will be disappointed. I expect this company to compensate me for all the clothes I will have to buy and for the inconvenience.
Our flight from Paris to Toronto was delayed by over 3 hours. No big deal. It happens. Toronto to Portland was another story. Because the connection was tight Air Canada decided to bump us to a Toronto to Vancouver for an overnight then onto Portland. They didnt bother to consult us they just did it without mentioning where we were expected to spend the night or who would pay for it. When we arrived at Toronto our flight to PDX was also delayed. That made it possible to get back onto our original flight but not without scrambling from the gate to customer service then racing back to the gate again. The customer service approved us for boarding our original flight. When we returned to the gate the agent there questioned our permission to board. After grumbling about how the other agent had left him to do his job he finally agreed to give us seats. We boarded went to our assigned seats then were told we couldnt sit there because they were crew seats. The gate guy had given us seats assigned for crew only. We had to dash around to find two seats. A kind passenger agreed to move so that we could sit together. In the fourplus hour flight no blanket no pillow no food unless you paid for it no media no magazines. Only a 2beverage service. The seating was so tight. As expected in the change from one flight to another our bags didnt arrive with us. It was 1030 at night. Not one Air Canada agent either in lost luggage or ticketing was present at PDX. They go home at 9pm we were told. So we were unable to file a missing luggage report. This morning I tried to go online to report our missing bags Air Canada calls them delayed bags not missing. It turns out that unless youve got a file number thats issued at the airport you cannot use the online system you must call a service number. I waited 34 minutes on the phone for an agent. When she answered her accent was so strong that I had to ask her to repeat every question several times. I had to repeat my answers to her questions several times. She asked me for an original booking number that according to her was on my boarding pass. It was not. I checked it repeatedly. When I explained that I could not find it I had my ticket number my name flight numbers baggage tags...etc. she hung up on me. I called again. I waited about 25 minutes on the second call. I politely explained that I could not understand him and ended the call. Air Canada did text us. It looks as if our bags may arrive by tonight.
On December 16th I was supposed to fly from Hamburg to Brussels. There was a strike so at the airport they rerouted me over Munich on a flight not affected by the strike. No problem it happens. My flight to Munich unfortunately left with delay so I missed the connection in Munich. And then it started. Since it was already late the Lufthansa staff in Munich to just organize your own hotel and they would provide a refund after which they just closed the office. Now they refuse to refund the hotel. Avoid this airline at all cost. If you miss your flight they leave you stranded with no assistance at all.
Sydney to Singapore return late Janearly Feb 2015. The economy seats were relatively comfortable but could be a bit softer. The away leg BA16 was quite good except for the meal which was barely edible. The flight back had a much improved meal but the entertainment system had repeated issues and had to be restarted about 4 times. Another problem with the return leg BA15 is that if you get on the plane in Singapore and not in London by the time online checkin is open for you there are almost no seats to choose from. I wanted a window seat and had not a single window to choose from at the moment the online checkin opened for me. Service on both flights was good. I was feeling a bit dehydrated and asked for plenty of water on the return flight and had no problems at all. All the staff was nice and accommodating.
Jakarta to Singapore. This is the most horrible experience ive encountered. They didnt have any sort of organisation or communication skills towards their customers. I was waiting in line at the checkin counter almost for 30 minutes and i have been asking which checkin counter is for my flight and it turns out that it was different. When i got there turns out I missed my flight because nobody was there to help or answer my question. Never use this airline ever again
I flew with numerous airlines but I gotta admit British Airways is by far the worst airline ever when it comes to customer support. I waited 3 weeks for a ticket change. Call center workers are giving you false information just so they would make you hang up. They told me I was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes but never got. They dont have a live chat just like American Airlines do they dont have a online form to submit your questions they don t have a working international number. Total garbage.
Southampton to Guernsey return usually made on FlyBe but we wanted to change having been increasingly unimpressed by FlyBes use of additional charges which make their bargain fares poorer value. Blue Islands price was all inclusive comparable in total costs and offered a really impressive service in the face of adverse weather conditions. We were due to depart early on a fogbound April Friday morning with a ferry connection we had to meet by 4.15pm at the latest. First flight was cancelled due to fog but second noon flight was swiftly re arranged luggage transferred all with minimal fuss and still within the desired time window. We arrived in time to lunch on Guernsey and made our connection wonderful service unlike that of their larger competitor which cancelled a similarly timed early morning flight and were unableunwilling to rescue friends in time to make the same ferry. We had a fabulous weekend on Herm they eventually arrived on Saturday missing half their break. Our return flight left early and arrived early with equally impressive service including the excellent Blue Island lounge at Guernsey. We have already booked our next flight with them and will seek to use Blue Islands whenever possible in future.
Munchen to Singapore. Great A350 aircraft everything very clean extra clean restrooms with some extras Great Entertainment programme good food and real forks wet towels for refreshing while waiting on a meal. Very helpful and professional staff. Cool uniforms big Choice of onboard shopping. The best airline Ive flown.
Sydney to Singapore. I am disappointed with quality of service and staff attitude on my last flight SQ 252 on 10 November. I requested for a non vegetarian Hindu meal and was served Lamb. For some reason I dont understand my meal was served before other passengers and when I asked for another meal I was rudely told that it can only be served once all Passengers are served. I left extremely insulted and did not eat any meal on flight.
Seattle to Incheon. Very good to flight. Boarsing time is accurate and fast. The airline representatives help to the elder person take by wheelchair. It is so nice and awesome. Also the staff are kind.
We flew with Oman Air before the pandemic and the trip was satisfactory. So I had no qualms about booking with them again for my trip to Europe in 2020. Unfortunately this coincided with the covid pandemic and both flights to and from Europe were cancelled. I was hoping for a refund but was only offered a rebooking for 1 year. Obviously did not expect the pandemic to last this long. At the end of 2020 I felt that this had gone on long enough and even though they extended the rebooking for 2 years it was just too hard to make any kind of travel plans. I requested a refund via their website and was met with an email offering rebooking or a travel voucher that could be turned into a refund after 1 year. This is unacceptable to me given the current circumstances and obviously Oman Air is just trying to buy itself time and hoping customers will give up trying to get a refund. For my Europe trip I had two other flights one with Air France refunded immediately and one with Easyjet offered a voucher. The fact that A flag carrier like Oman Air is acting more like a budget airline surely affects its prestige. When the world goes back to normal I suspect I will think twice before taking Oman Air ever again.
We arrived from Tokyo to Miami after having a layover in Canada. We asked at least 9 employees between Tokyo and Canada if we should pick up our luggage and check it back in or if there was anything we had to do in order to not have the luggage forgotten at the layover in Canada. Three of them had no idea what the proper process was and of them told us we did not have to do anything and it would ship directly to Miami. We arrived in Miami and to our surprise our luggage was not there. We then received a text message saying the following Bag is delayed Tag Booking Expected to arrive in Miami MIA May 27 2229 Arrange delivery here flyac.ca we arranged the delivery and again to our surprise the luggage is not getting to Miami until tonight and will not be delivered till 3 days later. We called to see if they would provide us with some funds to be able to purchase the necessary items needed for the time being and were told we would have to purchase them on our own and maybe after we could put a claim in and see if they approve it or not. We asked for a time line of how long the approval usually take and were refused an answer. We asked to speak to a supervisor and were told they do not have any supervisors that could help us and refused to put us trough to a supervisor after which they told us to hang up. When we said we would not hang up until we spoke to a supervisor they put us on hold and hung up. We are now left in a city away from home with no luggage and no resources to get the necessities we need.
I booked a short flight to go to Frankfurt via Bahrain. Big mistake. My flight was forwarded by 6 hours without an option. This doubled my flight time. So I had to hang out for 6 hours in a small airport. The staff at DMM airport was not too friendly. I do not recommend this airline.
Thomas Cook Airlines the worst flight experience Ive ever had. Our flight was behind schedule by 1 hour and 30mins we had to go through customs and when we went to get our luggage to catch our connection flight they already had our bags pulled to the side and told us we werent going to make the connection. So they gave my wife and I a piece of paper that had our names on it our bag info and there was another piece of paper stapled to it that had a hotel name and number to call to get a shuttle. It also said booked even the guy told us that we had a room booked and we just needed to call the shuttle. So we got to the hotel and there wasnt a room booked for us and we had to pay for our own room which was 200. We also had to pay luggage storage at the airport which was almost another 100. I was told by Thomas Cook since our flight wasnt 3 hours or more delayed that they dont need to pay us back. Their baggage fees are crazy and you cant have a carryon of more than 6kg which was crazy because they didnt care when we went to Manchester. My carryon was pretty much empty so we had to pay extra for our other bags being 6lbs over. 200 fee total. Would rather pay extra to have better customer service
London Gatwick to Islamabad via Dubai. My first time on Emirates. I had heard good things about this airline in the past so decided to give it a go. Baggage dropoff at Gatwick was fine. The gate at Gatwick was horrible a small space to accommodate all economy class passenger of an A380. Most of us had to stand for a long time before boarding commenced as the seating at the gate were totally inadequate. My seat on the A380 was comfortable but the IFE did not work. The seat would not recline either. The stewardess tried to help but ended up apologizing for the broken IFE and seat. The meal service was good and the quality of food reasonable however the portion sizes were very small. The flight from Dubai to Islamabad was not good at all. Boarding at Dubai was chaotic Most passengers were not allowed to take their hand luggage on board with them as according the staff at the gate the flight was full and there would not be enough space on the plane for hand luggage despite the fact that most people had just one item of hand luggage with them. The boarding process took a long time and the gate staff didnt seem too bothered. The seats on Boeing 777300ER were extremely uncomfortable the legroom was very tight and the seat width was also very cramped. Shortly after boarding completed the cabin lights were switched off with on the screens and seat belt signs providing any light. The captain announced that we would be delayed due to heavy traffic along our flight path. No cabin crew were around to answer any queries and any calls for them were ignored. We eventually left Dubai over an hour late. The rest of the flight was unremarkable. The crew were not very friendly and didnt seem too bothered. The breakfast was ok but again the portion size was very small. After landing the I noticed that most of the cabin crew seemed absent with only one stewardess standing by the door. She did not bother to smile or say goodbye to anyone.
Just last week flew on Monarch from Gatwick to Sharm. Second time in two years flown with Monarch and generally impressed with standard. On return trip I would say the crew were a little too social sharing conversation with colleagues a bit too openly and snacking drinking during services before flight etc. On the whole would fly again unless a legacy carrier were to open up a route. Would guarantee my custom if they were to offer a wider seat or separate cabin for a premium.
I would not bother with them. Delayed flights multiple times and so we missed our connection which was also with Turkish Airlines. The staff in the airport were horrendous to deal with. I was travelling with a toddler and they tried to get us to pay for the next flight and insisted it was my fault we missed the connecting flight when it was their fault the plane was delayed and got to Istanbul just as the boarding for our next plane started with only 30 minutes to get to the other side of the airport and through security. The refused to provide accommodation or any food vouchers whilst waiting for our new flight. They left us in the airport with more than 24 hours with a two year old. Our family contacted customer service who were also horrendous to deal with. Honestly never experienced the depth of dismissiveness and gaslighting by an airline especially considering I was travelling with a child and we ended up having to sleep in the airport and now both ill from doing so. Dont bother with them they do not care
Ho Chi Minh to Singapore. Misleading information on website which stated that airline provide 20kg checked in luggage. Instead they claim that I did not purchase luggage and was force to pay for the check in luggage. Which cost a lot more than the going and return air ticket price After repeated email to the service desk they brush the issue away. Even after requesting 3 times to speak with someone higher up they was no reply from them.
Bangkok to Singapore. My IFE unit screen was not working as the screen went fuzzy and shaky when turned on. The FA tried to restart my system but it did not fix it. As no other seat was available I was struck with no movie entertainment except for the music for the whole flight. Crew on this flight of the Singapore Airlines standard. They did the usual greeting when boarding preflight drink and hot towel. Hot Towel is something not many airlines offer. Bangkok is not one of the country where you can book the cook but the foods were not too bad with a Thai dessert on the tray. The cabin is clean even though this is relatively old plane. That might explain why the guy 2 rows in front of me also has the same problem with the IFE unit. Overall it is an average experience.
Excellent inflight service from Montreal to Doha and return. All of the cabin staff were very courteous and helpful. Overall an excellent travel. Thank you.
Delhi to Dallas via Tokyo. The ground staff in New Delhi could not print boarding passes for my onward travel from Tokyo at Delhi at the checkin counter. When I asked them at the gate again they told it could have been done at checkin counter but cant be done at the gate now. I reach Tokyo I am told to reach the gate without boarding pass. I spend my time panicking whether I will get a seat on the flight so much for a relaxed travel and transit. Online checkin did not work since I am nonUS passport holder. Ground staff shows up at the gate and I finally get a boarding pass but get stuck on a middle seat for next 11 hours which could have been avoided if I was checked in at New Delhi. Also I had called up JAL 3 days earlier requesting a special meal for all my flights but the request was only put in for the first sector.
Everything started great with them. The booking process was surprisingly easy especially with COVID19. I booked the ticket for my girlfriend to come and visit me here in the US and she said the flights to Seattle with them were great and she had no complaints. About a week before she was going to depart Seattle to go home she got sick and had a positive COVID test and I had to suspend the ticket. The process of suspending it was very easy because I just had to send them the PCR test showing a positive result. But now sense she has recovered we have been trying to get the ticket reissued and have been trying for 2 weeks now. They have been extremely slow and been lying constantly about returning phone calls and making false promises for the new rebooking. As of now I have sent the positive PCR results in 3 times to them and am starting to go around the same loop again. I will update this as more news come.
Flew from LGW to Catania. Lounge at Gatwick was good and staff very attentive no lounge at Catania airport and given vouchers instead which we got a rotten cup of coffee from the BA approved cafe next to the non Schengen passport control. Flights both ways were good and we liked the Pilot pointing out Lake Geneva and telling us about our route so nicely. The return flight back to LGW the Captain was hard to hear and wasnt so interesting. That aside on both journeys we felt well looked after with charming FAs. The food was also good too and we landed on time. Baggage came very quickly at LGW but at Catania airport it was a bit of a carnival Im afraid Catania airport is the worst airport Ive been through but there you go I think it is one of the joys of travelling.
Washington DC to Hong Kong. Boarding was done efficiently and we were shown to our seats by cabin crew. The purser came up to introduce herself and happened to be a very chatty Japanese lady who was sweet and helpful. The seat was comfortable but I was surprised by the lack of storage space at sitting level. There was a small storage box at the bottom of the seat and one by the armrest which I didnt dare use for fear of leaving stuff behind. The flight left on time and we had options of a quick supper or a full meal. I opted for the former and was served a rack of lamb which was beautifully cooked. The accompanying vegetables were overcooked and I was surprised that service comes on a tray instead of being brought out course by course. There was also no dine on demand but there were snack options available throughout the flight. There was no mattress for the seat so that was a minus for me. Otherwise the pillows were adequate and there was a duvet which I didnt use as I found the cabin too warm. The IFE was good and responsive and we were given good quality headsets. There was a very basic amenity kit provided. The crew were proactive and responded to calls quickly and were always pleasant. There was breakfast before landing which again was served on a tray and there was no spoon provided to stir my coffee Overall I like flying Cathay but it pales in comparison to the Business class product of Qatar airways. It was a nofrills business product but then again the seats were quite comfortable crew were nice and the plane was clean and brand new.
London Heathrow to Miami return with British Airways. Delay outbound and back with poor communication of both. Told of a delay which was extended once we reached the gate and on the return journey and then again once on the plane. Service on the return journey seemed like stewards were going through the motions rather than worried about the level of service. I does seem that the British Airways flights to Miami and back to London Heathrow have very poor punctuality when alternative airlines dont have the same issue. Inflight entertainment on inbound flight not fully working after a reeboot which was done because some passengers had no service for the first hour.
Spirit Airlines canceled my flight home from Las Vegas to STL 20 minutes before we were supposed to depart. After paying 303 for my luggage 89 for a carry on 89 178 for a checked bag over 40lbs. I waited hours for my flight only to be canceled just a few minutes before. At the ticket counter after waiting an hour they could not get me a flight to St. Louis for two days Also I would not be accommodated for these two days meaning no hotel food or car reimbursement. The only thing they did for me was switch my flight to Chicago not even close to my destination and that flight was still the next day and again was not my destination. Spirit could not get me home even though thats what I paid for. I spent almost 24 hours at the Vegas airport had to go through security three times and pay 550 total in baggage fees. Ive never had such a horrible experience with any airline in my life. Please do not fly with Spirit. It is simply not worth it. I am an inner city tier1 art teacher who works two jobs and barely makes enough to pay rent. These baggage costs and inconveniences are a huge expense for me. Not only was I disheartened I felt like I was completely and utterly scammed. I also felt like there was absolutely no care taken in trying to get each passenger an alternative flight. I mean I wont even be making it back home to STL. Ill be in Chicago. Then its on me to find a way home.
Hong Kong to Taipei with Cathay Pacific and again another unsatisfactory flight. The worst part of the flight is the impolite cabin crews. No smile no greetings and even worse wrongly advise passengers of whether there is a need to fill in the immigration form. The crews were only passionate in selling duty free items. Food was bad. The only good part was the AVOD. Dragonair has much better service on the regional routes. As compared to my previous flights with Japan Airlines and Korean Air Cathay Pacific has much worse service.
We flew from Toronto to Cayo Coco and everything went as it should have. On time both directions decent food and great cabin crew. Lots of legroom but the plane could have used a good cleaning. I would fly with them again.
Singapore to London Heathrow. A good flight with Singapore Airlines on a half full aircraft that allowed many in economy to have two seats each. Service quick and efficient and lunch and dinner of great quality. Water juice served constantly. Singapore set the bar for the best that economy anywhere can offer. Pity the app and website were not up to that standard. All in all 10 out of 10 for the flight. Also the ticket to London was very cheap too bought on line from an agents
Dubai to Mumbai. I had a horrible experience travelling on July 4 from Dubai to Mumbai. First of the flight got delayed by a full 6 hours and reschedule time was notified by email just 6 hours before departure. This caused inconvenience to me and a lot of other passengers who were traveling ahead. Second the ground staff was only shouting at passengers at Dubai airport to keep away and no explanation for the delay. In the meantime the flight further delayed by an hour. Apparently the flight did not take off from Mumbai and ground staff refused to check in passengers till it arrived Finally we boarded after an 8hour delay with no explanation or apologies from ground staff. They refused my cabin baggage saying the flight is overbooked a term I heard for first time in my ten years of international travel. After boarding I was shocked at the condition of aircraft. There was torn seats no security handouts. I missed my onwards flight as well. This airline is pathetic I would never ever book with again.
Puerto Princesa to Manila. Flight was delayed for 1hr 20mins with no notification. Only realised when the boarding time exceeded its stipulated time and no ground crew were seen at the counter at all. After half an hour the crew finally appeared. Asked the ground crew what time was the flight arriving and they said they dont know just wait with a bored face. Flight finally departed 1hr 20mins later which caused me to miss my next connecting flight. No notification no information provided no apology and no help rendered.
Flight from ZRH to YVR and back. A 10 Hour nonstop flight I had the best service. Very kind crew who served something to drink every 30 min. The meal was very delicious.
My flights on November 17th return from Bangkok to Buriram has been canceled without reason. They promised to refund in the 45 days but finally you not get any refund. No response when you contact the company.
Luton to Newark return with La Compagnie. The deal of business class flight with five nights at a central NYC hotel was right up our street. It turned out to be a very successful and enjoyable. The flights were very good and punctual. Helpful and friendly staff very comfortable seats good entertainment but the food was the star. Delicious and well presented. We used the business class lounges and at Newark our boarding card got us 20 duty free discount. Highly recommended.
Let me first get over my neverending grumble about how awful European Airlines Business Class seating is an economy seat with the middle seat blocked and no extra legroom. However my frustration was eased considerably on my flights with Air Malta. Yes it was the same layout 3x3 with the middle seat empty but with about 2 inches more legroom and slight recline which actually did make a difference. And the seating was surprisingly comfortable. The flights both outbound and return were on time and the cabin crew though disengaging understandably due to covid were however polite and professional on the service front. On both flights a premeal drink of fruit juice and prosecco no champagne was offered. On the outbound flight a delicious lunch was served all on one tray consisting of several small items and a hot main course of Maltese Beef Bragioli stuffed meat bundles. The presentation was excellent in traditional Maltese ceramicware known as Zingla bowls. Lunch followed by coffee and drinks from the bar. On the return flight the typical breakfast of egg bacon mushroom and tomato a bit boring was served. Both the mini bread rolls and croissants were warm. Overall I did enjoy both flights and was better than many other European airline flights I have been on.
KLM baggage systems fault that baggage was not loaded for most of the passengers on that specific flight however the ordeal followed after trying to figure out the whereabouts of the baggage is horrible and unexplainable. Apologizing without intention to help is not considered an apology. Had a flight from Amsterdam Schiphol to Berlin Brandenburg airport on 28th June via KLM. I was going for 3 days corporate event. Landed in Brandenburg airport on 1703 CET awaiting for my checked in baggage at belt 9 After about 30 min of waiting there was an announcement where I learned my bag was never loaded on my flight and left at Schiphol airport. I went to the customer service counter filed the report on the missing bag received a file reference which i need to use for follow ups. Since the 28th June evening I have been trying to find my bag which I really needed due to a big corporate event I went to Berlin for. Carried a checked bag due to gifts for collogues coming from different countries. I flew back to Amsterdam Schiphol on 1st July without my bag. Had to buy stuff in Berlin where had no time to spare. So much inconvenience for an hour flight and 3 day visit. Today its the 6th of July I dont know where my bag is. The hassle and harassment I had to go through past 1 week just to get some info on my bag is horrible. Going forward I would do everything humanly possible to avoid KLM flights.
London to Melbourne via Brunei. This was our first time for myself and my partner travelling with Royal Brunei. We were a little apprehensive but it was the best long haul flight we have had in a long time. Great customer service planes were in good condition and flew smoothly good food lots of seat space. All in all a great journey. The price was 1000 cheaper per person than any other airline at the point of booking. I would highly recommend Royal Brunei.
Bangkok to Krabi. I had to cancel my flight because of the Coronavirus. The airline was very difficult to get in touch with by phone so I tried the PG Live Chat. It took 2 days to be able to speak to someone so I was imagining by the time I did speak to someone the quality of the service would be low and I would have to argue my way to a refund. But the service was quick and accommodating. The representative spoke perfect English. She asked why I was getting in touch asked for my flight information and confirmed that she had cancelled my flight for a full refund just moments later. She also found in my record that I had purchased travel insurance along with the tickets and told me hold I could get that refunded too. Now the refund will take 30 days because of the high volume of refund requests so well see if I do in fact get my refund. But in terms of quality of customer service Im very pleased and impressed.
This was the worst airline I have ever been on. Our flight was supposed to leave at 330 and we left around 930. It wasnt weather based it was just them be slow and terrible. Then we were boarding and we had to wait even more. Their reasoning they forgot to clean the plane. It blows my mind you can run something this poor and still have a business.
I always travelled with them this trip coming into Sydney was cancelled 3.30 hours and today 30 September 2019 going back to Brisbane boarded flight on time and then went in the runway. Told technical problem which is radar these things should be checked in maintenance everyday people like us we boarded this early to be at work on time on a Monday morning I had a salon to open to service a client at 9am Im not unreliable. The staff are so rude on the floor which is worst at least they should be friendly and help. We have to pay lot if prices if as a passenger we only have 2 kilos over they dont have mercy on us but when they in fault no drama. They still show you attitude if they are at fault.
Seoul Gimpo to Shanghai Hongqiao return for a long weekend. As with all Gimpo international flights it was 100 full and extremely short. Plane was clean in good condition. Only a bottle of water was given with a tray of food. Ignore the food as its just beef and rice in some kind of sauce. The food seemed the same in both directions. As far as cabin service all of the Korean staff were polite. GMPSHA there were a few obviously tired and sour Chinese attendants wearing a visible frown and throwing the food on the tray. At 240 USD round trip all in I dont really care about the service on these short flights. No seatback TV but again the flight was barely an hour and a half. No time to watch anything. The plane was clean leg room adequate and surprisingly on time given Chinese airspace. Id fly them again on this route.
Johannesburg to Durban return on Comair British Airways franchise. Check in and bad drop at JNB took ages. Staff at counters slow and could not care less. Security was a breeze. Slow Lounge had good selection of food and drink but was overcrowded on a Friday evening. Departure delayed at the 11th hour and flight left over an hour late. Flight operated by a very old Boeing 737400. Smooth flight. Good crew. Bags out fast at DUR. Return check in fast at DUR. Slow lounge at DUR much better presented. Return flight left on time. Crew on flight some what indifferent. Flight arrived on time into JNB and bag outs fast. Overall reasonable product.
The customer service at the counter is the worst. I had to pay for a weight upgrade when I was carrying the exact same weight and bags that I did a week earlier in Sydney where I was not charged for it. The airline only cares to take as much money as possible from you. I was suggested that in order to take my combined weight down I put on as much of my clothes as possible which was humiliating as people who saw me doing so laugh at me. And even after going through that upsetting experience it wasnt enough and I was then told that the could allowed up to 7.9 kg. My only two options by then were to try wearing the suitcase which in is own weights 4 kg or pay the 65 upgrade. They didnt even send my bag to the AFT deck. I paid that money to take the carryon luggage with me. Whats the point to pay them
We flew from London to Manila via Dubai and back. Boarding wasnt stressful. Legroom was good and the seats had a good recline. It was enough for me to sleep when I needed to. However I did get very numb towards the end of the flights. At 89 hours per leg this wasnt unexpected. The quality of the food was good. I had the gluten free meal and my partner the normal. Both flavour variety and good portion sizes. I didnt feel like the gluten free option meant I had substandard food so I would take this into account if you have any intolerances. The entertainment was very good. We were spoilt for choice for films and TV shows and the inflight status was a nice extra. The larger screens were on two of our flights and were much more responsive than the smaller older versions on our other two flights. For the smaller screens we just used the physical controllers but these were easy enough to use too. All of the staff were highly professional prompt and courteous. We had a few smiles as well. All in all Im very happy with my experience from Emirates. The flight werent cheap at 580 return but there were many cheaper options available. Im glad we chose to pay the extra 100 for Emirates as the extra comfort went a long way for such a big journey.
Worst inflight experience Ive ever had. TV Screens not working nor there is a facility to call crew seats are broken and the food served was pathetic. Had to wait for 34 hours to get even water during flight. Heard Bad reviews about Air India before and thought there will be improvements after Its acquired by Tata but no difference. Never travel again if possible completely avoid.
Appalling treatment following cancelled flights and no customer service response. We travelled from London to Colombo over the Christmas period. We booked our tickets earlier in the year and paid a premium to fly back on Saturday 4 January and ensured the flights had one short stopover as we were travelling with 2 small children and 2 elderly grandparents. Oman cancelled part of our flight on the way over and put us on a 2 stopover flight which added an extra 6 hour delay to arrival time and inconvenience at the additional stopover in the Maldives. Oman cancelled the entire return journey on 4 January and the next available flight provided was on 7 January but did not inform us that was a 2 stopover flight Despite paying a premium for a Saturday one stop flight and getting transferred onto a Tuesday 2 stop flight no compensation has been accepted. The complaints service are non responsive and simply do no respond to a complaint. We will never be flying with Oman again
Full flight efficient boarding friendly greeting from Purser. Flight crew kept us updated on hold up efficient and adequate inflight service for a short domestic flight cabin interior immaculate. I had no checked baggage so from the plane to the Tube was just 7 minutes.
I had 2 bags one carry on and one checked in bag that I paid for. On my way from Canada I had no issues. Everyone was lovely and things were okay. On my way back from Nice to canada. The staff asked me to pay for my carry on luggage as the measurements were bigger than usual. I informed them that I had no issues coming to nice with that same luggage and was checked in by a Lufthansa employee. The customer service at Nice airport was horrible. I shouldve been informed of this when I was departing from Canada. There are no real standards or rules. And obviously it varies from airport to airport which is extremely stressful. This was a Lufthansa staff error. they still had me pay for the bag.
Tenerife to Birmingham. I would like to say a big thank you to cabin crew on flight departure from Tenerife at 15.35 on 14032019 to Birmingham. Excellent cabin crew my partner fell poorly after about 40 min after take off. They looked after him very well within 10 min he felt a lot better.
After reading many reviews I was sceptical to be flying Austrian Airlines and concerned my luggage wasnt going to make it. We flew BKKVIELHR in Business Class and both flights were excellent. Check in at BKK was very smooth and we were advised of a 1 hour delay to the flight which was a little concerning as we had a 45 minute connection we were asked to continue with the flight and if the connection is missed then Austrian will sort out a new flight and hotel upon arrival in VIE. We used the Singapore Airlines Lounge at BKK airport which was outstanding excellent service food drink selection. We were priority boarded on the 777 and met by very friendly and smiling crew there was a pre takeoff drink offered which included champagne orange juice or water. The seats were full flat beds slightly older style but still very comfortable for the 11 hour flight there were 2 full meal services on the BKKVIE leg as well as a snack service midflight. Food and drink selection were excellent. Crew were very friendly throughout the flight i asked about the connecting flight and they were able to confirm near arrival that the onward flight was slightly delayed they told us the gate number to head to as well. Upon arrival at Vienna Airport we were able to get between the 2 flights in less than 10 minutes and we made the flight to LHR. The A320 was brand new and had USB charging sockets onboard we were served a Christmas Dinner in Business Class along with a drinks service the crew again were very good efficient and friendly. The business class seat is the same as most European carriers with the middle seat free and a little bit more legroom. Upon arrival at LHR we were pleased to see that all of our bags had made the connection and waiting for us on the carousel. Overall I was very impressed with Austrian Airlines and will definitely look at using them again for future flights.
I fly frequently LondonBakuLondon BakuAnkaraBaku and find AZAL very comfortable and a fair price in comparison with BMI. Cabin crew friendly business class service and overall experience is very good. Flights are mostly carried on times and with great professionalism from the pilots. Ill continue using AZAL in future.
Flew from Manila to Tokyo and JAL regional from Tokyo to Sapporo. The flight was quite pleasant and seamless from the the check in to the flight itself. Food is usually a chore on airlines but I really enjoy JALs offerings. I dont really have complaints for any part of the trip since they really make it seamless for you. I guess I would just like more international connectivity as their domestic flights already have wifi I wish they could offer even with a fee wifi for international flights and perhaps keep it free for domestic.
London Johannesburg via Tripoli return. I took the precaution of travelling hand luggage only and making sure not to use the bathrooms during the stop over at Tripoli and was pleasantly surprised. The service matched any Ive travelled with over the years and at half the price. Considering they offer the option of twice as much luggage in the hold as any other airline Ive travelled with I might even travel with lots of luggage next time
Flew Toronto to London in British Airways club world on avios and companion voucher. Prompt check in at Pearson with friendly staff. The club lounge is well run with dinner served as this is a sleeper service. A good choice of food though though the wine list remains unimaginative. The lounge is too small when busy. Additional toilets are needed too few with queues before the flight was called. Friendly staff on the flight with lights out after takeoff and a tray service offered. The dessert and cheese and drinks was perfect before an ok sleep. The flight is too short for a decent sleep and the club world layout is now dated and in a real need of a rethink. Once cutting edge its not fun being stepped over by a stranger and there is a real lack of privacy. Breakfast was ok with the hot muffin being a confused offereing. Returning from Heathrow 10 days later started with a very slow check in process unusual for T5 with agents blaming cancellations from the previous day spilling over. Went straight to the club lounge on the B gates which is a hidden gem quiet well stocked few children and in good condition. Pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to first on arrival in the lounge . A superb flight with BA first at its best. Decent vintage champagne before take off friendly engaging and professional crew made the experience really first class impressive given the cabin was full. Great Rose Champagne an excellent wine list especially the reds and well cooked food. A movie afternoon tea and we arrived head of time into Toronto. The bags almost beat us off. BA can be variable in service especially in Club World and some of the cost cutting in recent years though these return flights reminded me of the old BA and how good it can be at its best.
Istanbul to London Heathrow with British Airways. The main reason I pay to travel Business Class is to get extra leg room. BAs Club Europe now gives you exactly the same leg room as in Economy which may be okay for a quick hop to Paris but is definitely unsatisfactory on this near four hour flight. It was particularly annoying to see children sitting in row 1 the only row with reasonable leg room. Service was fine and the food quite good but no entertainment at all. From now on Ill book Economy and pay for exit seats its a nobrainer. Either that or fly Turkish Airlines an airline which is going from strength to strength.
Worse service ever misleading information also they will charge you extra money in each step so if your ticket price is 1000 Aed then you will ending up paying 2000 because of their stupid policies. If you dont like then they ask you board other flight
Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The inflight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK I award the meal 6 out of 10 but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland 4 out of 10. It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the worlds best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only the front door. The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
Birmingham to Delhi via Paris. Upon arriving at CDG we had trouble finding the gate so I enquired from an Air France member of staff to help the response I got was read the board appalling. The flight was ok. Thats where it ends I received a text to say my luggage would not be arriving. 2 days later I made countless useless telephone calls and I am still waiting I am now in Nepal with nothing. I was told by Air France my luggage would not be on the next flight out of CDG as the plane was at its weight limit my luggage was 13kg. I have received no further communication.
Spirits whole model is built on deception low base fares and then pay for everything from bags to seats with your travel mates. Unfortunately the rest of the industry is reducing service levels to try to compete. Spirits relationship with their customers reflects that deceptive approach. If you prebuy something like wifi you might find the plane doesnt have it. And then getting a refund will be of course not easy. These guys can be ok if you go in eyes open. But you must treat the low initial fares are the deception that they are.
Maldives to Boston via Dubai. All I can say this was the first time I had traveled on Emirates. As much as I have heard of this airline this was the worst decision. With 12hrs flight haul it is understandable that the trip will be not very comfortable. But with the crew on board that cannot get you water until to press the button on you seat 10 times and finally they get annoyed by the pings and decide to come ask you how they can help. As one attendant told me we are out of ice. just seconds later asked a different crew member they got me some ice. Seats are tight you have to lift your shoulders and still touch the person next to you when eating your meal. I have took Qatar Airways before for a similar ling flight and had a very conformable journey.
A disappointing trip that would be so easily made better. Actually my first ever trip on Turkish airlines. And it was poor. I understand that we are travelling under different circumstances at the moment but they could do better. To serve a flavourless cheese roll a peach juice and a small water as replacement catering is unacceptable. Does the ME3 who compete with Turkish do likewise No. Crew were not interested in the customers and after handing out the cheese rolls remained mostly hidden at the back of the aircraft. I asked for a wine but was offered a second water. Again disappointed for what was not a cheap ticket. I was offered business class too at a competitive cost but glad I did not take that option in case of similar poor service standards. Worth noting that check in and ground crew was fine. IFE too looked goo but I did not participate. I think my oneoff experience with Turkish as a ME3 alternative will not be repeated.
Left EIS Sunday 22 Dec 6.30 pm due to arrive SVG 10.30 pm. Delays in both St. Martin and Dominica. No explanation or updates. Finally reboarded after going through security check every single time at 10.30 due to arrive SVG at 11.30 or so. While in the air was told by the pilot that SVG was closed so had to go to Trinidad. Arrived 1.30 am. Had to pick up bags at baggage claim. Told to go to Gate 19 by 3.00 for checkin. I assumed they meant 3.00pm but no 3.00 am. Of course no one at the gate and it was finally manned at 4.00 am. Gave us 5 USD food voucher at about 4.00 am. THAT makes sense Finally LIAT staff arrived at 5.00 to issue boarding passes and told us to go to gate A. Went to gate A and found out that all flights told to go to gate A for a 6.00 am departure. Appalling customer service. On the way back home was just as nightmarish with a stop and layover in Antigua. No one around to tell us anything and after a 5 hour delay the plane appeared and we boarded.
EFLATHLHR return. Cant fault a thing really good snacks and coffee served on the short hop to Athens a good hot lunch dinner served by very attentive crew on LHR sectors seating comfortable with more than adequate leg room although some form of entertainment would have been appreciated. Service only slightly marred by being told by a crew member that they would only serve me two white wines as if I was some school child All flights on time baggage delivery at LHR painfully slow though which needs some attention but not really the airlines fault.
No food or drink expected for an international flight they said because of covid. This is ridiculous people not eating or drinking for hours. If you paid they should provide the food. Awful Entertainment. No many movies or music to select from. I dont recommend it at all. No breakfast no wipes for your face after sleeping before arriving. I will never fly on this airline again and I dont recommend it.
Lisbon to Moscow. I was excited to try Aeroflot but had read some concerning reviews. This flight proved that Aeroflot offers very good service We could choose from three options for breakfast and trust me it was delicious The aircraft was just fine and the seats comfortable. The staff are nice but could chill and smile just a little more. Or maybe it is my approach to service. Also if I check in online having to wait on a long queue at the airport just to drop off doesnt make much sense nowadays. The same goes for not having the boarding pass on the wallet but having to have it printed
Flew KUASIN. Short flight competently managed. We were charged heavily for overweight baggage 20 kg over for two people the fee was as much as one ticket. Check in staff and flight crew were friendly and helpful. The ATR turboprop used was as comfortable as expected but this 185 cm passenger asked for the exit row row 1 after boarding.
Toronto to Heathrow my last flight with British Airways. Checkin and security efficient and quick lounge was fine and the food provided for preflight dinner was tasty and perfectly adequate. Departure about 45 minutes late but this time was made up with a 5hr 55 min trip. Cabin comfort and service pretty much the norm for British Airways Business Class no storage around the seat and the IFE screen did not work as usual. Breakfast has improved slightly the fruit was varied and edible croissants warm but the bacon and egg muffin was unfortunately cold. Arrival processes fine.
Kuala Lumpur to Venice via Istanbul. The flight from Kuala Lumpur was real packed. I was seated on 50G. It was rather hot during the flight. Meal was plenty and tasty. I also like your special menu and unique drink such as sour cheery drink and home made lemonade. They are fantastic Most cabin crews on Kuala Lumpur Istanbul sector were nice and polite except one male crew looked grumpy but he still did the job well. Nothing to complain from Istanbul to Venice. Toilet was clean and with proper amenities. We got nice blanket pillow and nice pouch Kuala Lumpur Istanbul sector full of flying amenities such as lip balm socks eye shade toothbrush and ear plug which are nice. AVOD needs improvement on film and song selection. Need to provide some asian movies and songs including in ChineseMandarin. You have ones in Malay but not Bahasa Indonesia although you also serve Jakarta airport. Wifi is on and off. A bit frustrating indeed. Other than that I have nothing to complain.
Very happy with Akasa Air services. This is the 2nd time Ive flown from Agartala to Guwahati and vice versa and was happy to note that both ground and onboard staff were helpful courteous and well trained and maintained their standards. They had ontime departure and the aircraft was clean and seemed new. I would fly it again.
This was a redeye flight from Hong Kong to Tokyo. Very efficient self bag drop at Hong Kong International Airport. Organised and efficient boarding. CXs regional seats are fixed back seats thus proving very uncomfortable for a redeye 4.5 hours flight. Inflight entertainment audio jack malfunctioned although fixed by cabin crew after 30 minutes. Extremely poor catering only a snack box a tiny sandwich chocolate brownie fruits and a piece of shortbread was provided as opposed to full warm meal for a daytime flight on the same route. No choice of drinks only a 250mL box of lemon tea no water tea coffee etc. Arrived at Narita on time but walk from gate to immigration is extremely long nearly 10 minutes. Due to arrival in early morning very efficient at immigration and luggage reclaim.
Terrible experience with British Airways I was obligated to checkin my carryon suitcase due to my group number according to the girl at the front desk. Then they could miss my two suitcases plus the luggage of my boyfriend who traveled with me. After 3 days they delivered 2 of our 3 bags and since then the promise of deliver the last one persists. Now already 10 days passed and still no information of where the last suitcase is. Always the promise that the bag will be delivered today but it never happens No respect with the customer First and last time with British Airways for sure I dont recommend at all
Business class is total fraud Twice the price. Total waste of money 1 No priority check in in Lanzarote. Despite 3 million tourists a year coming through the airport in Lanzarote they dont have online check in. But 50m queues 2 hours before check in like it was some developing country in 1984. When check in opens they briefly check in business class then allow economy passengers to move to the business queue which is then always blocked. No staff checks if you have business ticket or not. So unless you are 2 hours before checkin there is no priority check in. This time there was an Edelweiss person but he didnt do much good compared to the other times where it was just I dont give a damn Swissport personal. Waste of money. 2 There is no priority security. 3 There is no priority boarding. A lady shouted faintly business once waited for 20 seconds then started boarding all other passengers. Didnt matter since we all ended up in the same overheated bus anyway So actually if you go early during this 20 seconds window of priority boarding you end up waiting longer than economy. 4 The food is just some microwaved slime. 5 The seats are exactly the same as economy class on this flight. Yes there was a seat free in between but how is that more comfortable if the seat itself is small and short leg room. 6 The carpet was dirty the seats old and ripped. Never again will I book business class with Edelweiss. A total rip off.
The counter staff made us pay for a premium economy seat instead of the normal seat. We checked in at around 0845hours she claimed that there are no vacant seats in the center area and that if we I and my husband to sit together then we have no choice but to take the premium economy seat. We asked her that if really no seat available for isle and center she said no more and we need to sit separately both in the isle. She seven said that its a full flight. In which well on fact its not there are a lot of vacant middle seats in the economy area how can this be.
I took this early morning flight which at the time of booking was a pretty good reasonable rate. The online check in was done smoothly and at the airport the bag drop was also done well and swiftly. Boarding also started well on time and was surprised to note that this was a full flight at such an odd hour and the aircraft type was the bigger A321 for this sector. I had noticed that there was a passenger who was having slight difficulty but the crew was able to talk to her make her calm which was a good thing to see. Also surprisingly on this flight sector I had noticed that there were snacks being offered on this flight as previously on this sector they used to give only a sandwich. I had opted for the non veg refreshments which consisted of pasta with chicken along with a nice chocolate cake for dessert and the food quality was pretty good. Landing and arrival into BLR was also well ahead of time. However when the time came to collect the baggage I had noticed that again the new bag tag which I had attached with my name was no longer present and this was a bag tag that I had just purchased recently and put. Even last week when I travelled from Kolkata to Mumbai even then my baggage tag was removed off so it seems that Air India is having issues with my baggage tag and probably this is something that they need to look into. But other than that this was a welcome flight and I am hoping that the next time I travel they give refreshments service rather than the plain sandwich that they usually give.
Flew MIALHR in First. Seats 5a and 5k. This was my first time in BA first and I was really impressed. From the moment my boyfriend and I walked up to check in to the moment we left the plane we were very well looked after. The food was nice and particularly enjoyed the buddy dining. My gooseberry crumble went down well. I got around 2 hours sleep as the jet stream and storm that was hitting the North Eastern U.S made our flight very bumpy but also super fast. Flying time being little over 7 hours 20 mins. I must mention the cabin crew who were very helpful and professional. We bought the seats in the sale and it was money well spent.
I flew to Kazan from Moscow Domodedovo for a weekend visit on S7 Airlines on 10 and 12 February 2017. Flying domestically within Russia is very inexpensive so it is affordable for many people. The result is that both flights were at capacity. Boarding was late on both flights starting at the time the gate was supposed to close according to the ticket schedule. As with other Russian airlines there is no preboarding or boarding by zones. Once the gate opens it is a rush to board. It is important to board early on a budget airline like S7 because with bag charges everyone tries to carry on as much as possible and the overhead compartments fill quickly. Despite the chaotic boarding both flights departed close to schedule. On both flights the cabin temperature was uncomfortably warm for me but if you live in Russia you know that Russians like it warm very warm. I sat in economy and although I dont consider myself tall at 180 cm my knees were pressed up against the seat in front of me Absolutely no leg room at all. If you are taller than I am you will be very uncomfortable. See my photo It was a short flight only about 90 minutes. The flight attendants were very businesslike and focused on getting the passengers a meal and drinks in the short time we were airborne. A bland sandwich and your choice of water at cabin temperature or hot tea was what you got. More than one would expect on a short flight but not very high quality. I would have preferred just a cold beverage to cool me off in the warm stuffy cabin. In the end the flight was what you would expect for 8000 rubles 138 USD Not great but what do you expect
Disaster customer service. Cancellation of flight and after reschedule requested airport check in. Waiting for service center agent took 1 hour and 21 minutes
Changes not allowed Flight Delay. Redeemed my flight ticket using enrich points for return trip from Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu using Malaysia Airlines. I am a platinumemerald on One World but my experience with Malaysia Airline is is bad. MH has gone to a low class airline. My flight at 2040 and checked in at 1700. I asked if I can board the 1820 flight or 1930 flight but was not allowed as the redemption ticket is not changeable. I am not able to pay to change and was offered to buy another ticket if I want to. See this is the kind of airline that is cheap. There were seats and plenty but no flexibility and consideration. So I question why should I ever accumulate Enrich or fly on MH. Then come to boarding time at 1940. Plane arrived at 2010 and two announcements made i 2020h that flight is delayed due to operational reason and passengers will be updated in 20 mins time ii 2043h that flight is delayed and passengers be updated in 20 mins time. Malaysian Hospitality is a far away from what you have hoped. There are much to be learnt and catch up.
I booked my first ticket on June 9 to travel by July 1 they cancelled it I called them to ask of the next flight they told me its for July 15 and its confirmed meanwhile I am already pregnant and never planned to have my baby here in the UAE my visa is also cancelled so I could go back home again they cancelled the flight on the 7th July I called to ask when is the next repatriation flight they told me no repatriation flight except until August 3. I visit them yesterday 9th July and to my surprise I heard that there was a repatriation flight that left a day before which was on the 8th July and also another one is scheduled for 14th July meanwhile I called and kept calling and even use their chat platform just to let me know if there is any repatriation flight to Nigeria but seems all the customer care I spoke with were poorly informed how can you as a customer care or telephone operator or ticketing officer and you dont know there is a repatriation flight just to inform your clients. The biggest shock of my life was the lady at the ticketing office on 8th July around 2 pm 5 pm she shouldnt be working as a customer service personnel at all she is badly mannered she does not display any form of empathy all I explained my situation to this lady and what she said was all flights for July has been cancelled and its not only you. My point is if you cancelled my flight and I already told them my situation why cant they just inform me that theren is a repatriation flight they just displayed a nonchalant attitude meanwhile i have been following up with their flight for more than a month and several repatriation flight left and still non of them informed their customers about this they are only happy to cancel your flight taking advantage of the situation without even informing of the next and available options for their customers. Till now I have not been able to get any ticket and I have to leave Dubai this month July 2020 unfailingly and I heard there is a repatriation flight for 14th July still they have not been able to put me on this flight despite my condition.
Lisbon to Sofia with Bulgaria Air. Tasty sandwich served onboard along with complementary bottle of water on boarding which is a nice touch however for a four hour flight it didnt seem enough. The aircraft seemed very old and almost decrepit with very worn out leather seats. It was the first time I feared for safety when travelling. There was much turbulence on departure from Portugal. Cabin crew were young and rather unprofessional. They seemed as if they wouldnt want to be bother. The flight departed and landed precisely on time. My biggest problem however was legroom which made this night flight atrocious.
Stuttgart to Madrid. Cabin crew friendlier than customers. Wifi to see movies on the cellphone easy departure and punctuality. Finger use in airports never had to use a bus to get to the plane. It does not seem a lowcost airline at all and I try to use it whenever I can. The only but is that the cabin crew are too permissive with customers leaving their backpacks in the trolleycabins. If you get late to the plane you might not have space because of this.
Very pleasant flight from OKA to ISG. Relaxed but very professional and friendly staff. At least one member spoke English. Maybe the least full flight I have ever experienced 10 in a B767 I was quite surprised that they use such a big plane for this route but it seems they only use this model on this airline. I had to buy a luggage allowance since my checked bag exceeded 15kg but the fee was quite decent 500yen. Same as for the drinks service I remember coffee is only a 100yen 1 nothing to be angry at.
The online checkin went fine but it was impossible to change my seat which should be possible. Contacting the customer service was a very time consuming effort but eventually I could reach them and they could change my seat. The checkin at Brussels was somewhat cumbersome as the checkin staff was overzealous in checking and double checking Corona requirements. There were about 25 people in line when I arrived but it took a good hour to get checkedin. The boarding went smoothly. The flight was ontime. Also in Helsinki the boarding went smoothly and was on time. The flight went fine flight attendants were attentive. The meal was very minimalistic and I am being polite... the fact that it was served with wooden cutlery did not add to the culinary experience either. Drinks were ok and soft drinks available throughout the whole flight. All in all it was a good flight timely without any stress.
JNBVFACPT. Not problem of the airline but getting through immigration at JNB is a hustle. Airplanes were clean and new. Going to VFA we had 20 min delay and returning we had 1 hour and half delay. Service was good and if you ask they bring you pillow and blanket. Food was great also in the international and in the domestic service. Echeck in was 24 hours before flight time but in the domestic flight you could not change seat selection. Seats were comfortable and seat pitch was great. Overall a good experience.
Upon family boarding my daughter and I sat in the first 2 rows of the aircraft we boarded the plane early. I put both our carry ons above us. I was soon interrupted by an unhelpful nasty flight attendant stating you need to get you bag up or I have to check it. I quickly got my bag in and it fit fine the woman watched me struggle with no help. Then after the plane had fully been boarded someone boarded the plane that also wanted their carry on to fit my bag was then removed and placed further in back to place their bag where mine was. After drinks were served my daughter and I werent able to finish our drinks as a different flight attendant wanted to take our garbage and said we werent allowed to finish our drinks. When we were leaving the plane I asked the flight attendant where my bag was and I was told they didnt know and now I we had to wait until the entire aircraft unboarded so I could get my bag. Once I was able to locate my bag it was in the exact position it originally was in but further back in the aircraft. My daughter and I were treated very poorly as we exited the aircraft by the flight attendant with a snarky condescending tone have a nice day. Not sure how I feel about flying Southwest anymore with my family. We spent a lot of money on tickets and if we boarded early our bags should have had priority over the late comers and we should have been able to finish our drinks and throw the garbage out when ready.
5 days Missing luggage. Credit gift card offered as compensation for the missing luggage had No Credit. 5 days into our 7 days vacation and only now was found in Toronto. It never left the airport. Sunwing website not functioning and No one to reach. My kid is 8 years old. He prepared for this trip a long time ago. Preparing his bag was the most exciting experience to get ready for beach time after two long years of quarantining and online schooling. And finally its time for a vacation and beach time. Our air flights were booked through Sunwing airlines. We arrived to Cancun and his luggage is missing. No where to be found. We had to leave the airport. Its now Thursday and we arrived to Cancun on Sunday. We pretty much bought all what we can from the limited gift shop at the resort that fits his size. Which were 2 shirts a swimming suit and something for his foot. Plus a toothpaste and tooth brush. And thats all what they had for him to wear. The airlines representative at the resort was trying to help us file a report online on sunwingcares.ca and the website is not working. He had to communicate this information and do the report manually through someone on the other end. Then he said that Sunwing will give us some compensation credit on a gift card to use as a thank you for your patience and understanding. As much as the credit gift card wont make a difference. I was still very appreciative and tried to get my little one to still enjoy and focus more on the trip and try to manage with anything we can get from the gift shop. But again As I was paying for something for him to wear. The card Sunwing gave us as a compensation declined We left everything on the counter with the girl at the gift shop and ran out to bring any other personal credit card to finalise the purchases. These were all a series of disappointments with Sunwing. I remember the name of the Sunwing representative Andres at the Riu resort cause he was initiating all the possible ways to help us on his end. Also forget to mention that the Sunwing team at the airport did not file any report and did not initiate any action. They kept directing us to get on the bus to go to the resort. I thought that may be we should get it by next day or so at the resort I assumed this might rarely happen but would get straightened out by next day cause there is a team in charge and I can pretty much rely on the reputation of Sunwing airline and their service. Unfortunately Im surprised at the service offered from the airport team. I can understand that covid and the pandemic had put a lot of pressure and strain on airlines but also thought this is an opportunity to score such an experience with more clients to use Sunwing airlines again and again since we were considering our next trip already with the friends and group who came with us on this trip. I look forward to see how Sunwing customer service can handle solving this issue. Otherwise I dont want to repeat it again with Sunwing and wont recommend it. First issue my little ones luggage is still in Toronto. Second issue if you offer a compensation please do it right. Third I hope your Sunwingcare website starts working for others who would be in my position and might have valuable belongings in their missing luggages. The least thing is to get someone to communicate clearly
Cheapest ticket like half the price of other airlines but you definitely get what you pay for. For an international flight no food or beverage offered except with purchase and obviously onboard pricing is 3x normal. A couple delays and thankfully connections were with them too so it wasnt a problem. So if you dont mind a little discomfort and being nickelled and dimed for the small conveniences that are courtesy in other airlines then go for it.
KLM had promised to issue me with a flight credit for the price of my ticket for cancelled flight. After countless hours and back and forth in the end I was given a flight credit in time. What I was given was not useable by me and efforts to request monetary benefit was not given. Extremely frustrating and wont fly with them again after being a loyal customer for a decade. Goodbye to KLM
Horrible customer service. After being on hold for hours on end not a single agent was able to assist in changing my flight time. Completely incompetent and unhelpful staff who cannot process a single email. Will never recommend this airlines and never use it again.
London to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. Really impressed with the hard products and 9 abreast seats in B777 economy. Even more impressed with the live television services though limited channels. I would not have imagined watching a UEFA Champions League World Cup qualifier game whilst travelling intercontinental. Food is good relative to other airlines. Was relieved that my checkin luggage made it through to Kuala Lumpur after there was a 50 minutes delay from my departure at Heathrow. At Istanbul I was off the plane and straightaway dashed to my connection gate. Made it into the connection to Kuala Lumpur but was resigned that my luggage wouldnt make it and may come in on the following flight. Thankfully it reached KUL together with me. One reservation about the hardproduct is seat pitch especially on the A330. Im 6 foot 1 and really feel the tightness. Not much improvement on the B777 but perhaps bearable for a 9 hours flight.
My flight from Manila to Macau was cancelled 2nd February at 7 pm just as I was supposed to embark. First excuse the Honk Gong government closed its frontier. Ten minutes later they said that the Filipino government wont let any plane coming from China to the Philippines. Still I want to go to China I am not coming from there. So what does it have to do with me again Afterwards they told me that every company in the Philippines are forbidden to go to China Hong Kong and Macau. Finally a good reason but why did they lie before Because I was in transit and didnt have the stamp they put me in a hall. There they took my passport a really stressful situation. They wouldnt tell me what was happening and what I could do. I was anxious because the day after I had a flight from Macau to Taipei and from Taipei to Paris. I needed to go to Macau as fast as possible. I was sitting on the floor hungry tired and scared of the people of Cebu Airlines. They talked to me as if they were talking to a dog. I asked if I could call my French embassy with their phone they wouldnt let me I broke my phone the week before. Finally at 11 pm they came to me and asked me to take another flight to another place. Luckily I have money can you imagine someone who doesnt How would he or she do I had no other choice than to take a flight to Paris at 7 am. At 2 am they gave me my passport back. What did they do with it Why did they need it I left this hall of despair right after and finally got to take my plane back home. Guess what its only after that I learned that the Philippine airlines wouldnt go to China. They lied to me again. I could have taken a flight with AirAsia to China. Now about being refund what a swindle They first didnt understand my request. Because I had received a boarding pass they thought I got on the plane. Dont they see on their screen that the flight was cancelled Right now I am being refund of a modest sum. I am not even thinking about who much money I spend with international calls. Their website is of no use. I didnt catch my flight from Macau to Paris via Taipei because of them. I had to take another flight from Manila to Paris because of them. Cebu Pacific is the worst airline I have ever taken. Their service is no service.
Singapore to Chennai return. The outbound flight was excellent in terms of being on time the inflight service was impeccable. The seafood that I normally order was very very good. The flight crew were friendly and helpful as I needed some help with ordering in flight duty free goods. On the return from Chennai to Singapore the service during the flight was bad. The cabin crew with their robotic attitude were interested to finish the service as soon as possible to disappear from sight. Other than that I do not have any complaint to make.
Tel Aviv to Bangkok via Tashkent. The whole family we are with two young children 3 years and one year. We were preparing for this flight for long time because flying with so little children is not a simple task. Before us there was a considerable selection of companies that offer the flight to Bangkok including some Israeli companies with flights even cheaper than Uzbekistan Airways. After much deliberation we did choose to fly with Uzbekistan Airways because we also realized that the company has improved in recent years and in terms of flight time with small children it suited and it was important for us to land early in Bangkok since we had a flight from Bangkok to Koh Samui Island. And from there boat to Koh Phangan Island. The last boat leaves at 16 so landing in Bangkok at 640 am promised us an early arrival to Samui without having to stay there overnight but straight to continue to Koh Phangan. I would like to point out that on this journey we left with the full weight since we are planning a long stay on the island. So it was very important for us that the road be continuous and without unnecessary stops with children and so many luggage. In practice everything happened the opposite The flight from TLV was delayed in 5 hours. Not speaking about the food and the bad service during the flights we arrived very exhausted to Bangkok at 13pm. We waited for 3 hours for the next flight Our flight was at 940. We arrived to Samui much later after last boat to Pangan. We had to search for a hotel carry all the suitcases and children. We arrive to Phangan in delay of day which included all unexpected and unwanted expenses for taxi food lodging not to mention the levels of fatigue we all came to. I was sorry for the moment when we decided to fly with this company. The experience was terrible I do not wish anyone
LHRSTRLHR. First time using GW and was quite impressed. Price was good especially as it was from Heathrow. Plane was fine and as we had a Smart fare we got 32 inch leg room and a 23 kg bag which was excellent. Seats were the modern thin style which was OK for such a short flight but Im not sure Id like to do more than two hours. Staff on both flights were efficient rather than friendly which they probably needed to be on such a short flight. The smart fare also included a a drink and a snack and to be honest I wish they hadnt bothered because it was quite definitely the worst inflight meal I have had in over 40 years of flying. The snack consisted of a sandwich of turkey in soggy brown bread which was totally inedible a small bottle of water and a tiny Toblerone chocolate. I also made the mistake of having tea which was tepid dishwater. My tip would be to avoid the sandwich and have juice to drink. This was really a small disappointment in an otherwise excellent experience and I would have no qualms about recommending Germanwings.
Santiago to Sydney via Auckland with LAN Airlines. I read some discouraging reviews before flying but my experience was quite different. The check in was swift and efficient departure on time both legs. I flew both ways with the new aircraft the cabin crew was welcoming and polite. The toilets kept clean throughout the flight and entertainment system kept us busy. The downside was the food during such a ling flight you would expect to receive two hot meals but for the breakfast we received only a small warm sandwich. It would be nice if during the flight also some snacks will be provided. Otherwise all filled my expectations will fly LAN again.
Flight from Bangkok to Dubai with Emirates is operated using an A380800. Business Class is on the upper deck in a 121 configuration of 76 seats. Although the seat reclines to a flat bed it is very narrow and uncomfortable. The large 18 cabin crew worked hard but the service feels chaotic. Rather than work zones they work service items. There is a bar with an attendent. If you do fly business on EK A380 alone chose a window seat which a storage locker for personal items. This is not an intefrnational standard Business Class. Food quality is good. My vegitarian meal was fresh and enjoyable. Meals are served on trays not plated. Wine is generic. A drinkable Bordeaux was offered.
We flew three flights from Melbourne to London. This is the standard route for Royal Brunei they fly approximately 7 hours from Melbourne to Brunei then 7 hours onward to Dubai and then 7 hours to London. This is obviously a few hours longer than a one stop flight. The flight attendants were great and the food tasted fine. Bring your own headphones because the supplied ones are awful. The seats are ok nothing special. This airline is a good value option.
East Midlands to Dalaman return. The whole experience is budget with no inflight entertainment or food provided take your own. The refreshment prices on board are very steep 3.50 for a can of pop take your own or be ripped off. I suppose you get what you pay for. The plane did look a bit tired with sticky tape over holes in the arm rests and the seats are crammed in economy style. A four hour flight was enough.
I dont know where to start with Qantas. If I could Id so choose another airline. Due to my work I fly Sydney Tamworth and return every week. The return flight is frequently delayed last week by 3hours. The excuses are usually technical errors sick crew etc. And when the plane then finally arrives in Sydney with significant delay the connecting bus usually waits for 15min before unloading passengers. Whenever I raise it with the airline the usual excuse is we certainly aim to depart on time. Im so over Qantas.
Insel is a poor excuse for an airline. They treat their customers like dirt. Flight from Curacao to Havana was informed to be 1 hours 10 minutes late at checkin October 3. The plane was present at the gate. 1 hour and 20 minutes after the original departure time the screen went black no audio information. New sign on screen the plane was now due for Miami Asking about our flight to Havana we where informed it was delayed 4 days come back on Friday. Most stupid thing ever heard who on holiday can change their plans like that It cost us approx. 200 USD on phone to get new hotel room at Curacao and to cancel our hotel in Havana. We still had to pay for the first night another 115 USD. Also tried to call Insel Air which have so rude staff on the phone just saying no refund then put you back in the phone queue. Before this flight not taking place we flew from Miami via Curacao to Bonaire both flight very much delayed arriving at Bonaire after rental cars had closed so we could not pick up our car. Also from Bonaire back to Curacao delayed. So before cancel to Havana three flights all delayed. We noticed that the flight to Miami that was announced instead of Havana was three hours late so we realized that we had to rebook our return ticket from Curacao to Miami as we had connecting flights going back to Europe. These new tickets by another airline company also cost us. After trying to communicate with Insel which is more or less a one way communication we finally got information that our flight CURHAVCUR is valid one year same for our flight CURMIA. However they do not understand that people in Europe very seldom have the possibility to travel this far every year we cannot afford it anyway so we have absolutely no use off that offer.
Worst staff and not at all concerned. I had travelled all the way from Solapur to Mumbai to catch my early morning flight to Jabalpur and after standing there in the checkin line for 2 hours they say your flight has been rescheduled to the evening after 12 hours and no communication was made to me for this rescheduling. In fact I was getting upgrading and priority services messages but no message for flight been delayed. The staff at Mumbai airport didnt even bother to convey this very well. Pathetic airline. I wouldnt suggest it to anyone.
I miss the prepandemic Singapore Airlines. I have flown with them on a regular basis for decades and am disappointed at how bad the first flight I took with them since the pandemic was. My flight was purchased from Air Canada and AC is the first marketing carrier as per US DOT rules. AC is also the most significant carrier. I have clearly researched my baggage allocation prior to the trip and packed appropriately. Unfortunately the SIA check in staff were clearly unaware of their own companys baggage policy see pictures below and refused to allow me to check my three bags. I had to repack my bags at the airport which is both embarrassing and a complete hassle. I have never had to do this in my decades of leisure and business travel. I will definitely think twice before taking a flight with SIA again in the future.
I take a yearly trip to Tunisia and Ive flown with a lot of airlines over the years. I have encountered delays and issues with flight logistics but it was always handled smoothly and professionally by the airline. This time I tried Air France because they offered a trip without much waiting time before the corresponding flight and what a huge mistake I made. First trip from Montreal to Paris was cancelled out of nowhere. No explanation was given and the only heads up I got was an email that was filtered as a spam since they sent it through a shady email. They rescheduled that flight for another one that got delayed for 2 hours. No heads up this time and of course no explanation. The cancellation and the delay made me miss my corresponding flight and instead of getting the first flight available to Tunis they booked me on a flight 13 hr after I land in Paris. I tried to find a solution with the airlines customer service in Paris Orly but according to them there was no flight before the one I had in 13hrs even though there was and they scheduled it for some of the people in the line. The AF customer service in Paris Orly were really difficult to deal with they will ignore you if they dont like the question asked for directions on how to get to the airport hotel and how I can do an online claim on the issue some of them will yell in frustration if you ask the same question twice I was really tired and I couldnt really hear them well over the counter. Needless to say that this is my first and last trip with AF. I really recommend anybody flying long distance to avoid AF at all costs they do not seem to be able to handle the logistics of a corresponding trip.
My wife and I flew Business Class out and return because of poor reviews. We were part of a group of holidaymakers. The Skyteam Lounge at Heathrow can not be faulted. We found the aircraft to be like many others with the odd fault my wifes inflight entertainment selector wasnt working on the return journey but she sleeps so it wasnt a problem. We had very attentive and pleasant staff with a choice of meals and drinks. Alcoholic drinks are available on request. The seats were very comfortable and reclined not too far from flat. On the return journey the Lounge at Tashkent had limited snacks available and alcoholic drinks had to be purchased. Boarding was swift and efficient. TIp the Duty Free shop on landing is much cheaper than the Duty Free in Departures. We have absolutely no complaints about Uzbekistan Airways. Our fellow travellers in Economy were pleased with their journeys except that they had no choice of food. On the outward and return journeys there were not many Economy passengers. As a result they were able to sleep across three seats. Business Class was full. We read dire reviews of Uzbekistan Hotels too that were completely unfounded. The City Palace Hotel in Tashkent was excellent by any standards. The Asia Hotel in Fargana was another excellent hotel in rooms away from the noisy road. Dont believe everything that you read about Uzbekistan transport or hotels. I hesitate to label previous contributors as moaners but that passes through my mind. Hotels tend not to supply plugs for basins and baths take your own. Uzbekistan is a developing country and making a good job of it. They do need to make a good push to improve the quality and cleanliness of public toilets which in some cases can only be described as dreadful. The i.pad has films but even if you choose English language you get Russian.
Flew Virgin America from New York to San Francisco. From the service at the counter to the flight itself though tired from flying JHB to JFK international 15hrs this was a pleasant flight smooth clean elegant and very kind crew. Im wondering why I havent used Virgin before now. I was impressed.
Birmingham to Goa via Doha. he food served to me was not great on the return journey it was worse. The breakfast was described as scrambled egg but mine was one big lump. The stewards were very good. However there was an incident where my glass was taken away prematurely a sorry wouldve been nice. The seats being able to recline is a problem that needs to be addressed. The woman in front was determined to use her body weight to get the seat as far as back as possible. Luckily she was understanding and moved the seat forwards but not so was the lady next to me on the 1st part of my return journey who wouldnt even speak to the stewards let alone move her seat.
Traveled MCTCOKMCT outbound Economy and inbound Business. Had a good flight both ways. Food was okay for this short flight. Crew attentive and service oriented. On time performance. Had a good experience with Oman Air. Clean aircraft and timely performance.
CGNTXL A319. Evening service after Cologne Carnival parade. Lots of passengers and even captain disguised accordingly. Boarding delayed due to late arrival from previous flight but crew managed to catch up departure on time arrival 10 min early. Crew quite neutral whereas Captain made funny announcements in view of the carnival. Seat comfort is okay for such a short hop. Only buyonboard program with relatively high pricing compared to quantity of products so I opted for nothing. Germanwings is low cost and you practically pay for everything you want extra besides the seat. Germanwings has taken over complete service from Lufthansa on that particular route. Being Star Alliance SilverFTL at Lufthansa means nothing if you fly on Germanwings a 100 Lufthansa subsidiary. Some weeks ago in 2012 when LH still served the sector FTLs were allowed to use the LH business lounge. Now they offer you lounge access for an insignificant fee of 25 what a joke
The worst airline i booked with ever it is not comfortable and I booked flight from DelhiSharjahAmman. Delay happened in Delhi but i arrived Sharjah 15 min before departure of Amman flight and it is same airline so they should wait for 10 min. Instead Air Arabia employee took my ticket and change my flight to another flight after 6 hours and gave lunch and Breakfast vouchers which means nothing for me. I dont recommend this airline to anyone.
Cork to Moscow via Paris. Delayed flights on both trips ended up missing a connecting flight as a result. Appalling service on the ground in the airport. Luggage severely delayed despite being promised it would be put on my new flight with me. Absolute disaster.
Glasgow to Bangkok return via Dubai with Emirates. Reasonable check in in both Glasgow and Bangkok. All flights arrived pretty much on time even if late in departing. Usual variable cabin crew with BKK routes soso but much more attentive crews on the Glasgow legs. Economy class food seems to be improving in recent years though I think the IFE choice of films is not as good as it was. No remote stand bussing in DXB which is an improvement. Good availability of flights and good prices which are the main reasons I choose Emirates though they are now charging 20 per leg to preselect seats in advance of the 48hr online checkin window which I find ridiculous.
I booked the flight on Oct 8 but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that I cant get my entry visa in time for the flight. And I did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled. But in the cancellation email the booking reference number is a different one. So I requested cancellation but BA canceled another persons flight and sent the confirmation to my email I assumed that my flight was canceled but after more than 3 weeks I still have not received any refund so I reached out and it turned out my flight is still on And it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to BA. I tried multiple different ways phone calls and emails but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty. Based on my experience no ones reads your email carefully no matter how much context you put in. Given all I have experienced I have zero faith in British Airways.
I booked Bangkok Don Mueang to Luang Prabang Nov 2 2016 but I was flying to Bangkok three hours before my flight with AirAsia. 6 days before the flight I receive and email from AirAsia that it was rescheduled so I wont be able to get on this flight because instead of three hours I will have only 15 minutes between my flights. They provided only two options I can take any other flight on the same route within 7 days of my original flight. Or I can receive a refund with AirAsia credit not cash which I can use only within 90 days. So my options are to spend a night at the airport or pay for a hotel in the city from my pocket or get useless credits which I cannot use because I will be leaving the country. Live Chat is alway unavailable I tried it before and had the same results. Eform answers are always by template no one really cares to read your messages they only provide some default answer depending on keywords in your message. And when I tried to contact them by phone after third attempt someone finally picked up the phone I listened for intro messages for couple minutes and then the guy on the phone told me exactly the same what was described in the email. Superb support service
Flew Ottawa to Halifax. My wife and I want to acknowledge the fantastic care we received from an employee of Porter Airlines who helped us so much at a very difficult moment at the airport in Halifax. The other agents also took great care to change our tickets that could suit my medical condition after I suffered from an unbearable migraine while landing onto Halifax airport. Thank you.
For our last holiday my wife wanted to go to Paris before it was it was impossible due to ill health. We booked Newcastle to Paris return with Vueling. On the Orly to Newcastle return we arrived on time seen flight cancelled. Went to check in and told no problem and come back in one hour for correct check in time. Went back and told the flight was cancelled. We asked for help from the Vueling desk they looked at my phone and found the flight was cancelled at 02.30 in morning. We were not up then. She told me we were booked the next day to Gatwick not Newcastle. We asked for help with hotels phone food nothing but told book with Air France to get to Newcastle. We were at the airport my wife who is 74 years old and attends a memory clinic and I have severe hearing loss with 2 hearing aids and heart problems she is my wonderful ears and I am her guide to keep her from wandering off as she loses direction. I had to get us from Orly to Charles de Gaulle book a hotel and to our check in the morning after. Sounds simple you try it deaf with anxiety off the scale. After 10 emails complaints about treatment they put 148 pound in our bank. Not acceptable the flight alone cost 500. They give me some reason of weather problems. The one thing I would like to say that young French people are wonderful and helped us many times in the holiday. We were totally disillusioned with Vueling and their CEO Marco who we contacted twice with no response. But congratulations on the profits you make from peoples misery and upset. I did cheekily suggest to him to save money was to sack all customer service and put in an automated answer phone in saying do not bother we will not pay out fair compensation. Please do not do that. Clearly they are only following policy which comes from the top and they followed company policy regardless of how they really feel. Do not let old age and health problems stop booking flights get the correct insurance with a good airline and you can a have a wonderful holiday.
This was the first time I have flown with BA and I have to say I was very impressed. I flew economy from Brisbane to LHR return. Via Singapore on the outgoing trip and Hong Kong on the return leg. The experience was so much better than on previous flights I had taken with competing airlines. The cabin felt spacious and comfortable even in economy. There was a good range of inflight entertainment and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The cost of the flight was a little more expensive than other airlines but having been very satisfied with the service it would not preclude me from booking with them again. Would preference them over other airlines now following that trip along with recommending them to others.
Johannesburg to Amsterdam via London. After many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at 8pm. The following night at 7.30 pm they announced further delays due to the same technical fault reported 24 hours previously. Finally departed at 10pm consequences were missed connecting flight to Amsterdam. WE also had to pay for our no show at our hotel in Amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from BA they declined but offered to pay for our taxi Arrived in Amsterdam 30 hours later. What really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled. Once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated. Our connecting BA flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking.
Denpasar to Dili. Selected Row 1 seats during booking process and confirmed through airline website seats were still selected. At checkin was told Row 1 is only for VIPs and was moved to Row 10. Asked if Row 29 available and told they were booked. After take off I noticed only 17 people in the first 9 rows. The Citilink ground staff in Denpasar care very little about their customers.
Flew Manchester to Seoul via Doha. As a 5star airline I expected high things from Qatar Airways. Whilst my experience was perfectly adequate I wasnt overwhelmed. The terminal they use at Manchester Airport couldnt be further from the train station and Economy checkin was pretty average. Flight and food were fine. Staff quite attentive. Doha Airport looked fantastic but organisationally it was a bit haphazard. Having also flown to Seoul with Lufthansa from Manchester and with British Airways from Leeds Bradford my only reason to choose Qatar in future would be a cheaper fare.
London to Kinshasa via Kigali. More than 2 hours late with hard to explain poor customer service. We have been lied to multiple times about our departure. Our bags were intentionally left in Kigali and the number provided for lost property is not answering. We found other peoples bags on the floor at the airport in Kinshasa. I have to admit that RwandAir is a company that I wont ever fly unless it is the only company. Horrible experience
I had flights from Paris to Sarajevo via Ljubljana. Adria Airways provides a low cost product these days. The food and beverages become for purchase including water. This is acceptable for short flights but it should be clearly indicated during the ticket purchase on their website. There are no hot options and quality of sandwiches is really poor. Besides the service was very friendly and efficient. Both flights arrived on time.
I paid for priority check in and priority boarding for me and my partner on our outbound flight from Birmingham on 26th June and our inbound flight on 3rd July. At Birmingham we ended up going through the normal check in as the priority check in was busier and in Palma the priority check in lane was full of normal check in passengers and if my partner hadnt complained to the check in staff we would have had to line up with those that hadnt paid. Even then we had to wait behind a large family that had commenced check in although they hadnt paid for priority. At boarding the staff member just allowed anyone through onto the plane even though he had used his tannoy to state that priority boarding passengers would be loaded first. Monarch offer and charge for a service then fail to deliver. It is one big scam.
Quintao to Whuan on time. Reasonable legroom. Cabin clean and crew attentive and polite. Good spoken English but announcement barely comprensible. I would rate this airline as slightly better than Chinese average.
Two return flights on AmsterdamSofia route. Both times on a new and clean A319. Staff generally friendly and helpful good selection of drinks onboard. The worst thing is the small seat pitch only 29. The A319 in twoclass configuration has 144 seats with 3 additional rows in Economy Class. The sandwiches they serve consist of tasteless bread and cheese. For 10 months between the 2 flights the food remained unchanged. Ground service is slow and staff inefficient. Online checkin is limited only to flights taking off from Sofia and going to particular destinations.
Glasgow to Dalaman return with Thomson Airways. We were in seats with extra space in row 10EF both ways. These seats had a great amount of legroom. Flights left on time both ways landing about 30 mins early on return to Glasgow. Crew were fantastic and very friendly. Flight deck gave regular updates on the flights. Food and drink onboard was okay and I didnt mind paying the price. If you are buying duty free on plane would advise buying on outward journey as not a lot left on our return flight. Another excellent flight experience with Thomson.
Flew British Airways from GIG to LHR. Nice easy check in with no extra charge for an overweight case. Got 4 seats together even though we couldnt check in online. Enough legroom for a tall man. Staff were all great and very friendly and helpful. 2 meals which were pretty good for an airplane and drinks on request. I emailed a request to let my father in law see the cockpit after landing and they pulled out all the stops for him. Made his holiday. Our Wheelchair was waiting at the aircraft door when we got off. Couldnt fault them.
Worst flight with Qantas. We used to fly Qantas quite often to Australia before covid but my friends and I have had a terrible experience with Qantas on a recent trip to Bali. Our flight went via Sydney which was delayed for an hour by the time we made it to Sydney we had to sprint to get to our connecting flight to Bali our friends were told that there baggage had to be collected in Sydney to then be checked in for the flight to Bali which made no sense as it was an international transit. So half of us made it to the gate just in time where we were met with rude staff who blamed us for not telling our friends that they should have come straight to the gate as their bags were already loaded on the aircraft along with ours but we didnt want to go against what they had been told. So our friends missed the flight To top things off our baggage was not on the flight even though the staff at the gate told us everyones baggage was on the flight. So we spent the first 3 days of our trip in Bali with no clothes to do the activities we wanted to do our friends arrived a day late they were not put up in a hotel by qantas they had to buy a room themselves and we were only compensated 60NZD which got us either a cheap shirt and shorts or bikinis for 3 days. Were all sick of Qantas after that trip definitely worth paying an extra few 100 for quality service on Air New Zealand.
Manchester to JFK via Heathrow and back. Positive experience although the flight from Manchester to Heathrow was delayed outside BA control we were constantly informed about the delays. Attention to detail was excellent. BA upgraded our flights at our request promptly and without any fuss Silver wedding Anniversary. The flight attendants were excellent and the food and drinks was tasty. Some passengers can be somewhat critical about BA but we were more then satisfied with the service.
Purchased full fare economy refundable ticket and upgraded to business class using my SU Bonus miles. Flight was cancelled by Aeroflot. To date unable to get my refund despite numerous calls to Aeroflot call center. All they are trying to do is offer me to use a voucher despite my ticket fare being subject to a full refund. No timeframe given as to when the refund will be processed. In addition my upgrade miles are also not processed and returned to my account yet. Aeroflot has strict rules when you are buying and paying but they seem not liable to follow any binding rules with regards to refunds.
Gatwick to Antananarivo via Istanbul. Never again. The food was disgraceful on the outward flight. I was bumped from my seat despite having pre booked it 5 months previously. On arrival my suitcase had one wheel missing only the lining prevented the contents from spilling out. I obtained a damage report and tried to visit the Turkish Airlines office in the airport twice during my stay. Never open. Before boarding for the return flight I tried to get the airline to at least cover my suitcase with a plastic wrapping. They were beyond insolent. On arrival at Gatwick the other wheel was missing. I went to the Turkish Office and they said a new case would be delivered to my home address in a week. Over 2 weeks and still no sign. Instead multiple emails requesting I fill out forms I have given all the evidence requested. Still no compensation prevarication all the time emails that one cant reply to. Turkish Airlines have ruined my case it is irreparable.
I waited in the check in line for 3 hours because it was under staffed after my flights was rescheduled and had to ring Jetstar a number of times to sort it out. Now my flight has been pushed back a day later when I have wedding to attend.
I was traveling with my girlfriend to Vegas and then onto San Diego for a short 5 day vacation. When I booked my flights I had the option of selecting my seat assignments. We chose to sit in the emergency exit rows or as close to the front as possible. After I chose the seats the airline confirmed they were our seats. When we left out of Akron Canton airport we were in the last row of the airplane. No big deal. It was a 1.25 hour flight to our connection. The next flight they didnt even have us sitting next to each other. She was two rows behind me on the opposite side of a full plane with both of us having middle seats. Nobody trades you seats for a middle seat. We had three planes to board out of San Diego on our way home. Not one time were the seats next to each other. Why offer me a opportunity to reserve my seats and then not give them to me. Was it because someone paid the extra fee to take my seats Probably. I sent US Airways an email to ask them why this happened. Their response was sorry I hope you choose to fly with us in the future. The flight attendants are rude. The customer service is horrible. There is no chance I will fly with them again. On this trip we flew from Vegas to San Diego on Southwest. I had never flown with them before. I was always leery about flying budget airlines. Never again will I fly US Airways.
Wonderful regional airline from Luebeck I had a chance to try this airline and the experience was quite comfortable. Boarding procedure is in order and each passenger must disinfect hands. The legspace is good and cabin is simple yet neat. The crew were happy to engage with passengers and the best part was that they serve a small meal on each flight I really appreciate that and the meal was simple yet very tasty and filling. You can even book a veggie meal while booking flight. Beyond what LH can even offer on regional flights. While deboarding they served caramel candies. This experience with Lubeck Air took me back to old school days which I miss terribly in aviation world. Keep up the standards and service because this will set you apart
JNBLUN. Flight left on time old plane but comfortable food was insipid flight attendants friendly but too much chatter amongst themselves. All in all an average flight. My problems started when I wanted to reschedule my return flight. Air Namibia office at Joburg airport could not help eventually had to purchase a return ticket on SAA to get back to Joburg in July and 5 months later I am still struggling to rebook my return to Joburg on the valid return leg I still hold with Air Namibia.
I was apprehensive before my recent flights with LIAT after reading these reviews. However I have to say that both flights were reasonably on time and quite pleasant. My bag did not make it today from St. Vincent to Barbados but it has just been delivered to my hotel so no worries. The tickets are expensive for the distance you fly but there is no other option. The Caribbean needs another airline to provide some competition.
I was meant to be flying with Wizz Air back from Athens until we were told it was operated by Titan Airways. However it was a pleasant surprise to climb aboard a Titan aircraft. The staff were extremely professional and incredibly helpful. I would happily fly again with them.
Melbourne to Sydney. Horrible customer service. I understand you get what you pay for however based on how horridly unhelpful the supervisor was today 330pm on 11th January I will never fly Tiger again. I understand the person I dealt with is possibly not working in what the would call their ideal job but I personally felt they took that out on me. No matter how cheap your flights are this isnt good enough. Life sucks but people like this and the workplace environments that enable them make it worse.
I flew back to Montreal last Saturday with OS. I could not believe my eyes and ears when we were told the seats at our gate were reserved for business class passengers only and that we had to stand or find other seats elsewhere. Over 75 of the seats remained empty until boarding. No other flights in this area had the section cordoned off. People were pretty upset and the poor agent got an ear full. In my opinion this is not acceptable and very upsetting and discriminatory.
Uneventful flight. No delays. Ryanair crew were friendly enough by Ryanair standards Window seat so not too uncomfortable. Usual multiple sales pitches squeezed into a 45 minute flight. Ryanair are never going to win any awards for service or comfort but thats not their intention. Considering the 15 euro fare no complaints.
The worst airline we have ever flown with. Exceptionally inefficient and very unfriendly staff. Long waiting lines no priority checkin line despite paying the extra priority fee for the whole family. We were traveling with an infant and the airline staff made us wait to board the aircraft last as they would not assist us with the stroller and gate check despite a very unhappy baby. Made for a very unpleasant flying experience. because of the lack of willingness to assist us from the staff as well as their very unfriendly manners we will never fly with Ryanair again.
We booked two tickets from Munich to Rome via the Alitalia Homepage and got a direct confirmation. At the airport we were informed by very unfriendly and slow staff that we would not be on the passenger list and Alitalia cannot transport us with the booked flight and we shall buy another ticket in an Alitalia flight 6 hrs later. The staff denied to provide contact to her boss and did not give her name. We had to book another onewayflight on the same day with another company spend 380 extra. When arriving in Rome we again contacted a service staff. She was much more friendly and informed us that Alitalia had some software problems resulting in bookings via the internet not being correctly processed internally. She promised that our costs will be reimbursed. We then contacted Alitalia to get our reimbursement. Unfortunately although we spent much time to precisely indicate all circumstances and additional costs Alitalia only reimbursed the 254 for the original ticket but did not reimburse the additional costs of 380 for the extra flight to Rome and we had to pay another 250 for the flight back from Rome. Furthermore and most disappointing Alitalia did neither give an explanation nor an excuse. We will never fly Alitalia again
Worst airline ever We had a flight at 610am Apr 15th but were able to change it at 500am around 1100pm Apr 14th the night before. We left our hotel on time tried to check in through the kiosk and it wasnt accepting our itinerary so we tried to check in through the counter and staff said we were too late Like what How does that make any sense Even though the airport is small and securitycheck in takes like 5 minutes with the gates right there apparently we were too late. Why give us the option to change our flight time on YOUR website and then not able to accommodate to us We were told that we had no other option but to rebook another flight which cost 19000 pesos in cash because they said they didnt accept card. We didnt have that much cash on us but luckily our friends who were with us lend us some. I had asked if they were able to reimburse if not all some of that money back considering we paid lots lots of and all they said was no sorry.
So we accidentally booked extra weight and did put and credit card or debit card and didnt pay for it. At Sydney airport they made us pay 100 aus saying we didnt pay for it as we didnt use the weight and the staff of cebu pacific said we would get our money back as we land in Manila. In a normal case they should have given us our money back but they didnt and said there staff at Sydney airport misguided us and never paid us back the money.
First off I paid for a first class ticket A lot of money I fly monthly and I always fly first class. When I got to the airport I went to scan my eticket which clearly showed I have a first class seat. The machine said I was too late to check luggage. It didnt make sense. I was 2 hours early. A very nice woman helped me and she fixed it and checked my luggage. And I got my luggage tickets and my luggage was marked priority. When I went to check in at the gate I was told to step aside. A female agent said the ticket not in the system despite my having my boarding pass. So she asked a male agent to assist me. He was extremely mean and rude. He said I wasnt on the flight. I showed him my confirmation email my eticket that showed my seat number and he said it didnt matter. I dont exist in in the system. He then assigned me a new seat in economy. I told him I paid for a first class ticket. He said you didnt tell me that. Ask for a refund. Had he actually looked at my ticket he wouldve seen that I was first class. I didnt want to make scene so I moved on. When I passed through the first class cabin my seat was empty. I do not know if it filled after but I was one of the last ones on the plane. I imagine it went empty. I probably should have just showed my e ticket and I could have sat down but honestly I was so taken back by the way I was just treated I wasnt thinking. I have sent an email to my travel agent to ask her how I can get a refund of the difference. I fly first class because I fly frequently and it helps me to me rested for important meetings. I spend a lot of my hard earned money. I was treated horribly by the agent at the gate. I do not tolerate that behavior and do not reward it with further business. I can tell you I will absolutely never fly American Airlines ever again and I will never recommend them to any body ever again based on my experience on this particular trip. I dont appreciate being treated so badly. There was no cause for him to be this way other than he enjoyed pushing his weight around. So American Airlines you lost a customer.
Aeroflot has a good planes and good pilots but the service was pretty bad the lines in Moscow airport are long and disorganised in Miami they pushed me to paid an additional PCR for couple hours of my previous test. Flight attendants let people occupy 3 chairs and sleep but you cant sit in the economy seat In front of the toilet because they call it economy comfort. They keep the plane extremely hot normal in Russia but extremely annoying for non russian. I will avoid it if I can.
I booked them through Chase Travel Portal. Unfortunately I missed my initial flight from LAX to Mexico City due to a check in error. I checked in on the Aeromexico app and received my seats AND the boarding passes. I get to the airport and Aeromexico said I didnt check in and explained that I had seats 11D and 11E but was unable to pull up the boarding passes on the app because it was too late already. An Aeromexico employee put my girlfriend and I on a standby list and after 8 hours we were able to get on a flight to Mexico City. Upon speaking with numerous amounts of Aeromexico agents and Chase Travel agents I was guaranteed a flight back since I did take a standby flight from Aeromexico. I wanted to confirm once I landed whether this was true and unfortunately Aeromexico said it wasnt the case and that I would have to buy a whole new ticket. I contacted their customer support and I havent received anything regarding that. I had to pay 800 just to get a last minute flight back to LAX. Aeromexico is absolute trash and I saw this with no respect what so ever. I review places on Yelp all the time and I NEVER give a bad review but Aeromexico wants me to be stranded in Mexico City without giving me a flight back home.
We checked in a bag and paid for it40 it had some tequila and I put cartons to protect them. We had 1 carryon each adult and at the counter they never said that we needed to check those in. At the moment of boarding they charged us 80 dollars each for our carryon. I could have put in my carryon inside the big check in suitcase and pay 40 to document the other one. Instead they made us pay 160 more at the time of boarding. They were rude and even yelled at my husband.
Helsinki to Hamburg via Riga. Small propeller aircraft not much space inside. Very impolite staff at Helsinki checked the hand luggage at the gate very exactly 60 if its even one more kg than allowed. Fee for choosing a seat even at online checkin. Bought a croissant at 5 very very small and dry. It seems that they just want to sell as much extras as they can got several emails with advertisings for that before my flight. And the the ticket wasnt even cheap. Will definitely never fly airBaltic again.
Great airline but sadly airfares costing too much nowadays. Yes regional services are more expensive but why fly when a 2 hour car journey is far cheaper. Staff at BWT generally are rude arrogant and do not provide a friendly service. Trying to connect to other airlines from REX is a nightmare because of the huge disparities in luggage allowance and even worse when you connect to an international flight.
Venice to JFK via Dusseldorf. Worst customer support ever. Cancel connecting flight with no agents at gate notifying you. Hundreds of passengers left hanging in foreign airport looking for someone to figure out what was going on. Lost luggage and then claimed not their responsibility it was the problem of airport baggage handlers. Customer service team not able to give Valid email or telephone numbers for assistance. Worst experience ever.
They never refunded my cancelled flight despite confirming that it would be done in 45 days. They never send you any email to confirm the cancellation they just confirm it by chat that they dont also forward to a email once done then they claim it was a no show and they cant trace back the he cancellation. Either they lie to keep the money or their system is so poor or inexistant which is quiet worrying for an airline. Lower customer service than a cheap budget airline. Would never use them again.
Toulouse to Munich via Paris. A not much frills but decent experience. All flights more or less on time aircraft clean and staff friendly and multilingual. Service is a drink and snack. Transfers in CDG painless. Seating however uncomfortable.
Cubana Airlines is the worst airline I ever flew with. We used the airline for a domestic flight within Cuba Havanna to Holguin. The flight was around 55 hours delayed the airline communicated nothing in advance and never said sorry for the circumstances. They offered no free drinks or a snack the information at the airport in Havanna was horrible. They only changed the departure time on the monitors. In Holguin the pilot was not able to meet to runway in the first attempt and needed a second landing. In Holguin Cubana needed 45 minutes to bring the luggage to us. My leather bag was impured with white color. Nobody at the Holguin airport no employee of Cubana felt responsible to help me. For safety reasons I would avoid dmestic flights in Cuba. They had no print tickets and wrote our boarding pass with a pen At the safety check they dont want to see my passport I will never again fly with Cubana and cant recommend this company to you.
Our ticket was from Beijing to Delhi flt no MU563 dated 28 April 19. We checked in at Beijing counter staff couldnt tell us whether flt to Delhi via Shanghai was on the same aircraft or a change at Shanghai was needed. Single Boarding pass was given from Beijing to Delhi with seat nos. My seat no was 38H. Aircraft at Beijing itself was delayed by 2 hours however no proper intimation given to passengers. Language was another problem at Beijing airport. On boarding none of the cabin crew could clarify whether we remain in the same aircraft on landing at Shanghai or deboard and change the aircraft. At Shanghai when aircraft was almost empty we were asked to deboard without further directions. On arrival at Shanghai terminal we were at loss for some time as no airline staff were available to direct Delhi passengers. Wheelchair passengers and senior citizens faced special problem. After 30 minutes seeing large number of people asking about Delhi flight one airline staff appeared probably on pressure from airport security. The staff herded us to various counters of immigration and full security checks again. We had to run at every counter to catch the flight. Things could have been well handled airline by making proper announcements at Beijing airport in aircraft and at Shanghai airport. China Eastern Airlines should take corrective measures in future.
Flew Tame to Galapagos in the Month of February 2005. Relatively new air bus A320 planes. Planes were clean and service on board was OK. Nothing special but functional. You expect them to be more friendly since in general I found the people of Ecuador friendly. Food on board was basic nothing special but more than you would normally get on most other carriers.
Delhi to Moscow via Astana. The Checkin staff at Delhi airport were more suspicious towards Indian passengers. The staff was asking more questions than the immigration officers. The ground staff was managed by Air India. And the staff of the Air India is the worst they were very rude and behaved unprofessionally. The inflight entertainment looked like it was from the 90s. There was no personal inflight entertainment system on board. The plane looked the older fleet. Cabin Crew was quite friendly. But the food was the typical. I expected Kazakhstan cuisine on board. Beef was not served on Board. And now the Transit part. Astana airport was of good size and very well maintained. But the problem is that the airport doesnt provide drinking water to the departure and transfer passengers and people have no choice but to buy drinking water 1 euro for 500 ml. Wifi was not working the login wasnt opening neither in my laptop nor in my mobile phone. Astana to Moscow no complaints for this flight because everything was perfect. From food to the inflight entertainment system. Returning Moscow Sheremetyevo to Almaty inflight service by the cabin crew was very good. Problem was that there was no personal inflight entertainment system. The Checkin staff at the Moscow Sheremetyevo was quite friendly and helpful. Almaty to Delhi flight was late due to transfer passengers. But it was not a problem because the duration was not much. The problem The cabin crew looked exhausted for no reason. The food served on the flight was only a light breakfast omelette and a small piece of potato cutlet which is not sufficient for a 2 hour flight. A complete meal should have been served. There was personal no inflight entertainment system. Only a screen on top at a distant which was playing a movie in RussianKazakh. Almaty airport was quite Small but well maintained. The airport looked crowded because of the huge amount of passengers. And also no potable water for passengers. Only payable bottled water.
They lost my luggage and I lost another flight for this. Right now Im continuing to try to have an help from them to deliver my luggage in Switzerland but Im receiving wrong information saying to contact other companies that dont matter Wizz Air and Transavia. Wizz Air was the company I had to take after Flynas. Nowadays after called infinite times sending emails chat on all social channels im not receiving helps and last days all of them are disappeared closing chats when Im asking something on their website or dont answering my emails. The worst company ever the worst customer service I could see in my life
Flew Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale with Virgin America. Air quality in cabin on both flights was very uncomfortable it was hot and circulation was poor. The crew were less than friendly at FLL checking in and there was only one person handling the massive travellers checking in for all three rows. Our seats were very uncomfortable. Virgin is not what it used to be.
I was flying Business Class from Sofia to Frankfurt. I wasnt offered welcome drink and the so called food is a miserable sandwich same one offered in Economy. Whats funny is that Economy gets bottles of water on their seats and Business didnt Ridiculous. The chocolate is not edible. In Sofia we boarded a bus to take us to the airplane which is unpleasant. In Frankfurt we landed so far away from the gates we travelled 20 minutes by bus Dont fly Business Class with this airline.
Perth to Milan via Doha using Qatar Airways. Checkin at Perth Airport was easy and seamless. I checked in online so I needed to do was to drop off my luggage at the airport. I have not flown Qatar Airways for more than a decade and I am really impressed with the improvements. Plenty of leg room and the seats are comfortable for both Perth to Doha using B777200 and Doha to Milan A330200. On both sectors I was well taken care off. The cabin crew were really friendly and helpful. I am impressed even on economy class we were offered three different options for mains and there is always a vegetarian option which is really considerate of Qatar Airways. There are plenty of inflight entertainment to keep me occupied for the long hours flight and the inflight magazine Oryx has plenty of interesting content to keep me entertained as well. Overall a good experience and I will recommend Qatar Airways to others.
Apart from the lie flat bed this is basically Premium Economy. The food is absolutely awful and totally substandard for business class. This is one of the main reasons I say it is more premium economy. The tray is not at all business class small and cramped. The plates not at all up to standard. My main was a sausage Can you believe this The accompaniment of hash browns were soggy because chef in his wisdom had them up against cabbage...which of course is wet. So a main of a sausage wet hash browns and cabbage. I didnt eat this mess. Disgraceful. My wifes salmon was swimming in oil and inedible. The dessert might have been acceptable but it was tiny...hardly a full spoonful. The drinks selection is basic. A two type wine selection for Red and white....no quality spirits...no dessert wine. No cheese board for after. The IFE is dated with a very small selection. The only thing that was good were the cabin crew. Excellent and I could see they were embarrassed regarding the food. No. This was beyond disappointing. We were totally surprised at their business class. We would not fly this airline again.
I usually avoid BA because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges but this flight was my only option. Note that BA actually charges for seat preselection in biz class 100 UK pounds in this case Does any other airline in the world dare do that I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BAs universally derided cramped 6across backtofront configuration where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arms length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement I wonder why No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings only to be told it wasnt available even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The bed is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest Ive ever seen in biz class it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all this uncomfortable miserly experience is hardly worth the 5727 that BA charges for this route. I used miles to pay for my ticket but of course got whacked with BAs unique and notorious fuel surcharge fee of 636 for using miles.
This airline flies under the banner of British Airways. I thought the planes looked old and tired. The customer service onboard was OK although slighly abrupt. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes. My flight with the same airline to Durban a few days earlier was also delayed for about an hour. When I asked for a customer service feedback form they seemed shocked that I should want to offer feedback. Needless to say there was no way to leave feedback with the airline. I wont be flying with them again. Luckily there is now quite a bit of choice in South Africa.
I had read bad reviews about Royal Air Maroc so I was pleasantly surprised The flight from Manchester to Accra via Casablanca was fine the food was good there was entertainment available if you had a device to link to their wifi and all of my luggage made it The security check at Casablanca was tense and chaotic but that is not the airlines fault. Definitely recommended
Cancun to Manchester on Thomson Airways B787 Dreamliner this aircraft should have been called the sardineliner. Forget all the hype they still shoe horn you in your seat and slap a nice review of how much legroom youve got. On takeoff in the window seats water drips down from a corrugated air channel above your head and you can actually see were people have stuffed paper towels into the vents. As for the mood lighting and bigger dimming windows I dont understand the hype. Inflight entertainment and free drinks but Thomson pale into insignificance compared to Virgin I hope I never have to fly on sardinliner ever again.
The worst ever bought a flight and got delayed 12 hours going back the same thing almost 10 hours. When i was in Newark they said they where late because of weather condition in Florida now Im in Florida and they are delay because of the weather in Newark. Then they tell you that airline traffic department wont allow them to land but they will need to cancel because now they dont have an airplane when people decides to cancel their trip 12 hours later they get an airplane I think they overbook or they put 2 flights into one.
Return flights from Newcastle to Geneva via London Heathrow in Club Europe. Check in at Newcastle rapid without a queue. Fast track worked well. Lounge was ok but limited selection of food. Onboard all flights the domestic and European biz class is fine. Seats with decent legroom choice of food chicken salad charcuterie and cheese and good quality drinks. The staff were lovely professional and good humoured despite having a lot of service to deliver on short sectors. Crew from GVALHR particularly good with a biz passenger who became unwell and needed medical attention on arrival. All of this during the Mixed Fleet strike dates. T5 South Lounge at LHR was like a sauna and access impossible from south security involves a long walk downstairs then up again. North lounge better on return but bathrooms generally dirty and in need of an update. Tagged priority bags were literally the last on the belt at Geneva which was a joke but likely not BAs fault. First off back in Newcastle. Overall the short haul business product is perfectly adequate if for nothing other than skipping queues. BAs lounges are pretty poor compared to some of their competitors but was very happy to see their crew still doing an excellent job.
Port Elizabeth to Durban with FlySafair. I would like to compliment your ground staff checkin staff who were on duty at PE airport at 14h30 on Friday 14th June. I had a really ill colleague travelling with me to Durban and requested if they could help me with assisted boarding as I hadnt requested that when the booking was made. Your staff were nothing less than accommodating and amazing in the way in which they took over and took care of her from checkin to her getting into the vehicle in Durban.
Took 2 flights which have left me in no doubt that I will never fly this airline again. Our first was Pereira to Santa Marta. At checkin my wifes regulation cabin bag was deemed too large by 5 cms would cost in excess of 20 to place in the hold. This bag has met the requirements of every other airline we have flown with and that is many. The assistant was at least ready to offer an option transfer all the contents the bag into our hold baggage as they were underweight. This we did not without some inconvenience embarrassment as our belongings spread across a very crowded restricted checkin floor. The second flight was from Cartagena to Bogota. This time prewarned about baggage we fell foul of another Viva rule. Travelling around Colombia it had not been possible to print our boarding passes the penalty 18 to have the checkin desk print them for us totally unsympathetic to our situation. So be warned if flying with Viva Air which we will certainly not be doing again.
New York to Shanghai in economy class. I flew during COVID19. I went with my baby twomonth old. Everything was so horrible. I will not say that much since it is a public review but it was so horrible. I would rate a minus for this flight worse flight that I have had JFKPVG COVID19
Kuala Lumpur to Berlin via London. Aircraft long haul new and clean short haul a bit old but still acceptable. Crew overall are lovely pleasant service. BA food is on the top of the rank. Kuala Lumpur to London My boyfriend and I got beef stew and chicken satay as dinner and beef omelette as breakfast. Also very tasty. We got 2 wines and so many juices. Return flight was chicken curry and pesto pasta. Again it flavorful. And we got beef congee and Engliah breakfast before we landed. Short hauls dont have any food. Inflight entertainment not the best but still acceptable. Short hauls dont have any screens. Only thing I dont like is the seats. Economy seats are small. I have no problem with it since I am a petite girl but still very uncomfortable to sit straight up. If I knew before I will book a premium economy that one seems nicer and have more space. I got the best price for round trip value for money
Perth to Doha. Had huge problems processing a Qmiles award upgrade from Business to First class. Took 6 weeks and 23 Support Tickets to resolve. Tried to call Was told that the support line can no longer work on award upgrades please use Website But the website was broken that could not do online. Situation was made worse when my wife was upgraded to First but I couldnt. Eventually the upgrade was processed but they used my Wifes Qmiles not mine. Another bunch of emails to resolve this. QR They have problems with the handling of your Qmiles. And you have a second bigger problem where your support staff flag SRs Support Requests as Resolved but do nothing.
Gatwick to Prague. They waived my overweight bags because I understood that I could take up to 23 kg without paying and I felt good that they trusted me and said that theyll waive my bags usually you can only take up to 15 kg free. My flight was delayed with two hours which is a common occurrence by SmartWings as I see in other reviews. But it was value for money as I only paid 52 pounds for the ticket same day that I actually am flying. We didnt yet fly and I hope all will end well.
SYDPVG then AMSPVG and PVGSYD three longhaul flights over Feb and March. Each flight left and arrived as scheduled and was a pleasant experience with friendly helpful cabin crew. Meal options 4 were each very tasty especially the Asian options and alcohol generously served throughout the flight. An assortment of selfserve snacks were available between meals. The lieflat beds were a little tight around the feet and the cabin a little warm for a perfect sleep on the three overnight flights but nevertheless a reasonable number of hours of Zs were achieved. If requested the crew will leave you asleep and not wake you for meals. IFE had a reasonable selection of recent release and an assortment of foreign films. Not the greatest in the world but OK for the average 10 hour sectors. The spoken English standard of the crew was variable but communication overall was not a problem either in the air or at checkin.
I made a booking from Bahrain to Istanbul on 9th April and return on 21st April 2022 on 3rd March and then 10th March I receive a mail saying the flights have be changed to 9th to 10th of April 2022. I had already made my hotels booking and paid for it which is non refundable and also for my rides in Istanbul. I spoke to the call centre they said there are no possible flights available on 9th so I had no choice. So I chose to travel on 10th April later I got a mail saying that my flight from Istanbul to Bahrain has been rescheduled for 2 hours in prior so I called and asked the call centre agent to change the tickets to 22nd April as I wanted to spend 12 days in Turkey he said there is no available flight on 22nd and he gave me an option that In case of rescheduling of flight I can choose any flight 7 days prior or 7 days later from the date of actually booking. So I chose on 23rd of April 2022 I said OK so he told me. He send me Confirmation of the ticket. But when I received the tickets it was given for 23rd March a month prior than the actual date of traveling I already lost lot of money for my hotels and rides because of you guys rescheduling the flight now I am waiting for the tickets to be given on 23rd of April from March. Its been one of worst experience for me. And some of your agents are really rude over phone while talking.
Dirty old aircraft extremely uncomfortable despite having an entire row to myself due to the seat design. Cabin crew friendly enough but did nothing to enforce covid regulations. I was seated opposite a customer with her unmasked nose on display and it remained like that for the rest of the flight. She wasnt the only one and cabin crew said nothing to anyone. They spent most of the flight hiding behind a curtain. The aircraft was also disgustingly dirty and had obviously been in this state for some time. Transavia also refuse to take cash which means you need to have a card they accept to buy any of their low quality overpriced refreshments. They also made some weird announcement about people not being able to take pictures or video onboard. Obviously an attempt to cover up their lack of cleanliness and safety.
Early flight from Gatwick to Dubrovnik. Check in reasonably quick although only one desk at business class check in. New fast track security was quick. Number One lounge was busy but we had a reasonable choice of seats refreshments OK. On boarding disappointed by the cleanliness of the cabin when lowering the tray table from the seat in front on both my seat 4C and my wife 4A they were very dirty nothing that could not be solved by a wet cloth but not good enough. Hot breakfast was OK. Cabin crew were very good. Flight landed on time into Dubrovnik but our bags were about the last through so priority clearly doesnt work. A bit disappointing really.
Paris to Mauritius. Rows of seats too narrow no legroom crammed together like in a cage. WiFi is only offered against payment. Unfriendly staff and not available for night flights. Must have slept by yourself. No food just something indefinable cold. You got a voucher to get yourself cold food in a shop at CDG airport and that on a flight of more than 11 hours. Not a normal continental breakfast but rather something indefinable. The only point of light the flight captain. Great flight and landing. Airline not recommended.
Amsterdam to Copenhagen. Arrived more than 2 hours before departure checked in went through security and waited in the lounge on November 7th. Shortly before boarding the gate was changed from D60 to M3. In the airport there are no signs to direct you to M3 and no staff could guide. To go from D60 to you M3 you have to exit through the baggage area and into an other terminal. Just saw the cabin door close when finally arriving at the new gate. Schiphol apparently shuffles low cost carriers around all over the airport in the last minute. Had to get a hotel for the night and buy an expensive lastminute SAS ticket to get home the following morning.
Tehran Damascus. Very poor from the start to the finish. Checking in the man was very poor in his manners. On the plane the service very poor food poor service poor. I could even smell the flight attendant smoking prior to take off since I was seated at the back of the plane. I was very disappointed with Syrianair.
Great flight for an intraeuropean flight from London Heathrow to Istanbul. Used the mobile app for check in and had hand baggage only so whizzed through terminal 2 at LHR. Refreshing to have a proper full service airline within Europe. Free hot meal and drink free IFE free baggage check in. Very comfortable seat with ample legroom. Flight was on time crew were friendly. Very satisfied.
Return flight to Bristol from Gothenberg 200318 pulled told incrementally 12 hours at a time of delays from midday until finally at 22.30 we were herded on to bus from gate to plane promptly back again. Continual stories told by Menzies staff no BMI staff at the airportthat planes were arriving from 3 airports. Told that the flight would change destination to Birmingham not Bristol then reversed. 2300 told no flight 2330 taken to overnight accommodation told we would fly 0600 Gothenburg Frankfurt. Arrived to find a 1 hour delay flew from Frankfurt to Bristol. Very poor communications rudeness from Menzies staff lack of kindness to elderly young babies stressed customers missing connectionsworktransport at destinations. Arrogant staff whose answer to angry customers was to call security rather than calm very patient but by then annoyed customers. Some meal vouchers eventually supplied were insufficient 6 euros for 2 of us Further vouchers given too late at night unusable the next day. Lack of clear comms via customer care line constantly engaged phone staff poorly trained no continuity no return calls when requested no records of complaintsclaims kept obscure signposting on website to complaints procedure still waiting 1505 for compensation.
Geneva to Taipei via Dubai. I dont recommend Emirates and I will avoid to fly with Emirates moving forward. The flight I took from Dubai to Taipei was delayed for more than 6 hours. I arrived Dubai around 1AM and departed at 10AM. During this period of longwaiting time Emirates didnt make up anything for us. There was no meal voucher no nothing. I wont rate its service as good as its reputation. It is pretty poor actually. Secondly during my whole itinerary I had to take shuttle for at least 4 times. It was either from flight to terminal or from terminal to flight. Its definitely not a pleasant experience because my wife and I had to wait in a jammed hot bus and the transit time was long. I travel average 810 times a year and fly various airlines worldwide. I have never experienced anything similar before with other airlines.
London Gatwick to Montego Bay. I normally fly with Virgin Atlantic to Jamaica but decided to try Thomson Airways as price is much cheaper. The plane was excellent for leg room. Food is very poor and could not eat it. I made sure I brought my own food on the way back home. Inflight entertainment was poor too. Complimentary drinks throughout the flight. Overall the flight was not too bad and I would fly with them again due to the fact that they are much cheaper than Virgin and BA I guess you get what you pay for.
Absolutely horrible experience with Sunwing Pearson to Punta Cana for an All Inclusive vacation. Avoid at all costs even if alternative airlines are more expensive. You will pay in other ways The lineup at Pearson for baggage dropoff is 2 hours online checkin absolutely no other kiosks had this amount of backlog. Frustrated customers. There are unnecessary checkpoints for travel documents which no other Canadian airline required. In Punta Cana there is an additional checkpoint to pay US20 Dominican exit tax Again a massive lineup and delay other airlines like WestJet include this tax in their fare no waiting. As other customers noted delays and carousel waittimes are unacceptable. 200 people crammed around the YYZ carousel for over 2 hours. If you are elderly or traveling with kids avoid this airline at all costs.
I recently had a truly terrible experience with them from Islamabad to Riyadh on June 17 2023. From start to finish it was filled with disaster and discomfort. The ordeal began with an unannounced 8hour delay during which the airline provided no facilities or support for the passengers. I tried visiting their office and calling the helpline to understand the reason for the delay but I was met with indifference and blame as if I should have known about it in advance. To add to the confusion when I checked the official website for updates it indicated that the flight was on time. However the flight did not appear on the airport screens for several hours. Finally it reappeared on the screen with misleading information that the delay was only one hour. Throughout this entire ordeal passengers including families with children were left scattered in the airport feeling helpless and hopeless. There were no refreshments meals or any facilities provided. It was a time of extreme inconvenience and trouble. When we approached the airline team at the boarding counter for confirmation their response was so bad. They informed us that the aircraft was currently loading passengers in Dubai and that the flights departure time would only be confirmed upon its arrival at Islamabad airport. This lack of clarity and professionalism caused further frustration. Eventually the flight was delayed for another hour. Despite the numerous challenges faced during the journey the flight attendants stood out for their attentive and helpful approach. This small act of responsiveness was truly commendable amidst an otherwise disappointing journey Based on my experience I will never fly with this airline. Even if it were the only option available I would opt for an alternative.
No food for my children on flight from LA to Philly. Ran out before they got to us could have at least served the young kids first if theyre not going carry enough for everyone.Ill drive to Newark or Baltimore before I fly US Airways again.
St Lucia to Gatwick with British Airways. We checked in on line and dropped the luggage off and were quickly through security. The lounge was small but quite comfortable with a nice lady serving drinks at the bar. I asked her if she could make me a Rum Punch and despite causing a small queue she happily made me an excellent cocktail. Boarding was well organised and the flight departed on time. On board we were extremely well looked staff were very professional and were able to find the time to chat and make my wife and I feel very comfortable. The wine choices were explained very well with the offer of tasting each bottle. Dinner was plentiful if not that exciting but the numerous glasses of wine helped to make it was an enjoyable experience. We landed on time and after a brief scare from the pilot who said that due to the French air traffic controllers strike there may be a delay in parking the plane we soon disembarked and were in the luggage hall within around 25 minutes. The luggage arrived quickly and we were soon on our way home. Overall a very good flight thanks in main to the excellent cabin crew.
Never again Flight out was delayed with no information. Food inedible staff unhelpful. The plane was dirty and tatty and very cramped. Turnaround time did not allow for aircraft to be cleaned and passengers rushed on board. We have a child in a wheelchair and it was very clear that we were holding things up. On the return journey only a half hour delay and slightly cleaner plane however they did not inform Gatwick that we would need our wheelchair brought to the aircraft from the hold so we had to wait on board for 40 mins after everyone else left. Again it was clear we were an inconvenience and one of the pilots went to the other end of the plane and had a smoke We were handed stale ham rolls no tea or coffee as our meal and there was very little duty free available.
I was travelling from Jeddah to London with a bag. I arrive 1 hour 30 minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed I tried my best but there was no staff to help me so I have to leave my bag as I was not allowed to take the bag on the plane. In London I made a complaint but they were saying that we cant do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about 1 hour and 47 minutes of wait
They Simply cancelled the flight. Which affects all my vacation plan. No proper response from the airline team. When I tried to change the date of they are asking for fresh payment.
I flew LHRYVR outwards 20th May 2014 on 747. The cabin newly fitted and no problems on return leg 10th June 2014 we were greeted with old style fittings. The whole cabin was very shabby and the seats were damaged and the TV set was unwatchable as the picture was so dark. Even the staff apologised for the state of the cabin and seats so if it is so bad why do BA sell these seats. I would be unlikely to book 1st class again with BA unless they would guarantee that the plane would have the updated seats and cabin.
I purchased a full package holiday to Egypt for December 2017 Birmingham to Hurghada and was offered at a cost for Thomas cook to obtain our visas. I agreed as I had no time to check and sort them. I received a document 4 weeks before saying I had a prepaid visa. I arrived at the airport excited to travel was allowed to check my bags and spend nearly 3 hours in the airport only to be to at boarding that I was being refused travel due to not have 6 months left on my passport. I showed my visa confirmation issued by their company but was still turned away. They are now taking no responsibility for anything and I am down 1300.
Manchester to Singapore via Dubai. We flew Emirates on each leg of our trip to Singapore. The first leg on Sunday 25th November 2018 Manchester Dubai was excellent the crew were attentive and very pleasant. The next leg DubaiSingapore was less pleasant the crew less attentive. The return flights 8th Decemberwere much more unpleasant the aircraft was full on both legs but that should not have had any bearing on the complete lack of interest that the crew displayed. On the first leg my wife felt as though she was about to vomit I went with her to the back of the plane and asked a member of the crew for some advice He was chatting to two other crew members at the time his response was to point to a toilet at the rear and said Sick bags in the restroom no other concern was expressed. The leg from Dubai to Manchester was over night leaving Dubai at 2.55am for at least three hours we saw no crew at all anything we needed had to be requested by a visit to the curtained off galley. Overall we were extremely disappointed by the standard of service far less than we expected. The uniforms of the crew are probably the smartest in the business but along with this must go an equivalent level of customer service. This was our first trip with Emirates but I expected far more from them than this. Good clean aircraft food only soso good timekeeping but oh dear The level of service fell far below what should be a standard.
World Traveller Plus from Beijing to London LHR. Old and tired 747400 these planes really should be pensioned off now. The cabin was freezing with everyone wrapped in blankets for the whole flight. Complaints to the cabin crew just got a sorry we have no control over the air temperature response. Veggie meal ordered was given to someone else by mistake so I had to have fish. Video screen is tiny on these planes not that it mattered as the system wasnt working properly so I couldnt watch any films. Pretty poor on a 9.5 hour flight. Sound system for communicating with passengers was very distorted so it was impossible to understand any announcements from flight deck or cabin crew apart from a little bit of extra leg room Ive no idea what extra money for World Travel Plus is supposed to be for.
London to Bangalore via Mumbai. The worst international flight I have ever boarded in my life. I flew with Jet Airways before also and was ok but this was horrible. LCD screen entertainment system is not working through out the flight. Food was pathetic and there was shortage of food and cabin crew where behaving very cheap manner. I will never fly with Jet again.
My daughter and I flew Lan Peru from LimaCuzcoLima in December 2004. Both great flights. Lots of leg room a lot more than on the Delta flights from Toronto to Lima. Its a 1hour flight and they served a hot breakfast Toronto to Atlanta is a 212 hour flight and we got pretzels on Delta. FAs were pleasant and helpful. Plenty of overhead baggage space and did I mention the leg room The only snag we had on the return flight was no vegetarian meals the meal for the 1hour flight was a hamcheese sandwich and a fruit cup. The FA apologized and explained that on domestic flights they dont have vegetarian meals the tour operator we booked with should have known that. The FA offered us the crews meal a salad we declined but I thought it was a very generous offer. I had brought granola bars for problems like that. Would I fly with them again most definitely unfortunately they dont fly to Toronto.
I purchased travel insurance when I bought the airline tickets and the tickets purchase was accepted but without my consent the insurance was taken out. When I then had to cancel my flight it was impossible to get a response from the airline. No one seemed to know anything and I was refunded less than half of the ticket price.
Both of my flights were completely packed as per the New Year peak season. Bangkok to Hong Kong sector was operated was a slightly older Boeing 777200 but with a refreshed cabin. Cabin crew was enthusiastic as per Cathays standards and exceeded my expectations for a 2hour flight. Since I havent experienced a regular Economy seat in a while now I normally book bulkhead seats I was shocked in a good way as to how much leg room there actually is. Its amazing how an extra inch of pitch can make a difference in flight. Hong Kong to Vancouver on a 1year old 777300ER and honestly it was my best experience of all the trips Ive made on this sector. I reckon the majority of the crew are Vancouverbased which I have noticed from the diversity of nationalities as well as more attentive service as a whole. Im not saying those of Hong Kongbased are inferior but I definitely find the latter tend to rush the service a little. With that being said this flight was excellent. FAs were responding to requests promptly also going out of their way to give more than expected. Pushback and taxiing at Hong Kong were early as the captain was trying to make up time for the surprisingly long flight time 11 hr 40 min compared to the usual 10 hr 30 min. Despite the early departure the flight was 30 minutes late into Vancouver none of which are Cathays fault as all flights from Asia were delayed coming in that day. Overall my best experience on Cathay so far and I look forward to using their service again in March.
My journey and trouble began at the departure airport when I was given a boarding pass for New York instead of Lisbon. Once I caught it my luggage had already been sent to the wrong aircraft. They had to manually get it and change it My luggage was damaged on a flight. I began the process of filling the paperwork and pictures when I returned to Canada Two weeks later. I didnt receive a response for 7 months when they asked me for the same info Id already sent. I resent the info and pictures. I received the same email requesting the info a month later and resent. Following 9 months of sending the info three times they then began sending emails saying Id requested the damage compensation too late and due to the Montreal convention It has to be within 7 days of the incident. I requested I hear from the manager and what was this policy only the receive the same email twice more. This airline should be ashamed of their customer service. I will never fly TAP again.
London Heathrow to Budapest. After so much disappointing experience with BA this was finally a nice flight. I got an emergency seat assigned at the online checkin though these are usually for extra money. On top of this no one sat next to me so I had better seat than the people in Euro Club Business class since their legroom is the same as on economy class. The flight departed and landed in time and was uneventful anyway.
Gatwick to Minsk. I had to change ticket and they charged 50 euro for per ticket but never gave me back the price difference. Its not only that I had sent them 4 emails but no reply from customer service. Very bad reputation. Avoid this airline by any cost.
Johannesburg to Durban. This is my first domestic flight in South Africa and I was positively impressed by Flysafair. Online booking was very clear and rapid. Even though I took a flexible ticket my flight was extremely cheap. Boarding was very efficient and started on time. Staff was nice throughout the flight and very professional. On both ways flight departed exactly on time and landed 15min ahead of time. Seating was ok Im 1m95 tall. The only criticism would be the plane that was relatively old 20 years.
Xian to London on 10th Feb 2020. Aircraft only 3.5 years old. Good amount seat recline with charger available however the entertainment system need an upgrade. It is the coronavirus outbreak at moment the crew did an excellent job measuring temperature and disinfected the aircraft. Excellent cabin service. I went back to spoke with cabin crew they are willing to share their stories and experiences. The lack of entertainment system is covered by the excellent crew service.
I normally fly with another airline but this time had to choose an option with LATAM for Bogota to Santiago return and Bogota to Cali one way route. Overall the service was acceptable but of a somewhat lower quality than the other airline. Firstly the planes are dated and started showing their age. The inflight entertainment system BOGSCL is not very reliable. The touchable screen does not work well while the entertainment system wired control is in the seat and any wrong body movement in the seat might cause its acting by itself. Besides there is no power outlet either. Since I am accustomed to use my flight time to work on this occasion I was disappointed that it was not possible because my computers battery died out quickly. On another note the staff is doing their work but as many other reviews here have noted it is rather cold and not exactly very smiley. Half of my flights had been delayed though apparently due to the weather issue or airport traffic beyond the airline control. Yet I almost missed my connection in Santiago because the luggage delivery was late while the airport international arriving area is small and crowded and there is a long line for customs. Only half the time the boarding is done by turns according to the rows of seats assigned when it is enforced is very convenient. What stands out however is the quality of food provided on the longer legs in economy quite tasty with metal and not plastic fork and knife used. Unlimited and good quality wine and other spirits. However there is not even a glass of water offered on the domestic Bogota to Cali flight. All in all I will try to fly with another airline next time since LATAM did not achieve to convince me to change my preferences.
Flew EVA Air from Heathrow to Bangkok. Fantastic. Departed on time they were organised with boarding etc. Plenty of legroom in economy pillows and blankets friendly cabin crew. Free eye masks toothbrushes and toothpaste in the loo which was a nice surprise as well. Food was nice with a choice of options. Will definitely fly with EVA again.
Dhaka to Helsinki via Doha. The overall flight experience was ok. But from Dhaka the flight was showing delay for technical issue then the connecting flight missed and changed to next connecting flight with 16 to 18 hours layover. Though they have very good hotel services with food transportation.
Food offerings at Seoul Asiana lounge rather poor the wing lounge at Hong Kong airport much better. Food ex Seoul was good ex HKK rather mediocre. Service seats and entertainment system excellent.
Windhoek to Manchester via Frankfurt. Provided service is very poor. For blankets you have to pay. There are no meal options. My friend is vegan and finished up hungry on 10h flight as there is no vegetarian option. They also have delayed departure by 24h. Have applied for compensation that belongs to me and no response after 1 month already. This airline does not take any responsibility.
Booked a last minute flight on a fifth freedom flight from Cathay Pacific between Bangkok and Singapore as they offered the cheapest tickets for me. I was not able to check in online and via check in counters received a seat with my girlfriend at one of the emergency exit which gave me tons of legroom but no window to watch. Flight departed slightly late. IFE screens available and a good tasting meal was served enroute. Luggage took a very longtime to appear.
Poor and unreasonable baggage rules. I chose their Premium Economy service this time and I got 2 x23 kg baggage quota. I got three bags need to check in and the overall weight is within the limit but CX was rejected and said only 2 bags are allowed. I dont understand why there is no flexibility to their customer. Finally I paid extra USD 60 for the extra checkin baggage and I havent experienced the same handling in other airlines. Other traditional airlines always accept extra baggage as long as the overall weight is within limit. Ground service is not helpful. It is my first time taking premium economy class and I dont see any premium service except extra legroom. Food choice is limited and no food or drink menu is provided. Poor service and overall experience.
Not impressed. The cabin crew lacked energy and enthusiasm. Poor service. There was also rubbish left in the pocket of the seat in front of me when I boarded the plane. There were food crumbs on the table when I unclipped it and the magazines looked well used. I expected more from British Airways. I wont be flying with them again.
My flight was from Toronto to Calgary. The airline misplaced my baggage its been more than 24hrs now. Came back to the airport with an uber necause they never gave me any tracking number on the yellow slip called more than 50 times. Zero help. A very terrible and bad experience for my first flight with this Airline and it will be the last time.
RGN to Mandalay. Airfare considerably less than other airline. Flight was on a new airbus. Checkin while chaotic went well. Lots of airport staff. Everything was done manually with paper and counters. Cabin crew well dressed and pleasant. Flight was comfortable and on time.
FrankfurtSplitFrankfurt. Old ashtrays but very comfortable A320 with the best legroom Ive had and soft seats. Only one third full adding to the comfort. Nice sandwich and whisked to Split in only 1 hr and 20 mins. Return flight same quality despite full flight. Quick boarding and departing thanks to small Split Airport. Crew not very friendly. All in all good value for money 150 euro rtn would definitely fly again.
Do not book Avelo They delayed our return flight from Tampa to Raleigh multiple times last night and then cancelled at 11.45pm minimal notifications regarding the cancelation and didnt offer a rescheduled flight or alternative route. They suggested we attempt to contact their customer service to rebook on another flight home within 7 days we called customer service multiple times and was on hold for over 45 minutes. Never got a hold of anyone. We ended up having to book a flight home with another airline. Avelo says we will be reimbursed within 710 days...will see. No offer to help with hotel accommodations or anything. Horrible customer service.
Dubai to New York JFK. Emirates lost both of my bags on Friday 14th July 2017. No one has bothered to contact me to give me any updates or even admit that the bags are lost and that they are trying to find them. No one has bothered to contact me to offer compensation for the missinglost bags. It has now been 4 days and I still am missing 1 bag which apparently they knew was missing on the 14th and sent it from Dubai. The call center has been less than helpful except for the lady that answered today. Basically it seems no one has any clue what is going on and this is really unacceptable. I have been the one chasing Emirates up not once have they called me to update me on the status of my missing bag.
Flight quite uneventful although the hard product on Boeing 777 needs to be refurbished it is outdated and worn. Crew were okay although they seemed very stressed and exhausted from servicing a bookedout 777 full of families and crying babies l on a 3hour flight and service felt very rushed and inattentive at times. SVO Terminal C is beautiful but crowded and full of bottlenecks resulting in long queues at security and long walking distances. The Malevich lounge though is excellent. It is wellplanned and has numerous comfortable seating with amazing tarmac views and despite being severely overcrowded it didnt feel like it. Overall an okay experience although much improvement is needed if Aeroflot wishes to achieve their ambitions of becoming a 5star airline.
Saint Petersburg to Minsk. So first hosts was good no problem about them. But in airport Belavia employees was really rude. Same week I had 2 more flights with Delta and Air France and did not have any problem like this. I will never flight with Belavia anymore.
Surprisingly good. First time with Eastern. Good checkin at NWI airport quite efficient and speedy except for the Norwich airport surprise tax Boarding on time nice friendly greeting on board. Good seating 1x2 I chose the single seat. Good legroom surprising good all round seat quite impressive for a small airline. Inflight good nice coffee and biscuits. A sandwich would have been nice but it was only a short flight. Cabin crew good and attentive. Good communications from cockpit and cabin crew. On time departure and early arrival. Nice to see a crew route around bumpy weather. Good all round experience.
Flew Philadelphia to the Maldives with a layover in Doha roundtrip in business class. The flights meant to be with QSuites but due to last minute equipment changes 3 of those flights did not have QSuites. Still the service food and seats were enjoyable. I was pleased the final flight from DOHPHL was equipped with Q Suites. Really nice product. However we boarded late sat on the plane for over 2 hours prior to takeoff due to a cargo issue. My flight attendant was forgetful and failed to bring half my meal the coffee or cheese plate I requested pajamas. The flight attendant on my husbands side was great though. Our bags never made it out of Doha. The agent promised my bag would be delivered to my home the following day. However the bag never showed up. I sent a message through Twitter and was directed to contact the baggage dept via WhatsApp. Still no response 28 hours later. I went back to Twitter and was then directed to contact baggage dept through the live chat which is a joke. 27 hours later and still no response. Back to Twitter and was told these things take time. So nobody will tell me where my luggage is how to submit for reimbursement cant get a response from any of the relevant channels cant speak to a live person.
Superb as always. We fly Ethiopian Airlines London to Addis at least twice a year. Would not dream of using another airline. Great planes great staff. Flying time now not much over 7 hrs on A350.
Checkin was fast MRS IST sector plane was spotless seats were comfortable and crew members were friendly. Flight took off on time and meal was served. Food quality and quantity was excellent two choices were given with plenty of drinks and good TurkishFrench wine selection. Crew member saw that I had plenty of leftover pasta sauce and he offered me 2 warm bread rolls very attentive. Landed in IST on time airport is gorgeous and huge. IST ISB sector was on time boarding went smooth and plane was again very clean and covidrelated regulations were respected. Washroom was clean. Food was excellent and drinks were offered twice. Everything went smooth. They probably offered coffee but i guess i might have missed that or maybe they didnt Still an excellent service.
Seoul to Hanoi. I wish to register my absolute disgust at the totally unacceptable service I received from Korean Air staff at Incheon Airport on September 1st 2017. I was told I have to line up and self check in which does not work it worked but not fully it recognized my Passport but would not allow me to check in as it could not verify my Visa. So I was asked to check in at a checkin desk. So back to the Line once more. This was now the 2nd Person from Korean Air I spoke with she told me must join this Line I explained the issue she told me this line this line I asked again this is for Hanoi yes join this line. So after 45 minutes I get to the initial entry Ropes of the Check in and am told wrong gate wrong gate I again tried to explain my concern and issue and was ushered away in a dismissive manner. I then asked another Staff member and still getting any assistance or good feeling whatsoever that I am going to successfully check in. I asked this lady sure this is the line for Hanoi if this is the line there is no way I can make the flight in time this is now the third line I have been told to join. Do not worry she said no issue you will make it. At 7.50 I have still not checked in and see no way in making my flight and I will not be able to make my appointment in Vietnam thru no fault of my own and what appears to be absolutely no concern from the Korean Air Staff on the Ground. I do not speak Korean so I am automatically dismissed. At 8.00am my Korean Colleagues who had none of the hassles I had as their passports were accepted without Visas spoke to one of the Korean Air Staff who escorted me to a check in desk and personally checked me in. I just made the Flight. I have never in all my years of travelling been so poorly treated. I am still waiting for a Reply from KE Customer Service to my email of Sept 7th 017
Miami to Toronto. It was our familys last day of vacation in Miami Beach and our rental car was broken into and our cash credit cards bank cards DLs iPads taken. The only saving grace was our passports were not taken. After hours of sorting things out with the Miami PD insurance and the bank we had 0 and still many hours to go before our flight. I thought wed be alright without any money until we got home. Then we went to the airport go to check in at the electronic kiosk which included our 1 check in bag which cost 22US I had forgotten about that cost. I went up spoke to the Air Canada rep and explained the situation. I offered to pay the following day if possible I made no progress with her so asked to speak with her supervisor. She went away and came back and passed along the following message from her supervisor. Her final answer Sorry there is just nothing we can do. You will just have to leave your suitcase here. You can just take your stuff out of the suitcase and wear what you can. I asked to speak with the supervisor and was told she was busy on the phone and while we waited for her to come out another passenger who overheard our situation offered to pay for our checked in luggage. These actions make a difference that you just cant explain such a thoughtful gesture from some really incredible people. I will be paying this forward tenfold.
Totally professional in every way Qatar Airways did not put a foot wrong throughout. Checkin at LHR were not in the slightest perturbed by the need to call Australia for authorisation due to the transit through Brisbane they took it all in their stride as if it was a completely normal action they had to perform all day long. On board the staff were all smartlydressed and carried out their duties in a calm professional manner. Their service was attentive and discreet not overbearing and intrusive. The food was excellent and far superior to my expectations. As a final bonus their fares were the lowest available for the route concerned. I would certainly fly with Qatar again in preference to a competing carrier.
We were supposed to fly out at 7 pm. At about 630 there were no employees at the desk. Our flight was still listed as on time. Another passenger found that the airline website listed the new departure time as 10 pm though nobody else was able to find it. We were never notified at any point by email or text. The scheduled time remained 7 pm and eventually the status was changed to 10 pm but the flight was never listed as delayed. At about 9 pm the poor staff member had to announce to everyone that the flight would not be taking off that night but at noon the next day because the pilot needed to rest. It took another hour for the airline to confirm a hotel for everyone and we all had to pay for transport with the promise of the airline reimbursing this eventually. Once they finally confirmed a hotel they did not even announce it we had to hear it from other customers. It was all very confusing. The lack of communication was the most frustrating thing. Today at 1115 our scheduled departure time is still 705 yesterday it was never listed as delayed.
CDGSEZCDG Business Class. We traveled on the only B767 with the new business class seats angled lie flat. These seats are a great improvement compared to previous Pearl Class seats. Outward flight on time inward flight with 1h delay due to late arrival of plane from CDG and slow boarding at SEZ due to passengers having to walk in heavy rains on the tarmac to reach jet. Food and wine soso. Nothing terrific but strangely enough on CDGSEZ meals were not at all what was shown on the menu staff apologized. Personal DVD players given for entertainment provided adequate offering of movies. Overall a decent experience in Business Class.
First time flying with Air Europa from New York to Las Palmas. I was surprised early on that the sinks in the bathrooms were not working at least 2 in the economy cabin. I understand for short haul flights but for such a long one to expect hand sanitizer is enough Usually with red eye flights to Europe at least what Ive experienced is that they try and serve quickly as possible to maximize sleep time but the crew certainly took their sweet time. Had a 4 hour layover in Madrid its quite a long walk from T2 to T1 so glad we had plenty of time. 1 out of the 2 bags checked in didnt make it to my final destination. When you pay double the price due to inflation as well as for bags youd expect slightly better customer service but there is no information at all whether it made it to Madrid in the first place or any information at all. Certainly does not care about the customer and will never fly again with this airline.
Melbourne to Sydney. Why does Tigerair still exist Always thought the bad reviews were over the top. Wrong Reviews are spot on. Flight TT254 was on time and we were at the gate lined up to get on the plane then the plane was delayed for an unknown reason and finally canceled. Magically the Sydney plane with the issue was now going to Adelaide and all the Sydney passengers had been transferred to later Virgin Australia flights. I just hope this was not Virgin Australia owner of Tigerair filling up their later flights to Sydney to save a dollar at the expense of their passengers
Los Angeles to Doha via London. Great staff poor food and stupid cabin layout. Im spoilt flying gulf airlines but this time I tried a rear facing internal 4 of 345 configuration. Firstly staring in the face of my two new best friends seats facing forward was at best weird and at worst like a business class speed dating experience. Crew could barely serve me ventilation was restricted and access 100 blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers. Once the security screens went up I felt like I was in some sort of flying crypt and was tempted to assume brace position to give the impression I had died and was on a viewing. The food was embarrassing bad bigger serves of economy style food in bigger economy style bowls. BA you have great crew trying to do their best with silly cabin engineering and poor catering support.
My flight with Blue Air got cancelled twice in 2 weeks. I got a cancellation notification I had to change my travel plans lost a lot of money on accommodation to find out 1 weeks later that my modified flight is cancelled again. They sell tickets cancelled the flights and operate with our money as its also impossible to get a refund or reach out to customer support. Extremely unreliable I cant believe something like this even exists. This really has to stop.
Rescheduled my flight at short notice. Sent an email saying the flight was rescheduled. Had a Flight Rescheduled Refund policy refused to refund the flight because according to them the flight was not rescheduled on their end.
Medellin to Cartagena. I bought the ticket online with an extra luggage. When I arrived at the check in they told me that my tripod cant travel in the cabin with me. So I had to pay extra for the tripod. Besides that since I didnt print the ticket they charge me more than 70.000 pesos. In total they got extra 111.000 pesos.
Fed up with Spirit Airlines. Im writing this review to remind myself never to fly them again. 4 flights out of 4 in the past two weeks either cancelled or delayed. Super hard to have Spirit help with rebooking. Voucher are limited to use only for new flights not for seats or luggage so I wont be using it. Meal voucher expired just awful. Never again Spirit air. You get what you pay for or less.
This was a short onehour flight. My original flight was delayed by an hour so I appreciated the option to opt for an earlier one at no charge. Here were the goods to this experience checkin was easy quick and no hassle and the A220 plane used was new and clean. The downside had to do with the boarding process as it wasnt smooth due to the apparent lack of any procedure and order to the process. Boarding by zones and elite status was not honored despite SkyTeam rules which KE is a founder. Also antithetical to a routine domestic flight onboard there was no beverage service offered likely due to some mild turbulence. In summary it was a good flight that got me there relatively on time for me to make my connecting flight. If the price is right Id fly them again.
Cebu to Siargao. Worst airlines I have experienced. First time our flight has been canceled and I dont see any returned money yet. Because of this we had to go to our destination through ship during 9 hours. The second time we were late only for 2 minutes and they didnt pass us to the plane so we had to buy new doublepriced tickets I dont recommend this airline
Kudos to the entire team I had a morning flight from Bagdogra to Kolkata. It was a short flight but I must say I had one of the best experience so far. Smooth and Comfortable A special mention of inflight attendants Anjita and Deepika they definitely deserve praise especially in time of COVID. The safety was well taken care of. They were extremely hospitable and at the same time professional. Keep up the good work
FLLCMH. the latest US startup airline that is embracing the very low costhigh restriction fare ala carte pricing for checked bags and everything for sale onboard model. My morning flight left Ft. Lauderdale on time and arrived in Columbus a few minutes early. I had checked in online and needed no assistance as i was not checking a bag. The friendly flight attendants offered a sales catalog after boarding and customers had a large selection of food and drink items as well as dutyfree type personal items jewelryperfumes also for sale. My return flight was delayed on landing and then reported a problem with the pilots radio which was a surprise given that the airline operates a brandnew fleet of narrow body Airbus. Finally after a delay of more than 4 hours we boarded another aircraft that had arrived late from another city and finally made it home by 215 a.m. On this flight all entree items were sold out and only snack items were available to eat. Customers were not offered any sort of compensation for the delayed flight just apologies from the airport and inflight crew.
SCLGRU and CWBSCLCWB. Having flown from Australia its always an exciting to travel on a foreign airline. Given that TAM do not fly to Australia this was a real treat I enjoyed every moment of the flight on a B777 on SCLGRU and taking away the GRU arrival issues the flight experience was great I think I would have had a harder time getting used to it had I not spoken my broken Portuguese they really appreciated it as did I The crew were professional the service expected and the IFE viewable. Domestic BRA flights are simple and easy.
By far the worst traveling experience I ever had. Flight was cancelled due to a mechanical issue of the airplane. Next available flight was set 8 hours later which was delayed one hour. We got 12 euros as a refund and that was all. I wouldnt suggest to fly with this company
Fly 10 or 12 times a year Mexico City to Ciudad Victoria. Planes are small Fokker Turboprops. Always very friendly staff and have been on time. Seats are rather small an excellent lounge with drinks and snacks at a number of airports. Service onboard with snacks and drinks are adequate.
London Heathrow to Brussels. I had to travel for a surgery that had to be done in Belgium. Going there the staff at checkin in were amazing as I had missed my plane she did everything possible for me to be on the next flight at a good price. However coming back to London the staff were quite rude and not acknowledging. I got on the plane and asked if I could have help to place my hand luggage into the locker as I could not carry anything nor lift my hand due to my operation. The first staff member at the entrance told me that I had to ask a member of staff closer to my seat if no one could help then he will try to come. So thats what I did but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasnt allowed to carry a bag unless I help her and even after explaining the situation she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcase. Luckily another passenger heard me and carried my bag to the top and helped my get it down at the end. I work in retail and I know about customer service but very disappointed with my expirience coming back especially on the plane. I am very angry by this situation and next time I will think twice before choosing the company again.
We have flown with Turkish Airlines from Antalya to Istanbul SAW on 19 May 2016. First of all the flight was punctual. Food includes sandwich and salad and desert but tastes good. There was no inflight entartainment. When we arrived to luggage claim the system that provides luggages has a problem we waited nearly 2030 minutes to get our luggage.
Awful service at airport. They had made a mistake with bag tag that was 100 the airlines fault they still would not help me had to wait in line for an hour. No service whatsoever I will avoid this airline at any cost in the future
Truly excellent experience with Lufthansa. Flight delayed over 2 hours due to storms in FRA and therefore all transfer passengers would definitely miss their connecting flights as we would land after 11pm. Despite this the crew were extremely friendly and helpful dealt with everybodys concerns calmly and professionally and even served free drinks in economy. Hats off to Lufthansa and the ground crew that then also took care of us all very well and with patience and good humour
New York to Hong Kong a very relaxing flight. Check in was a breeze though boarding was a crowded affair at a gate where space was cramped. Flight attendants were efficient courteous and warm. The angled lie flat herring boned patterned 121 seating offered ample space comfort and privacy I had a window seat. A huge collection of films. A fine collection of wines and spirits food menu mostly with a Chinese flavor. At the galley a spread of snacks. Hot towels were distributed several times during the flight and toilets were kept tidy. The amenities kit was basic and have not changed in years.
We arrived in San Juan Jan 8 2022 to discover that our Intercaribbean Flight to Tortola cancelled. We had called Intercaribbean Thursday Jan 7 and we told flight was a go no problems. We had received No communication from the airline. We attempted to call their customer service line but could not even leave a message as voicemail full. There was no Intercaribbean agent in San Juan or in Tortola. In fact we received more help from Cape Air agent and rebooked for Jan 9 am. Overnighting in San Juan and booking Cape Air flights has cost us an additional 1500. We have never received any communication from Intercaribbean. Do not fly on this airline.
I was concerned about this airline after reading many terrible reviews. My Air Tahiti Nui experience was the opposite and crew was friendly and very helpful. The leg room was better than most for economy. The food was ok. On each seat a blanket and pillow plus a bag with socks eye mask ear plugs ear phones which was a nice touch. They provided 2 meals and also offered food in the galley sandwiches drinks soup and ice cream nice selection of movies to watch also.
MUCTRN. Air Dolomiti has own check in gate area in MUC with Italian flair espresso etc. Bussing from gate to aircraft in MUC was quick. Hand baggage can be delivered to AC hold if not checked in. ATR42 or 72. Leather seats quite a lot of legroom. Small snack served on evening service choice of drinks. FAs english was good. On time arrival in TRN. If they flew regional jets flight time could be reduced against Turboprops. Inflight magazine was well presented. All in all a pleasant flight for a late evening.
Air Arabia is a good airline. The airport staff are helpful and always smiling. The aeroplane was in a clean condition. The inflight magazine is great and the dutyfree and SkyMeal magazine had plenty of options and the food was OK. The inflight entertainment is something Air Arabia must improve on. The pilots made PAs at regular intervals. The seat was comfortable and legroom was better than I had ever seen on a lowcost carrier. The overall experience was above average and according to the money paid there were more than enough services.
Kathmandu to Houston via Istanbul. I with my two little kids and old mother had a flight on November 2017. I had a layover of 19 hours so we were suppose to get hotel but because of being American passport we didnt get hotel. I didnt mind getting hotel but they gave me lot of trouble just to give little information about the visa. I was wondering from one counter to another counter just to get right information. Staffs at the airport were the rudest people I ever met. Even the visa officers at the counter didnt give me correct information instead they yelled and behaved in a very rude way. I couldnt get hotel because I and my kids had American passport and they dont issue visa from the airport to the American. My question to the Turkish Airlines is that why they didnt mention that while I brought the ticket why they issued ticket to the American passport I went to Turkish Airlines counter may be four time finally I got the correct answer. Staffs at the Turkish Airlines counter were also very very rude just as other staff at the airport. I ended up paying 300 at airport hotel. I will never travel with Turkish Airlines again.
My flight from London to Singapore in premium economy was the worst I have experienced. The seat was uncomfortable the flight tracker failed after two hours the breakfast prior to arrival in Singapore scrambled egg was like rubber. They ran out of cups and so my wife and I had no coffee tea or drink with our breakfast. I used the call button to get some attention and no one came to answer my call even after waiting more than 30 minutes. Eventually I made contact with a passing cabin crew member and advised that we had not had a drink and was told that they would come back. I never saw the crew member again.
I had to go to Doha for business and of course I chose Qatar Airways and it was such a great experience. First of all when I arrived to the Qatar Airways point to get my ticket staff were nice and helpful answering all my doubts. Then onboard the airplane the cabin crew were nice offering different snacks and beverages. I used the inflight entertainment offered and the flight went by quickly. The only thing I think they could improve was the wifi I never got connected.
Flew to Alderney from Southampton. A very pleasant short flight friendly captain. Aircraft is too small for safety demonstrations so you have to watch a short film in the departure lounge. My partner left his passport and mobile onboard and they phoned us a few hours later to inform us they would be ready for collection on our return flight. As the aircraft is very small it is not at all comfortable but a good inflight magazine. Cost of the flights was high considering the short journey time.
Plane was over an hour late leaving no problem that can happen. But on arrival at Heathrow the plane sits on the runway for 45 minutes as there was no free stand to go to. Then once at the stand we waited another 45 minutes as there was no bridge available to enable us to get off the plane. Just pathetically inefficient.
Asked to change to aisle seat denied at ticket counter and on plane even though they had several open available. When I booked ticket I didnt know or see wHere I wanted to purchase meals I thought meals were included. I said I would pay and I had to wait over an hour till they accommodated other passengers. Then I could buy only certain and few items.
Hong Kong to Sydney. Final leg of a trip from the UK. The previous three sectors were on BA metal and this on Cathay. It was on an A330 300 which is one of my favourite aircraft. Reasonably quiet easy to get on and off and very comfortable to ride in. CX has always had a good product on both the hard aircraft side and then the soft skills. Typically Asian service efficient and with a smile. The IFE was good with plenty of choice for a mid haul of 9 hours. I declined the breakfast service congee fruit or eggs as 4 am is a bit rich and early for my palate. The fact that there was little to say about this leg is a testament to the CX product.
No entertainment. The only entertainment was through a in flight online service which is accessed through your own device. The service was not working for the whole flight. With a one year old child makes a 8 hour flight difficult. Lack of in flight service. To finish it off they damaged our bag. I tried to speak to them about it but they gave me a card to contact them on. Now back in the UKand dont want to call at fear of further cost and their online complaint proceeded not working. So Im stuck with no help.
Frankfurt to New York everything was organized and on both way aircraft was spotlessly clean. A380 configuration offers privacy even in economy class by dividing the cabin into sections. I would recommend the upper deck because of seat density and less engine noise. The legspace is okay but then I am a tall person. The cabin crew were excellent and the food served was of good quality though I believe they should make the main course portions larger as EK does. Nothing was too much trouble for cabin staff and they made flight a pleasant experience by looking well after us. This flight reiterated my belief that SIA is the best
Hong Kong to Wuhan with Cathay Dragon. The food and wine is great The seat is very comfortable. Though its a very short flight the seat allows you to lay down as much as possible. Cabin crew are friendly.
Appalling customer service from Emirates. All good from London to Dubai but then we were told we were not booked on the flight from Dubai to Brisbane as it was over booked and they needed someone to take another flight. We had booked this flight and our seats 6 months before. So after an hour arguing with them we were permitted to fly but were given alternative seats next to the kitchen. Subsequently we could not sleep because of the noise plus my entertainment system was dead. I complained 3 times and was told they would reboot it but it never happened. So on my return I contacted customer service and was informed my it would take 30 days to look into my complaint. Here we are 52 days later and not another word. All in all very poor and disappointing service from Emirates.
Abu Dhabi to Mahe. Worst service we have ever encountered. We booked a vegan meal by email and received confirmation for both flights return. On the first flight we were told that they had no food for us as in they never received any food that is meant to be for us in the first place. On the second trip back we double checked with check in staff about our meals and they said there was nothing mentioned next to our names on the system we then asked them to add it again and they did while we were standing. Again on the plane we were told our names were not on the list to begin with so no food for us one more time. Food aside we were moved to from an 8pm flight to 10pm flight without prior notice. Also we knew other groups that were boarding the same flight as us by they were not shifted but they kept them on their same flight. Initially we were told it was due to system error and all 8pm passengers were shifted to 10 pm but if that was the case then how come we were the ONLY ones shifted Will never ever fly again. Also many people in the airport were complaining about having their flights being shifted TWICE Avoid this service.
Give this airline a miss at least in this route. I flew 3 budget airlines on this trip others were Thai Smiles and Vietjet. Both were far superior on everything from check in to leaving on time currently 5 hours past boarding time on this flight to quality of food to keeping passengers updated. Only fly as a last resort.
TLVJFK. I flew El Al on the way to Tel Aviv and had a decent flight. coming back on Israir I did not know what to expect. By far the most cramped plane I have ever seen. I am very tall and sitting in my seat my knees were jammed in the seat in front of me. Seeing that this was going to be twelve hours of sheer hell I asked for a seat in an exit row and was surprised to get one. Besides the flight attendant who granted my seat request change the rest of the flight attendants were some of the rudest I have ever seen. One pushed me aside to get past me in the aisle and I witnessed others screaming at passengers for no apparent reason. The food was barely tolerable pasta had a weird filling that may or may not have been meat or chicken. I do not know or do not wish to know one bite was enough. To dull the pain of the flight the red wine provided was decent to allow me to sleep for the majority of the flight. I recommend paying the difference if there is one to fly on ElAL or Continental and be treated with a little dignity and have just a tad of comfort on the flight
Things could not have been smoother really flying from Dubai to Jeddah. The flight was almost full but boarding on this double decker plane was done very well. I was lucky to grab the bulkhead seat so had a huge amount of space in front of my legs. Flight departed on time and breakfast was served as choice of cheese omelette or Arabic option. I chose the former and was not disappointed at all. For once the service was very good without any crew attitude issues as has been seen so often with Emirates. There was free wifi as well. We landed on time and disembarkation for this huge plane was done smoothly without any airbridges in miserable Jeddah airport.
Absolute sham of an airline. They offer me an upgrade to Business class I paid 3100 they took my money and then I ended up in Main Class I spoke to them and they stated that it was a system error and they would refund me that was over 7 days ago and still no refund so going to have to make a claim with my Credit card. Awful to deal with you keep getting fobbed off Im convinced they lie to you or make things up just to get you off the phone. Ive also noticed that there a Facebook page set up for disgruntled customers who have also been scammed by the Business class upgrade offer. Stay clear of these cowboys.
I purchased 4 flights for my family three months before our holiday. Norwegian changed two of the flight times and instead of offering a refund are charging a premium to adjust my tickets to an alternate flight. I have had to rebook 10 tickets and pay twice now for each of the flights as Norwegian dont take responsibility for changing flight times if its 60 mins or less. I dont understand why they need to be adjusting flight times 3 months out and I dont understand why they cant refund my tickets 3 months out.
I flew Turkish Airlines from Bodrum to Istanbul on April 18th 2016. The food and refreshments were excellent and service was good. The staff were helpful and the overall flight was satisfactory. Thanking Turkish Airlines and looking forward to travelling again in the future with you.
I prebooked my seats for both flights but we were informed that our prebooked seats for our flight from Istanbul to Heathrow had been allocated to someone else and that the flight had been overbooked and that there may be no seats for us on the flight. However there was no clear explanations or communications and were left waiting at a check in desk with a 7 year old sitting on floors whilst the check in staff and supervisors desperately tried to resolve the situation. I must say the staff all tried their best however there was a lack of communication nobody really knew what was happening and nobody could explain anything to us. Eventually with around 40 minutes until our flight took off we were handed boarding passes with the seat numbers left blank told to board our flight to Istanbul and once we arrived at Istanbul we would have 3 options which were There would be seats available and allocated to us or There would not be seats available in which case we would be put on the next available flight and compensated Or there would not be seats available if the next available flight was not until the next day we would be compensated and accommodated in a hotel overnight. We were then told that our flight from Izmir was delayed. When we landed at Istanbul we had to run to the International transfers and by the time we arrived there I saw I had received a text message that my flight had changed to a flight the next day which would have been sent before we had even landed. At the desk we were informed that seats were found for us on the original flight however we had missed the flight due to the delayed flight from Izmir. I know that the flight to Heathrow was delayed and was still on the ground and boarding at the time and we were told in Izmir that the only seat available on the flight was 1 seat in business class. We were automatically changed onto a flight at 1450 on 27th August. The seats we were given were 6B 6C and 13A which meant my daughter couldnt have a window seat and my husband had to spend the flight separated from us. We were then directed to the Turkish Airlines Hotel desk to arrange for overnight accommodation. When we finally reached the desk we then had to wait a further hour or so before we were transported to our accommodation. During which time my daughter was now hungry and tired. I had no choice but to buy food for her. We were then transported to the Ibis Istanbul airport and on arrival all I can describe the scene as is carnage. There was no method no order nothing just names randomly called out. The time now was past 10pm. By the time we were allocated a room and were able to get food it was gone 11pm. The next day we were given breakfast at the hotel however had to buy lunch. To date Turkish airlines have refused to accept responsibility and even acknowledge the overbooking of the flight and the forced bumping of our seats. They are refusing to pay us compensation for the delay or the bumping of our seats and continuously give different excuses to validate the delay to avoid paying compensation. Absolutely disgraceful customer service from Turkish airlines.
Boston to Copenhagen via Dusseldorf. Excellent outbound flight with efficient and personal service by cabine crew. Seamless transfer in Dusseldorf. Return flight with same route. Delayed departure but on time arrival. Outstanding purser but desinterested and demotivated cabin crew at least mine. Counterpart had to check all passengers in biz class while the one assigned to me sat in one of the passengers seats for the last part of the flight. Overall I would recommend this business class good service with reasonable prices.
I enjoyed my 18 hour flight from beginning to the end. Excellent service on board. Flight on time. Very comfortable seat. For me best the European airline first choice for my trips.
Seoul Incheon to Hong Kong. Seats was big long haul seats in regional routes. Meals well served with desserts and appetiser in this 3 hour flight with ice cream and seasonal fruits. Cabin crew was nice and friendly. However the entertainment system was quite outdated.
SydneyGriffith return. Comfortable trip although the Flight Attendant was very grumpy going to Griffith. Refreshment was a glass of water and packet of savoury nibbles. The return flight was equally comfortable although we were treated to an aerial tour of Sydney courtesy of ATC and the only airport in Australia that qualifies for Third World Status.
I cant ever recall a more incompetent airline. TAM Airlines made changes to our reservation and I needed to organise a flight change that suited our schedule. I called the toll free number in the US to do this and reached a TAMLAN service centre. Remarkably they told me that the representative works for LAN not TAM and that there is nobody available that can speak English to handle the matter. I then called Brasil to resolve the problem and I did get an agent who speaks English however the agent has no authority to change tickets she works for LAN and is based in Colombia and she created a case number and told me someone from TAM would call me within six hours. No phone call received within three weeks. Also worth mentioning I am Oneworld Emerald which of course makes no difference to anyone in TAM. This airline does not deserve to be in Oneworld. No question every new booking in Brasil will be with Azul which is easy comfortable user friendly and is the jetBlue of Brasil.
Frankfurt to Windhoek. I was surprised by Air Namibia. The airline offered a super service and you could watch many movies the service of the cabin crew was great the stewardesses have skilful English and German which helped. Generally a very good airline for the budget.
British Airways business class Heathrow to Accra as the BBC reported The most delayafflicted route. 85 out of 122 or 70 of flights on this route were delayed by over 30 minutes last summer. As a regular on this route I can verify these unacceptable delays. Indeed my flight the delay was as usual over an hour. The Club World product is now very tired and worn no updates to it despite the constant updates by other carriers. The BA crew were fine but not given good enough product tools to outshine other airlines. Usual chaotic boarding process for this flight the airlines knows it will have issues with hand luggage but always board the plane with only thirty minutes to departure. It will never work on this routing. When will BA learn The seating in the usual BA format for business class is just not keeping up with other airlines including One World members like Qatar American or Royal Jordanian. The constant having to lower the divider between seats to serve is both rude and poor service. The comfort is now more akin to Ethiopian Airlines on their older aircraft rather than that expected of BA. The LHRACCLHR route is a money maker for BA they use their old and tired aircraft on the route and milk it for all it is worth. Air France and KLM probably offer a better business class service on this route. A great shame to see one of the previously great airlines go down and down in standard.
Our flight was cancelled which we did not know about until we got to the airport early hours of the morning. We had been contacted via email the previous night while we were sleeping. Although it was heart breaking to miss a whole day of being in Australia since we were only going for the weekend for a wedding. We were grateful that we were able to be scheduled on a night flight via JetStar the same day. However this review is to provide feedback on the staff that was on duty to provide other options for us customers whose flight were delayed that morning. It was a long que and everyone were waiting patiently despite the lack of sleep and change of plans. It was disappointing to view that the staff kept on cutting corners in serving his own people in which we witnessed a total of three not travelling together before we got served. None of these customers stood in the que and walked straight to the desk and chatted with the staff in their own language. Fed up another had walked to the counter just when we got there and one of us told him to go to the back of the line in which the staff stated that we needed to calm down and threatened us with calling security. We left it as it is because we were desperate to get on a flight that day as we did not want to miss the wedding altogether. Hopefully staff gets taught about fairness and it is not about cutting corners with your own people.
Stockholm to Moscow return. Checkin at Stockholm airport quick with very friendly staff boarding fast crew very friendly and polite aircraft very clean with nice seats entertainment system has a lot of choice with new movies. Amount of food was not much but enough for this short flight. We arrived one hour late at Moscow Domodedevo airport due to a technical problem on the previous flight. I would definitely recommend flying with Singapore Airlines and I think that this is the best carrier.
Astana to Almaty. After A friendly check in with check in luggage allowance without any supplemental charge I proceeded to the gate. This aircraft was quite old the interior a little worn but OK for the short flight. Sweets were offered before take off then inflight a nice sandwich with nonalcoholic beverages and finally tea and coffee. Before landing again sweets. The crew handled the service professionally but in a non smiling manner. For the price paid this airline offers good value for money and to a level that low cost carriers in Europe do not reach.
Delhi from Ahmedabad with one hour Stop in Mumbai. Suddenly we came to know that Mumbai Delhi Flight 9W 346 of 7.30 am got cancelled from Mumbai to Delhi. The new flight boarding pass has been given was of 8.45 pm. Which means we 11 passengers from Ahmedabad has to wait in airport for almost 12 hrs. No support rude replies from staff of Jet Airways. We 11 passengers waiting from 7.am in Mumbai Airport and not sure if our new flight of which they have alloted boarding pass will fly at 8.45 pm. How can a Connecting Aircraft got 12 hours late and still No facility and no regret of Jet Airways staff.
Trinidad to Barbados. I was planning a long weekend with friends in Trinidad. I live mostly in Barbados but also in London UK. Id been umming and aahhing between LIAT and Caribbean Airlines and I checked out the reviews for LIAT which are definitely not good. I regularly fly between Barbados and Jamaica via Caribbean Airlines which involves a stoptransit through Trinidad and my transit experiences have not been good. Delays cancellations etc. One time arriving in Barbados at around 3.00a.m. instead of the scheduled 9.45m and anyone who knows Piarco airport would agree that it has to be the most soulless airport ever no information is given few places to eat get a coffee etc. Piarco departure lounge is BRUTAL. In the end I decided on Caribbean Airlines for my outward bound flight and LIAT for my return. I rationalised that if the CA flight due to depart at around 8.45 was late I could spend hours there whereas if I took the afternoon LIAT fight even with cancellations that I stood a reasonably good chance of arriving in Barbados before midnight. As it happens luck seemed to have been on my side. LIAT reviews are full of tales of delays cancellations rude staff wtc. Im happy to say that this was not my experience. The flight departed 5 minutes later than its scheduled 2.35 pm time slot which in aviationairline term is not at all late and got me into Barbados within the hour. All staff were pleasant and helpful as needed. We were served a beverage which CA did not offer on the outward bound journey. Flight was pleasant seats were reasonably comfortable pilotcaptain kept us informed and I really liked their inflight magazine. Overall I was very pleasantly surprised because as I said LIAT has very poor reviews and everyone that I had consulted prior to booking had warned me off LIAT. As I say I may just have been very fortunate but for this flight at least everything went well and if LIAT could maintain this standard I would happily fly LIAT again even though Im a confirmed CA fan
This airline is a mess I called days prior to our flight to ask questions about baggage and what was allowed and what wasnt. I was warned to expect to lose our baggage. We arrived to the airport on the day of and everything seemed to go smoothly. All the staff on the flight and the flight itself was exceptional However when we arrived to our destination one of our bags were lost. 2 days later it arrived. We were told we would be called but no one called. They just delivered it to the address we provided at the airport. On our return flight everything went smoothly at the airport and in the flight again all the flight attendants and the flight itself was great however was delayed slightly . When arriving to our home destination we picked up out bags and car seat. Noticed slight damage to one of the bags and the car seat for my child. Unfortunately we didnt do a thorough check at the airport. Our car was waiting and we were in a hurry as our flight was delayed by 40 minutes. When I went to put the car seat in the car the car seat was all taken apart. I had to take the time to secure it and put it back together in order to use it. Then when we got home we noticed the other bag was all ripped at the pocket. Ive tried getting in contact with them and no one answers the phone. No one seems to know anything about anything literally. Its been nothing but chaos. Their customer service is atrocious outside of the flight itself.
We flew the A380 from LAXLHRJNBLHRLAX in August 2014 in business class. This plane was designed by someone who never flew it. The seats are so close together with no room on the window side to get out when the seats are flat. A person has to put up the foot rest for a place to stand and then step over the person next to them to get out into the aisle. In addition the person on the window seat gets all the food handed to them in front of the face of the person on the aisle. They have put so many people in each row that the seats are very narrow. There is virtually no place a small drawer at the seat for personal items to be used during the flight without getting out of the seat to get something from the overhead.
They need to stick to flight and gate times. Arriving early is not safe and forces passengers to sit on runways and wait for gates. leg one We went from early arrival to leaving late as the airport tried to accommodate the unplanned adjustment. Sadly leg 2 we arrived late back in Edmonton then had to sit and wait for another plane to leave our gate... more schedule change adjustments. Very disappointing experience on both flights home. The flight there was much the same delayed x2 then ridiculous experience in Toronto as we remained on the plane for a extremely long quick turn add 3 hours of crazy experiences to your flights both directions. This airline definitely needs operational improvements.
Los Angeles to Johannesburg with a long layover in Doha. The seats assigned seemed to be entirely random no effort was made to keep us together preference for window or aisle were largely ignored. My seat gave average legroom and width. The arms of the seat on the Boeing 777LR only go up about 34 of the way making it extremely difficult to get out of the row especially when the seat in front is reclined. If there are empty seats you cant lie down unless you can fit under the partially extended arms. We had a 15 hour flight from Doha we departed about 8am from Doha an average breakfast was served at 9am we received a bag of chips about 5 hours later. They came around with drinks several times and our choice was a juice or water drinks were served at room temperature no ice was provided. After 8 hours from breakfast they served us a small chicken or vegetarian pasty with a small brownie a fuller selection of drinks was offered no ice unless you asked. After 6 hours with no snacks they offered a dinner. I thought the food service was meager and food quality was average snacks were nearly non existent. Drink choices during the flight were minimal the lack of ice was disappointing. I picked Qatar Airways because I read many glowing reviews about extra service and space but found the flight in economy very average. The entertainment options were very good but my remote on the trip to Johannesburg did not work properly on the return trip the remote would not stay in place and hung down on the back of the seat. On the 8 hour flight to Johannesburg they offered after departure and a small pastry after 7 hours no other snacks were offered. There are 4 bathrooms on the Boeing 777 in economy and nearly a constant line of people waiting to use them. We ran out of hand towels on my flight after about 5 hours. I was underwhelmed by the service economy I would rate as average. If you are flying economy take some snacks and adjust your expectation to average service.
Singapore to Seoul return. I will never take Korean Air anymore. Departing from Singapore there was no issue. But when I want to return to from Incheon Airport their ground staff was rude. I reached airport 3 hour before departing when I would like to enter to the queue for checkin boarding pass the ground staff was asking what passport are we holding if its not Singapore Passport should go for self checkin machine. We tried the selfcheckin machine before but failed due to first name family name on the ticket not exactly as per passport and the ground staff refer us to another queue for help desk. But when turn to me the help desk guy doesnt want to help and refer me to back to the first counter which is priority for SG Passport. When I questioned why he cant help his answer is those Korean queue behind of me might have urgent matter than me so he should assist them first This is principle of queuing Even through he assist to get my boarding pass done at the end this is worst memory and I will never take this airline anymore.
They damaged a brand new bag I checked in at Kahului and I cannot use the telescopic handle any more. When I pointed this out to their representative Val at Seattle Airport he told me I wasnt entitled to any compensation. After an overnight flight I was too tired to push my case and accepted what he said. But when I arrived at my hotel and emptied the bag to check the mechanism I discovered the mechanism at the bottom of the suitcase bent which has now jammed the handle making it useless. This is obviously from damage from poor handling. Their web site freezes regularly and there is no way to even send them a message to claim compensation or take this matter further. Having flown Hawaiian Airlines to many islands in Hawaii and enjoying the warm and genuine friendly and cheerful staff on Hawaiian it was a stark contrast traveling with Alaska Airlines for the first time. Whereas the flight attendants on Hawaiian greet every passenger when boarding my wife and I noticed that he Flight Attendants on Alsaka were too busy talking to each other when we boarded to even greet us Service on board was also very indifferent and you got the feeling they were just going through the motions until the aircraft got to its destination. Disappointing first experience and maybe no more
Short one hour flights with Safarilink to Diani from Nairobi Wilson return. A very pleasant way to reach the coast from Nairobi and much quicker overall than the JKIA Nairobi Airport to Mombasa route. Drink and biscuit served. Both airports were small indeed Diani is described as an airstrip.
I flew to Kangerlussuaq A330 a couple days later to Nuuk Dash7 then Ilulissat KangerlussuaqCopenhagen Dash7 A330. The flights were pleasant on time and meals onboard were delicious Greenlandic products fish shrimp. Considering Air Greenland has more or less a monopoly on travel toin Greenland the service was excellent. On the KangerlussuaqNuuk leg we turned back 3 minutes before landing in Nuuk due to sudden fog upon landing in Kangerlussuaq we were given lunch vouchers worth 100 DKK and clear information on when we could attempt to fly again. Visitors must keep in mind that weather is very erratic and unpredicatable in Greenland so you need to factor possible delays not under the control of the airline. The safety card in the seat pocket had interesting information on how to use the seat upholstery to keep your feet warm in case of an emergency landing in arctic weather most unusual
We flew business class on Nov 23 from Dulles to Panama City Panama. It was an old plane but the seats were well maintained and serviceable. However there were no 110V outlets and no screen or port access to video or music programs. Cabin service was minimal in business class. We were not offered a drink even water until over 1 hr into the flight when breakfast was served. The breakfast was adequate but several hours later there was no snack or other food provided. No alcoholic drinks were offered. After breakfast we had to go to the galley to ask for a cup of coffee or water. The bathroom was in business class with miniscule with no room to turn around. Overall it was at best a main cabin experience at business class prices on a long international flight.
Sydney to Cairns. Just before boarding flight got cancellation notification due to engineering failure all they mentioned is they will refund money. Will never travel Tigerair Australia again and will definitely recommend friends not to travel with them.
Absolute garbage. Boarded the plane only to be told to get off Cancelled our flight and didnt even inform us refused to talk to customers at the kiosk then informs us that they cant get us to our final destination of San Francisco one of the larges cities on the West Coast until 36hrs after we are supposed to arrive. Lost ABB lost car reservation with car seat that they arent going refund us for and now were have to make up 2 days of travel hurrying to a wedding in Oregon losing the time we were gonna spend driving the PCH which is half of our trip. Please for the love of God choose a different airline.
The convenience of using New York Stewart was greatly appreciated. Both outbound and inbound flights were on time. The crew was professional and the cabin service was good. Getting an exit row seat on the return was an additional bonus for my 64 frame.
A dysfunctional website and app that doesnt allow ticket change or booking a special meal. It leads to errors all the time. No technical support. No one answering the phone after hours of waiting and dozens of attempts. Therefore no possibilities to change my ticket or do with an agent what I cant do online. No warnings about anything no one telling you anything. The worst airline I ever flew with.
Zurich to London City. Average short haul flight experience. Easy and smooth morning flight to London. Cabin was narrow but ok although not very clean. The business class was half empty and the cabin crew was sometimes friendly but most of the time enjoying themselves while chatting to each other. BA served hot food on this short flight it looked not good and it was not good. Otherwise nothing special.
Lyon to Munich. Plane cabin was fairly new with enough legroom. Cabin staff was gentle and they offered possibility to get some snacks and drinks. Good service for short route. Only seat comfort can be enhanced.
I have flow on BA several times since the airline started nonstop service between Austin TX and London Heathrow. Every year the service gets worse. I brought a tape measure with me to see how far apart the seats are in the economy section. 2512 inches. BA has removed bathrooms in order to squeeze a few more rows of seats onto the aircraft. Thankfully Im not a big person and was able to squeeze into my seat without being too uncomfortable. When BA first started flying out of Austin the food was great. Now when I arrive at Heathrow I get real food and take it on the plane with me. I dont know where or who makes BAs food but it is not eatable. If BA did not have a direct flight from my hometown to London I would fly with a different airline. When we checked into Heathrow the line was extremely long and only one person was checking people in. It took nearly an hour to get to the counter. I understand airlines are making record profits and need to make up lost revenue from the pandemic but I think BA has gone too far and has little concern for customer service in pursuit of profits.
Worst experience ever. The policies of this airline are absurd and their actions make no sense. Get ready for delays and misunderstandings if booking with them. Fast lane priority boarding etc is just a scam its nonexistent literally theyre just stealing your money. In my flight ticket priority bag handling was also included however my suitcase arrived belated and also broken. Their customer service is non existent as well i would send them emails and messages which they never replied to. On instagram they would read my message and never reply as well.
Shanghai Pudong to Seoul Incheon. I arrived at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and proceed to Asiana Airlines counter for check in. The queue was relatively short and the check in process was prompt. Upon check in I was informed that OZ 364 which was originally schedule for departure at 1310 was delayed until 1600 due to bad weather in Seoul. I was given a generous meal voucher of 90 Chinese yuan to have my lunch at the airport. After lunch I proceed to with the security and immigration process. As a result of unforeseen circumstances I had plenty of time at the airport. Upon reaching the assigned gate the ground staff told me that the aircraft was further delayed until 1850 due to heavy rain in Seoul Incheon. A new gate has been re assigned for this flight. When I reached the said gate ground staff were seen busy assisting passengers while distribute meal box to fill our hunger and quench thirst. At the same time they apologised for such delay. Boarding announcement was called around 1830 as soon as the aircraft arrived in Shanghai Pudong International Airport. A bus was used to transfer us to the aircraft was it was parked at the remote parking slot. Boarding was relatively swift. The cabin crew and captain made an apology while awaiting for the taxi clearance from the airport control tower. In flight dinner and beverages were promptly served approximately 20 minutes after take off. Asiana Airlines cabin crew are well trained to handle our request. The standard of the in flight catering was fine but can be further improved. What truly impressed me was the hospitality and attention given by the flight attendant through out the entire journey. I shall certainly fly Asiana Airlines again in the future.
I travel a lot throughout USA and used multiple airlines. This was the first time using Spirit and guess what they surprised me with their eagerness to pocket your money. I always travel with one small luggage and a computer backpack. Nobody charged for 2 piece of luggage. These guys charged me 99 with a big smile on their face.
This was my first time with Blue Panorama. Travelled in July from Milan Malpensa Airport and after a smooth flight landed on time in La Habana Cuba. The food was ok although the steward told me that its always same. The cabin crew was friendly and did everything to make the flight as enjoyable as possible. The only minus was that the entertainment system didnt work. I took a flight back on 3rd August. The food was indeed the same.
Round trip between Bangkok and TokyoNarita with layover in Macau both times. Each of the four flights were delayed between 10 minutes and an hour and a half. Not a single on time departure on my trip. This airline seems to a have its pilots climb and descend very rapidly. There are economic advantages to this type of flying but it can be uncomfortable on your ears. Cabin temperature inconsistent hot at times and cold at times. For food fish rice was the only option on one of the legs the other also had a chicken and rice meal. I am 64 so very sensitive to seat pitch. I thought the seats were OK for the shorter flights but couldnt handle them for much longer. Aircrafts are older A320 and A321s that could use a refurbishment. We got a good price for these tickets so I will say the value wasnt bad.
The night before our departure husband 3 children and myself I tried to checkin. The message I was getting was checkin at airport. We arrive at the airport 3 hours ahead of our departure time only to be told there were no seats available and that I had not purchased seats. Then what did I purchase my airline indicated the time and date of our departure I can care less where they sit us. This was the way for them to try and justify that fact that they had oversold airline tickets. Then another agent proceeds by saying all airline over sell tickets bc sometimes passengers dont show up What do they care if passengers show up or not thats not their business the ticket was bought and paid for My friend and her two young girls were traveling on the same flight. One of her daughters ticket supposedly indicated it was for an infant so they made her purchase another airline ticket mind you an agent had already told us there were NO seats available but get this another passenger had purchased an airline ticket and selected her seat only to find out she wasnt going anywhere either. They didnt even have the courtesy to reimburse us. All they could do was beg other passengers to volunteer to stay behind so that my family and I could board. They got us on the next flight but no compensation. We had a commitment to attend and we unfortunately missed my cousins wedding rehearsal dinner due to the airlines fault.
Worst airline Ive tried We took 4 planes from Qatar to Bahrain and back through Abu Dhabi 3 of those flights got delayed. In one of the flights we had to sit in the aircraft without ventilation or AC for almost half an hour in a crowded flight. Not to mention The staff is not friendly at all and the tickets were pricy. I would not recommend this airline.
First time flying Virgin Australia since their financial demise and bail out. Its hard to tell what Virgin Australia is trying to be now its certainly not that much cheaper than a full service airline and flying it today reminded me of why spending that bit extra turns flying from a chore to something enjoyable. The quality of the seat and cabin were poor the seat offered no support and was cramped. No food of course and thats fine. But does the cabin crew have to walk up and down offering over and over The plane was ready on the tarmac on time but the crew were running 30mins late. With people lined up to board they announced the delay. I noticed at a nearby gate the Virgin crew were among the last to board the flight too. The pilots landing was hard a drop from the sky rather than a smooth glide. On arrival the cabin crew announced departure of some rows by the back doors. A few minutes later they said forget that everyone out the front door. There was a collective groan in the cabin. It appeared there were no staff around to operate the stairs for the back doors. Finally the male cabin manager looked asleep and could barely say anything to departing passengers while one of the hosties blocked departing customers while she was cleaning business class already only to fall over into an Economy X row and complain how late they are. A sitcom airline but Im not laughing.
Cape Town to Johannesburg. I am disgusted at the service I received at Flysafair I had booked my ticket through Travelstart and I was asked how many bags I would to pay for I then paid for 3 bags when doing my booking considering the fact that I was booking 6 return flights from Johannesburg to Cape Town and back again the cost for the bags was R450 which was calculated at R150 a bag. Once the online check in was opened I went online to check in and I selected our 6 seats next to each other however when I got to the airport air boarding passes had different seats numbers I was very unhappy with this because I was traveling with kids who were traveling by plane for the first time and I had to seat my children with strangers how upsetting. In any case I decided to do the online check again when it was time to come back and guess what we were placed in different seats again and to top it off I was told that I had not paid for my luggage and I had to now pay an additional R750 for the 3 bags because that is airport fees. I am very angry at the bad service I received be careful of these cheap airflights they actually not cheap and are actually a rip off. Why pay for luggage when Im already traveling with you guys I would much rather use Mango or Khulula next time. All the money I paid for nothing and their seats are uncomfortable and there very little space in fact no leg space at all.
Taipei to Delhi via Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific is moving straight into ignoring everyone except for Business Class travellers. At Cathay despite you paying a very high price for a ticket and having the highest loyalty card tier the flexibility of ground staff on luggage and seating is zero. They have no power to help you in anything. Avoid this airline at all cost if you dont fly Business or First Class as the level of service does not justify the ticket price. Seriously disappointed on the ground staff service.
Manokwari to Kaimana. Flight was 15 minutes late to depart. Check in staff very lenient about size of hand luggage. On board seats were fine aircon good cabin crew helpful. No food or drinks available even for purchase but who needs them on a short flight anyway Overall a smooth flight.
Dammam to Istanbul. The staff werent smiling but they were professional. I got into the plane and checked the Economy legroom it was good for an economy class seat and for a medium haul flight inflight entertainment is amazing The food was so delicious the staff really helped.
This is a horrible airline company. Not only do they delay flights by considerable hours last minute they have the audacity to pretend they care by giving a 10 voucher as if that helps in any way. They delayed my flight 3 times causing me to having to get a hotel room.
Leeds Bradford to Thessaloniki. For the most part this airline is fine. Both the outbound and return flights took off an hour late not the longest of delays but a bit annoying. The pilots made up a chunk of time on the return and we arrived only 25 mins after the scheduled time. I guess the swift turnaround helped to explain the lack of cleaning. Always a bit disconcerting to open ones tray table to find the spill marks of a previous passengers drink see pic. Same plane for both journeys a 27 yearold 737300. However it had been retrofitted including winglets and the interior looked very new. Apart from it being a little noisy the planes age was no issue. The seats were interesting plastic with minimal cushioning see pic. They didnt lean back a good thing and had tiny armrests a bad thing. I suppose it allows the airline to fit more in without reducing legroom. They were comfy enough for the first couple of hours but as we approached the third hour the lack of cushioning started to tell the plastic felt sticky avoid wearing shorts. The legroom was perfectly fine for short haul. This is the first flight Ive taken on which there were no window blinds or dimmers. A real curiosity and I cant think why they would be absent. It made the outbound journey uncomfortable until I fashioned a blind of my own using a sweatshirt. Until then the sun was pretty blinding and hot. As a budget product Jet2 is perfectly decent. Booking easy online checkin and printing of boarding passes easy no IFE but none was expected didnt bother ordering food but the menu items were predictably overpriced didnt pay for checkedin baggage as the 10kg allowance for hand luggage was enough for my short trip well done for this in particular Jet2. The staff were fine. Efficient and friendly enough without being overbearing. I felt a bit sorry for them to be honest having to spend much of their time trying to sell stuff. I guess its the necessary economy of the budget airline. I didnt like the fact that they prohibited the drinking of ones own alcoholic beverages and only allowed us to consume those bought on board. I appreciate theres a security aspect being able to refuse extra drinks to very drunk people but I suspect theres a profitbased motivation too. Naturally when the crew announced you shouldnt drink your own alcoholic drinks I understood it as you shouldnt get caught drinking your own alcoholic drinks. I was very discreet.
On October 13 I take my flight from Paris to Bahrain then Bahrain Bangkok. The Paris Bahrain flight is going very well. Arrived in Bahrain the flight Bahrain Bangkok is delayed the next day at 8.40 am which is 10 hours late and we face a refusal of care . The manager on the ground tells us all the flights of the other airlines are full and they have no hotel rooms available. After 2 hours distribution of good meals I take mine. An agent from Bahrain airport company calls out to me saying that it is not right to do this. I eat at kfc with my voucher. I take this opportunity to give my boarding pass with his group and we get accommodation at golden tulip. Once out we wait 50 minutes for the driver to take us to the hotel and a staff from Gulf air staff arrives the minivan can accommodate 15 people but she tried to park 30 of us in it and it made her laugh. Arrived at the 3 star hotel we were treated like cattle. The only sentence I heard when I arrived at the hotel is wait in line. At the hotel counter my passport and my boarding pass are kept and the person from the hotel tells me here is your room number its this way and we slept barely 3 hours. The next morning I notice that the buffet for passengers of the gulf air flight is downstairs and that the rest of the hotel has its buffet upstairs. At 7 am we leave the hotel for the airport. We get on the plane I tell all this to the purser who has absolutely nothing to do with it. Avoid this airline if you can.
London to Singapore via Doha was a disappointing journey. A380 is great so quiet and nice onboard lounge. Qatar Airways catering is usually very good but QR10 departing London at 0900 offered a poor breakfast service and that was it On the DOHSIN sector I skipped dinner to try to sleep on this 7 hour overnight flight but I couldnt wear the far too large sleeper suit and the cabin temperature was too high so I sweated and got dehydrated. Cabin air was as dry as older aircraft so I left the flight feeling rough. Not like Boeing 787 and not how A350 should be. My partner got a nosebleed because of dry cabin air. I was heading for Malaysia but chose Singapore over KL purely for the A350 which proved to be a mistake. A350 is not as quiet as A380 but the seat is the same. Transit in Doha was badly managed with no staff to guide transfer passengers to correct route.
Moscow to Prague. Service below standard. Flew CSA business class from Moscow to Prague. All aspects of the service was not in line with what is normally offered in business class. And definitively much below what direct competitor is offering. It is in terms of the overall customer care comfort of the seats selection of the meal in fact there was no selection etc. I found CSA business class only marginally better than Lufthansa or Austrian economy. Though significantly more expensive. Not a value for money.
London to Mexico City return flights on British Airways for me and my partner using Avios and an Amex companion voucher. The flights were on time seat very comfortable entertainment decent and the food and drink was of significantly better quality than its Club World equivalent. Cabin crew on both flights were excellent.
The Melbourne to Wellington flight is an early morning flight arriving in Wellington in the afternoon just in time for most hotel checkins. The shorthaul international flight serves one round of meals with 4 options for mains available. I went for the cheese omelette and it was great. Cabin service was exceptional as usual. However the aircraft itself is very dated especially the seats. The seats are in a 222 configuration and its not the best Singapore Airlines Business Class seats. Its okay for the shorthaul flight as they turn into flatangled beds. Theres lots of leg space and decent width. Inflight entertainment technology was dated but the content is good in terms of library and variety. All in all its definitely the best MelbourneWellington offering when compared to narrowbodied aircrafts of Qantas Virgin Australia and Air New Zealand but its not the best SQ offering.
From Doha to Cochi. Qatar Airways Economy class is great really good service. I am very impressed by cabin crew staff Miss Sakie who served the QR 516 Economy class. The way she deal with the clients are impressive and she was really helpful as well
Transavia cancelled my flight without notice stranding me in Thessaloniki. Over the course of several calls and a dozen complaint filings they have claimed that I was sent a cancellation notice then said that I was not sent a cancellation notice and then said that actually they didnt cancel the flight that it was actually Delta with whom I booked the flight. Obviously these things cannot all be true and Transavia has adopted a business model of lying to its customers. I wasnt able to get to my destination and am now out hundreds of dollars for rebooked travel and lodging. Do not fly with this shady outfit they are unscrupulous and will screw you over.
Yogyakarta to Bangkok via Jakarta. Checking in luggage will cost you much more than the airfare. I checked in at JOG and was told check in luggage is not included and have pay 22K IDR kg 1.60 USD. I arrived in Jakarta and had to recheck in for my flight to Bangkok. I was told check in baggage is not included and the policy had changed as of Jan 15. For this flight I was required to pay 224K IDRkg 16 USD. The airfare was 1.8M 130 USD cost of checking in luggage 3.9M 282 USD 217 more than the airfare. I ended up walking away from the flight to Bangkok and booked with AirAsia instead. Part of the problem with not foreseeing these issues is Lion Air does not accept Western credit cards and I had to go through a 3rd party site for booking. After going through this experience there is absolutely no way I would ever fly with this airline and stick with airlines you can book directly with so there are no surprises.
San Francisco to Indianapolis. I was on my last leg of journey home from New Zealand. I flew out with American an then Fiji Air New Zealand Jetstar in New Zealand and they were all great. The staff on Virgin America need to fly with these airlines and learn how to smile be friendly and not look grouchy. A smile goes a long way.
Travelled Johannesburg Kimberley Johannesburg and Johannesburg Gaborone Johannesburg in June. SAX has refurbished all their Dash 8300s so seating very comfortable stylish blue leather seats with adjustable headrests more comfortable than seats on many larger jet aircraft. Service good on all sectors however catering seems to be hitormiss and inconsistent in terms of quality and quantity. JNBKIM flight departs at 0555 with a flight duration of 1h20 appaling breakfast is served consisting of yoghurt a few pieces of melon and papaya that they call a fruit salad and a stale dry unappetising muffin. Return flight from Kimberley at 1935 different story delicious chicken wrap savoury biscuits and chocolate. JNBGBE although flight is only 50 minutes and departed at 0730 a full breakfast was served why they cannot do this on the Kimberley flight is beyond me. Bread roll cold meats cheese and fruit. Afternoon departure from Gaborone at 1540 the most disappointing of all... snack box handed out opens to reveal a packet of mixed nuts and a packet of crisps This definitely leads one to feel ripped off at having paid over R2500 for the return flight to Gaborone. Air Botswana by comparison have taken heed to catering feedback and replaced their peanutandbiltong service with proper sandwiches etc on board. A little consistency at SAX would be great
Hobart to Melbourne. We arrive at afternoon 130pm to check in. Only one hour trip and we arrived 8 hrs 3 mins late. The airplane delay till middle night time 12. When we went to asked staff reason they said that Tigerair Australia is budget airline. So what Budget doesnt mean terrible and unavailable.
I am writing this review to express my deep dissatisfaction and disappointment with the travel experience we encountered with Fly Play on flight OG102. I must acknowledge our own contribution to the problem as we were running just a little bit late for the flight and we fully understand and accept that responsibility. However what followed left us perplexed and disheartened. Upon realizing that the flight was delayed by approximately 50 minutes my husband and I experienced travelers considered this a fortunate turn of events. We proceeded to the check baggage counter which was unmanned understandable given our tardiness. We decided to get through TSA and inquire about gate checking our baggage at the gate. To our surprise we encountered an extremely rude and unreasonable gate attendant. We politely requested if we could gate check our bag. Unfortunately her response was an immediate refusal without providing any explanation. This was particularly disheartening as gate check had been a feasible option in the past including with Play in September. Our attempts to seek clarification or speak to someone else were met with further hostility. The gate attendant claimed to be the sole authority and refused any further assistance which left us feeling unheard and disrespected. The situation escalated when the gate attendant intentionally covered her name tag and displayed an offensive gesture towards us. We were unable to board the flight and learned from the chat bot that we were labeled as did not fly due to inappropriate behavior. This statement is categorically false and we were relieved when Play ultimately offered discounted tickets as compensation after hours of pleading via chat and trying to come to some resolution. Nonetheless we firmly believe that the entire situation could and should have been handled more professionally and with greater courtesy by your employee who represents your companys values and image. While we understand that being late reduced our chances of boarding the flight we firmly believe that every passenger deserves to be treated with respect and kindness. We would have gladly accepted any reasonable explanation for not being able to gate check our bag. Instead the encounter left us with a sense of shock and disappointment that overshadowed the entire travel experience. We sincerely hope that this matter will be taken seriously and addressed appropriately to prevent similar incidents in the future. As loyal customers we believe in the value of constructive feedback and we trust that Fly Play will endeavor to ensure a more positive and respectful experience for all passengers.
LHRPEKLHR. We travel BA club world often and my overall impression is very good. Yes sometimes the attitude of the staff can be not up to expectations or the food not comparable with some of the Asian airlines but the price you pay for a business class seat with BA is unbeatable. And for me a flat bed on an overnight flight is what matters the most. Contrary to general recommendations when I travel with a companion I prefer the middle seats on the main deck and not the upper deck because by using the screen you can have your own little intimate cabin. And if the flight is not full is so much better than the claustrophobic upper deck. Strongly recommended for a discounted ticket.
Flight Subang to Penang on 20th April was on time and crew were friendly even though flight was full. The last flight I took before this departed early in the morning and it was a rush about 67 flights departing with around 5 mins gap. The airport needs to add more gates and improve signage to the aircraft. Firefly staff did the best they could and even managed a quick smile. The latest flight took place mid morning and it was not as hectic on departure as the early morning one. Departure from Penang was ok gate was far from the counters and one level down but the aircraft is right in front of the gate If you are travelling exPenang dont go to the gate too early as there is absolutely nothing down there. Prices seem to be lower than before. I remember thinking that the fares were high when I flew them last year but the last few trips were around the 100 ringgit not USD mark which is OK.
Cebu to Puerto Princesa. The web site is slow and if you get it to work it will not be transferred to the airline. I paid twice for additional baggage to be told at the counter there was no record of the online transaction.
SHA to HKG with B737800. The seat was comfortable but legroom was quite tight. The cabin attendants were friendly and spoke good English. The meal was good surprisingly sandwich on Chinese airline. The flight entertainment was not available even though there was ear phone socket and they played some documentary on the overhead monitors.
Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale. Charging to choose seats even within 24h prior take off is outrageous. So if someone decides to carry only hand luggage one cannot choose a seat without paying extra charges
Manila to Taipei. This is my first time flying with EVA Air I was so lucky that I got the best price for this shorthaul flight. Even though the plane that theyve used was a Airbus A321 which is normally used in domestic flights the legroom in the seats are beyond normal. The food is great and the flight attendants are alert to your needs. The best flight that I rode for shorthaul international flight.
This airline doesnt even deserve 1 star if you ask me. Myself along with a group of friends had booked a round trip from Vancouver to Peurto Escondido with a connection in Mexico City. After booking our trip our flights had been changed at least 4 times leaving us with a 6 hour layover in Mexico City which none of us were happy with as we had planned on arriving in Puerto earlier that day. Because of this change we all decided to book a flight that would get us to our destination sooner therefore missing our connecting flight. We assumed everything was fine as all of us continued to receive emails regarding our trip home with Aeromexico we were even able to check in for our flights online. Little did we know because we had decided to miss that connection in Mexico City Aeromexico decided to cancel all of our return trips with no notice. We found this out because a friend of ours had left a day early and gave us a heads up so we called the airline. They were able to reactivate some of our tickets but 3 of our friends were forced to pay another 1200 to buy seats on the same flight back that they initially had. They also do not put the correct gate on the boarding pass or light board which makes for a very stressful airport experience.
MADVALMAD. A very satisfactory flying experience with flights leaving on time. Nice comfortable leather seats well turned out and friendly cabin crew who saw to the needs of my grandson by providing a colouring book and pencils. Light refreshments and newspapers were also provided. A pleasant change from flying budget airlines.
TAME has decent Boeing 727200s from Lufthansa and a couple of new Airbus A320s as well. Service appears to be much safer better maintenance and in comparison to flights a few years ago one life jacket per passenger though food and service can be very basic no major surprise this airline is operated by the Ecuadorian Air Force Transportes Aereos Militares Ecuatorians.
Calgary to London. Staff were not in high standards. Looked rushed and not polite did not look professional enough. In our flight back to London staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraft. There was not welcome snacks. We sat in the very last row and food choice ended. Only chicken was our option to have. Very sad and staff did not care about this situation.
Flew from GRU to SCL on 4 January Seat 2A. Quick efficient check in. Flight was on a seemingly older A320. Cabin crew were polite and attentive kept filling up drinks meal was OK. No individual IFE screen only 2 screens for the three rows of Business Class. Seat only partially reclined made sleep difficult but only a 4 hour flight. Expect more for International Business Class.
Singapore to Jakarta with Singapore Airlines. Disappointing aircraft. The crews are fine. But not necessarily showing great service. Further the mobile apps of the airline was down and most of the time I couldnt check in online. Bad experience overall. Expensively priced which makes it a very overpriced disappointing experience.
Moscow to St Petersburgh. A new A350 plane with business class suites. They have a bad pillow which I do not find comfortable and a a bad blanket.
The worst airline ever. 3 hours delayed flight without any update information no information at the airport about flight status. Call center barely reached but Ive been charged 10k isk for a call with waiting over an hour In addition agent who Ive talked with was so rude and unpleasant Shame for Serbia never again fly with Air Serbia.
I am frequent flyer with Air Astana. Almaty Dubai is the best available option. The check in procedure at the business class counter works smoothly without any problems. Business lounge at Almaty Airport is not good. Boarding is OK still some airport problems not enough jet bridges. The seats are comfortable for a five hour flight if it is not a night flight. The catering is perfect flight attendants are very attentive beautiful smiles. The entertainment program is OK we are provided with iPad in business class with good choice of the video programming. Internet is missing on this type of the aircraft.
Manila to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. I was so happy that I can use Inflight Entertainment System unlike Cebu Pacific doesnt have it. Also foods no need to pay it is free. On our connecting flight we almost missed the plane for Singapore to Manila. Running and running after we landed at Singapore from Kuala Lumpur of SilkAir. Its a little bit delay of Silk Air Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. We thank God that we still catch up the flight I recommend Singapore Airlines
Vienna to Milan. They play with the delay on both my routes they were late. VIE to MXP was late 2 hours 55 minutes not surprisingly as EU rules say over 3 hours the company has to reimburse and compensate customers.
I was due to travel from Philadelphia to Brussels direct flight at 620pm 17 August. The flight was delayed for 2 hours before they informed us that the aircraft needed to be changed. After the aircraft was changed and we actually took off 20 minutes into the flight there was a technical problem and we were informed that the plane had to return to Philadelphia. After we returned to the airport we were told that there was another plane ready for us and were left there for 3 hours waiting for a crew to arrive. In the end there was no crew and the flight was cancelled. It took another 3 hours to rebook everyone on different flights. It was disorganised chaos with no guidance whatsoever as to how to get vouchers and how to get to our hotels. It was 4am by the time we got to our hotel. I was rebooked on a flight to Brussels via Munich due to depart at 630pm on 18 August. After boarding was completed we were told that there was a technical problem were left on the plane for 1.5 hours without any update. Eventually we were told to disembark and to board another plane. This was the 3rd plane with technical issues in a period of 24 hours. We eventually departed at 10pm. The staff on the flight were extremely rude and patronising. The inflight entertainment was a nightmare to use as the touch screen was pretty much not working. I would definitely not recommend this airline.
Flew Air France from Buenos Aires to Paris. Very nice flight. Travelling long haul with my 2 year old daughter alone for the first time. I got the flight with airmiles from the Brazilian airline GOL for a very good price especially considering it was the week of Christmas. I was able to use the Aerolineas Argentinas lounge at EZE which was well equipped. Boarding was efficient and having taken our seats the purser came up to introduce himself to me I am Flying Blue Platinum which I thought was a nice touch. Food was very nice and my daughters child meal was exceptional. Seats were for economy as good as can be with sufficient leg room for me I am 6 feet 2. Flight was punctual. Horrendous turbulence which caused distress to some passengers which was very professionally dealt with by the crew. Recently moved to Skyteam from One World and each time I fly with Air France KLM Alitalia Delta I become increasingly pleased that I did. Thanks Air France for making my Christmas happy
Blantyre to Lilongwe. On this leg one of my bags didnt not pitch up at Lilongwe alerted staff immediately I was relaxed that it could solved in few hours why because when I was boarding at Blantyre there were 2 planes one to Lilongwe then Lusaka then Harare the other to Johannesburg on the ground about to leave same time thought a simple mixup of bags when loading. I was totally wrong the staff were and still are clueless. It did not appear to them that a customer is adversely been affected and inconvenienced for them to make simple calls yes a simple call to alert their staff in Johannesburg or Harare or Lusaka to check out my luggage when the offloading. I had totally underestimated their incompetence till today no feedback and no luggage and noone has an answer. For me I am not flying with you guys gain better pay extra bucks and get the utmost airliner customer support professionalism. We all know luggage got misplaced but this is way down the ladder in handling such things. You should be prepared for such images and act.
Seats available but they split the family leave the kids by themselves. I need to pray to my kids dont spills soda on the next passenger. Its not because the 50 bucks to change 4 seats. The company has no ethics or consideration for the consumer. Do you think that 50 for 4 seats will change the companys results
The worst service ever my baggage did not arrive on time. Both my flights were delayed. I will never fly them again. Even the food was bad and your service.
We took Porter Airlines from Montreal to Toronto our flight was supposed to be at 515pm but we were told that they will not be able to take all of our luggage so we must travel with our luggage on the next flight at 9pm. By the time we arrived in Toronto on the later flights we were told that Our luggage will be arriving on the next day flight. We got 4 of our luggage delivered on the second day in damaged condition. It took more than 1 12 month to process my damage claim after several calls and emails. Then one month after that I was told to buy 4 bags around 700worth submit a claim and they will reimburse me. I submitted my receipt for the new luggage it has been over 7 weeks I still did not get my reimbursement. I have made numerous calls to the person who sent me confirmation the baggage claim customer service and several other department to find out the status. No one is responding to my inquiry nor the claim. Very slow process to everything no use of calling Customer service or any other departments no one is owing up the responsibilities. Very poor customer care.
My co passenger was suffering from headache. From his frustration since inside flight i enquired about this. So he asked for one tablet just to survive the time of fight .. no one care of this. Then he requested again the air hostess gave him one tablet after he asked for water. The strange thing is that they asked him for money for water. Its so strange and disappointing situation. I am so annoyed how they may consider for passengers during emergency medical conditions.
Short flight to Shiraz from Tehran. Mahan Air already has a reputation of being an airline of choice for travelling within Iran for both safety and service and I could see why. While the type of plane is old an A300 it was well maintained and clean. The seating was very impressive definitely the widest and the most legroom I have had in a long time in both long and shorthaul flights. For a 1.5 hour flight I was surprised to be served a substantial cold meal. Nonalcoholic beverages are served on the flight. The service was courteous and efficient but not warm. We landed 20 minutes early. The airfare was dirt cheap 60 one way at last minute You cant book directly on their website with an international card but can certainly book through thirdparty sites but checkin is available online.
London Heathrow Nur Sultan Almaty in December 2019 returning 8 days later. Check in at LHR was efficient and fast track through security excellent. However the flight was then delayed at the last minute and there was hardly any seating at the gate where we had to wait no announcementsupdates and few staff who seemed a little disorganised and unhelpful. Several passengers including myself had connecting flights which was making people quite agitated as they were unsure what would happen if they missed their connections. Once aboard the cabin layout and space were excellent. Staff were efficient polite and you were made to feel very welcome. The food choices were great very tasty and portion sizes just right. There was a huge choice of drink options too. The seat converted easily to a very low level lay flat bed and I managed to sleep for a few hours. Upon arrival in Nur Sultan I was met off the flight prearranged and taken through security with a quick stop in the lounge to freshen up before joining my connecting flight on to Almaty. The lady who met me was excellent and couldnt have been more helpful. It was a huge help to me as I was travelling alone and there was very limited time to pass from international to domestic and then find my onward flight to Almaty. She spoke perfect English and made the transfer very smooth for me. The flight to ALA was good. Plenty of leg room and great adjustments on the seat especially for leg support but perhaps more tricky to climb out of from a window seat than the previous flight layout. The breakfast menu was excellent as you could choose anything from a pastry and coffee right up to a full cooked breakfast. The cabin crew served this efficiently in a limited time frame. My return journey was equally enjoyable. On the Nur Sultan to LHR leg there were about 40 seats not occupied in business class which made the experience even more special as the staff had more time to ensure you were comfortable. It was nice to be able to enjoy this leg during daylight hours as Id slept a chunk of the outward version of this leg All in all I really enjoyed my first experience with Air Astana. The only disappointment was the initial delays at Heathrow the area we had to wait and how these were handled by the ground staff there.
Singapore to Sydney. The decline in service and product continues from Singapore Airlines. Premium Economy includes plastic glasses only two wine choices Red or White only one glass was offered per passenger and the food offering economy standard. Neither of the above are consistent with the airlines advertised offer. The were no maskssocks offered. The A380 Premium Economy seats are much poorer design compared to the A350 seat in the same classairline. Hard vinyl covered seats impossible to get comfortable in. Booked a window seat but impossible to lean against the window as seat is 200mm from window. Unless you can book for only 1015 more than economy I wouldnt bother Entertainment is good in its range but the system is unstable. Wifi wouldnt connect
Party of 4 2 couples traveling together last minute 1 hour before our seats changed. I upgraded everyone to row 11 now one is in 11 3 are in 26th row. We were told the plane changed and we cant honor your seat selection. Poor customer service. We were not the only party where the seats changed. When I called customer service he stated well this happens occasionally
Unpleasant Experience with Sun Country Airlines Cancellation Policy. An encounter that left me profoundly disappointed and frustrated. Two days before my trip I got sick and had to cancel my trip to Florida. While I understand that cancellation policies are a necessity for businesses to run efficiently I was dismayed by the lack of flexibility shown by Sun Country. They offered me a travel voucher for my flight cancellation subtracting a 150 fee which I accepted despite it seeming like a high cancelation fee. I must now book a flight within a year. However the real bone of contention lies with the rental car I booked through them. Sun Country refused to issue a refund for the rental car since it was less than 2 days from departure a policy that I find exorbitantly unfair and far from customerfriendly. I also contacted Avis the rental car company I discovered they would have only billed me upon car pickup indicating that my cancellation incurred no loss on their part. To add to my frustration I found that the rental car pricing offered by Sun Country was more expensive than alternatives like Expedia or Kayak. It became evident that these other platforms provided better pricing and allowed for cancellation without charges. Reflecting on this experience I regret bundling auto rental services with Sun Country Airlines. The lack of transparency customer consideration and higher costs was disheartening and left a bitter taste. From now on I will refrain from bundling services with Sun Country Airline a lesson learned at a steep price. I hope my experience is a cautionary tale for others who value customer service transparency and flexibility.
MEXLIMMEX in business class. The outward flight left at midnight with an arrival time of 5.30am approx. This was too short a flight to catch up on much sleep although the plane was new or refurbished almost flat beds and a large screen with AVOD. A full meal service was offered but I decided to get some shuteye instead and slept through until just before landing. No breakfast or snack which would have been a nice alternative to the late night meal. Basic amenity kit no toothbrush and no hot towels prior to landing. Return flight on a shabby 767 with reclining seats but no AVOD. Plane in need of refurbishment with chipped paintwork and frayed carpets. FAs came round with a drink prior to takeoff and started taking orders for lunch soon after reaching cruising altitude lunch was adequate with an OK choice of Chilean wines beers spirits etc. The orange juice and coffee instant were undrinkable. FAs attentive and attempted to get my name right Both flights were on time although there was a longish delay for baggage at MEX on return caused by thorough checks by sniffer dogs probably to be expected on this route.
Worst ever company. I travel every 2 weeks and I use this airline only because of the flight hours. 810 times has a delay and the worst is that they never inform passengers about the time of delay. They show zero respect to their customers.
My first trip with OpenSkies was excellent. The lounge at Dulles is very nice the plane was spacious food and wine were good. The return was fine as well. My next trip the first leg went very smoothly but now as I approach the final part I am terribly frustrated and disappointed with OpenSkies. Unfortunately I had to book my return flight for this summer in November when my schedule was still a bit up in the air. About 3 weeks ago however I finalized my schedule and saw to my dismay that I would need to change my ticket by about two months. I was bracing myself for a ticket change fee but was shocked to find out that in order to change my ticket giving them months notice I will need to pay 450 in addition to about 150 extra for increased gas prices thats 600 extra for a flight change with months notice I emailed and called and spoke with many people all said that same thing thats policy no way around it. Now I dont expect a big cooperation to just change their policy for me but I do expect some sort of help or at least a little sympathy when I pay thousands of dollars for a ticket. The lack of care or sympathy from those I spoke and emailed with astonished me Not only did they not give me a break at all but they didnt even put out the effort to seem sorry for my circumstances. Perhaps most people who use this airline are wealthy but I am not. I used them this year as a special treat and now I am absolutely paying for it. As of today I can buy a round trip ticket with British Airways from Paris to NY for less than 600. And unless a miracle happens soon Ill be paying 600 just to switch the day of my flight. I think it is ridiculous that I have to pay such an extravagant fee to change a flight with months of notice
New York to Tel Aviv. I dont recommend El Al to anyone the service is really bad. They broke my bag and there is no one to whom to talk too.
Tokyo Haneda to Melbourne via Singapore. Due to the coronavirus crisis I had to bring my flight forward by five weeks. Once I got through to it the call centres staff were efficient in getting me suitable flights. Checkin at Haneda was friendly and quick. The ANA lounge was comfortable with a great view of the runway although food and drink options were limited due to antivirus precautions. The Singapore lounge was very spacious with a good variety of food and drink choices. Onboard both flights the seats were very comfortable and the service was impeccable. My Chinesestyle vegetarian meal on the first leg was very tasty but the Indianstyle vegetarian meal on the second leg was not as impressive with little curry and a lot of bread. There were several drinks rounds on both flights. I managed to get a good sleep on a comfortable long bed. Both flights arrived slightly early. All in all an excellent experience.
12 hours before flight departure SA Express only contacted some passengers to advise of a change in flight. Despite paying double for a direct flight we were redirected via Johannesburg and what should have been a 2 hour journey ended up taking 8 hours The way we were treated by ground staff in Cape Town and Johannesburg was appalling and despite raising the complaint numerous times have only had a standardised response and still no apology for the inconvenience. We were offered some compensation but only for 3 of the 4 travellers and still no response on this despite it being escalated to management. Do not recommend to ever use this airline
Within 2 weeks I have had the unfortunate experience of flying with Vueling connecting through Barcelona with other cities. On both occasions the initial flight has left 3 hours late and I have lost the connection for 10 minutes. Apparently due to problems with the construction of a new track in Barcelona combined with strikes by European controllers. So far bad luck it happens in the best families. But what defines companies and people in how they manage difficulties. Leaving aside the flight staff who have always been very professional I have not been able to speak to anyone from Vueling they have all been Iberia staff on loan to Vueling. Impossible to talk on the phone with anyone other than a machine that based on typing options puts you in a circle of options whose final output is to refer you to the web never to a person. When you try the web the experience is similar but nobody solves the problem just send a message and well see. Im still waiting for an answer from my first flight. Today stuck in Barcelona Ive been in 4 queues for 1 hour each at this time I should be at home but Im saving the 5th queue of the day because the hotel they gave me only has one checkin person when there are 100 of us those of us who have missed the flight. The drama of all this is that I knew that I was losing the connection then vueling too but I imagine that the artificial intelligence that seems to manage Vueling was on Saturday and the intelligence was off. What an embarrassing airline. If I can avoid it I will not fly with them anymore. En le plazo de 2 semanas he tenido la desafortunada experiencia que e volar con Vueling conectando por Barcelona con tras ciudades. En ambas ocasiones el vuelo incial ha salido con 3 horas de retraso y he perdido la conexion por 10 minutos. Segun parece por problemas de construccion de una nueva pista en Barcelona combinado con huelgas de controladores europeos. Hasta aqui mala suerte pasa en las mejores familias. Pero lo que define a empresas y personas en como gestionan las dificultades. Dejando aparte al personal de vuelo que siempre ha sido may profesional no he podido hablar con nadie de vueling todo han sido personal de Iberia cedido a vueling. Imposible hablar por telefono con nadie que no sea una maquina que a base de teclear opciones te mete en un circulo de opciones cuya salida final es remitirte a la web nunca a una persona. Cuando intentas la web la experiencia es similar pero nadie te solventa el problema solo manda un mensaje y ya veremos.de mi primer vuelo aun espero respuesta. Hoy atrapado en Barcelona llevo 4 colas cada una de 1 hora a estas horas deberia estar en mi casa pero estoy guard ado la 5a cola del dia pq el hotel a me han dado solo tiene una persona de check in cuando somos 100 los q henos perdido el vuelo. El drama de todo esto es que yo sabia que perdia la conexion luego vueling tambien pero me imagino que la inteligencia artificial que parece gestionar Vueling estaba de sabado y la inteligencia de descanso. Que verguenza de aerolinea. Si puedo evitarlo no volare mas con ellos.
Very frustrating mainly poor customer service. The employees at the Orlando terminal were not helpful rude and didnt share information. The plane was delayed numerous times but no notifications were given after the first few. There was no explanation for the delay ever. At one point the employees got onoff the plane with no explanation. And then they all went back on the plane and locked the door. Leaving no employee at all inside the terminal. If you approached the desk or attempted to ask questions you were shooed away or lied to. Then when time to board we were rushed completely unprofessional and unsafe onto the plane. No boarding groups at all. Just a big line they even said we have 5 minutes to get you on hurry. Its very unfortunate given the lower cost and convenience of flying out of smaller airports that this company cant do better. Customer service goes a long way. Ill spread the word to my locals to be wary of this company until they have improved their customer service team and consider hiring someone else to staff their terminal that is more professional empathetic and safe.
Id rate Lynx a 0 if that were an option. Calgary to Winnipeg 26 May 2023. The flight was delayed by almost 4 hours. Lynx had my email and cell yet did not advise me until I arrived at the airport 3 hours before originally scheduled departure as the confirmation email demanded. They offered no apologies no meals and no compensation of any kind and there were no staff at the departure gate to approach with questions. After sitting there for 3 hours I noticed people coming to the gate so I asked them what flight they were taking and if they were also going to Winnipeg how did they know to arrive when they did. They told me that they had received emails the evening before advising them of the new departure time. When the gate staff finally arrived they told me that the aircraft had been in Calgary overnight and wasnt delayed due to weather or issues elsewhere. It was simply due to staff shortage. I asked for clarification and why some had been advised the night before while many hadnt and she acted as if I shouldnt be surprised let alone annoyed. She offered only what felt like an insincere apology and I got the impression that she had been put in this position many times before. Fast forward 40 minutes or so and literally as they finally announced that boarding was commencing in a few minutes they also announced 10 food vouchers that were good only in the Calgary airport and only from that moment until departure. Few people took this seriously as they couldnt see how they would be able to get anything and be back in time to board. I had already been in the airport for 7 hours without eating so decided to take advantage of this offer at a nearby sandwich shop. These vouchers were handmade and looked like some childs scam attempt. The cashier looked at it and literally laughed and called over a coworker. She said Im surprised that Lynx is still pulling this. They know that no one accepts them yet they are still handing them out Im sorry to tell you but that is worthless. I paid for the sandwich and made it back just in time to board. Once on board I could hear many people peppering the flight crew with questions similar to mine and realized that they were unable to offer any help. Once in Winnipeg there were no gate staff to discuss this with so I called Lynx once at my destination. I waited on the phone for two hours with no one ever answering. Ive called back 3 times since and no one answers the phone. Ive contacted them through their online option and only ever received BOT replies. Emails have gone unanswered. Today I called again and enabled the speakerphone. 5 hours later and I had to plug in the charger. 7 hours later and still no one had answered. They obviously are not even slightly interested in customer satisfaction or growing a successful airline. Fly Lynx only if you have financial constraints AND if you have plenty of time to waste. And definitely DO NOT fly with them if you have any kind of commitment at your destination.
Cabin crew on this airline seem not to care at all about security on board. I have recently flown domestic from Ashgabat to Mary and the person seated in front of me refused to put his seat into the upright position for takeoff and landing. Even though I asked a flight attendant to intervene she asked the gentleman in vain to comply with security instructions but finally gave up and just walked away. I had to call her again tell her I would report her and the gentleman in front of me to the police after landing until she asked the purser to show up and solve the problem. Another gentleman came back 2 times from the washroom smelling of cigarette. It was so obvious he had been smoking. No one said a thing.
San Jose to Golfito. I had a flight booked with them February 7th 2008 but they were not flying due to the government shutting them down. I have tried on numerous occasions to get my money refund. I even took out insurance. The company will not refund any of my money. If and when the do fly again stay clear of Nature Air the worst airline ever.
The worst airline I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. Sent wrong information about the flight no apology Not informed of changes no apology. Call centre staff are unhelpful no apology. Spent over an hour calling them to request refund from another country and they gave no solution and will not even show the courtesy to call or even email customer back. They have no regard for customer.
Los Angeles to Chengdu. I was worried if I could get into a quality sleep during the flight as I saw 56 infants spread around business cabin including one right behind me. I raised my concern to business cabin manager who promised me that the crew will look into the best arrangement once the flight in air and with their best effort to ensure all of us have a great journey during the flight. Once the flight took off she worked with other crew members and moved passengers with all infants to front section of the business cabin so the back end of the cabin became relatively quiet. Crew members also frequently helped moms to comfort these babies and kept them comfortable so we got a great rest during the entire flight and was in full energy when deplaned. Staff provided superb flight experience to passengers and went far beyond what is normal.
Hong Kong to Hanoi. First delayed for 45 minutes then delayed again for 2 hours technical issues. They provided 75 HKD restaurant voucher. After getting on the plane the departure was delayed for 50mins. They shouldnt have made customers wait in the flight.
Doha to Trivandrum. Not value for money. Seats very congested very poor boarding. Always getting delayed find insects in seat area. The toilet not at all clean. Snack provided is not good.
Zagreb to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. We were checking in into our flights. After everybody had checkedin bags we converged on a spot at the airport to gather everyone in the group. As we were heading towards security I realized that we werent issued the cabin bag tags as I recalled we had those when we were on a TK flight from Kuala Lumpur the week before. Then I asked the ticketing counter for a tag for my cabin bag and the Turkish Airlines staff gladly gave it to me. Then 2 minutes later another staff chased us halfway across the airport and told me rather rudely you cant take those. Their own staff gave it to me why is she telling me like I just took it from behind the counter myself Then she went on about everybody needs to have their cabin bags checked immediately. Then I asked her why werent they checked before when we were checking in and issued the tags She said in an accusing tone because you were hiding your bags. There were 25 of us in the group how could their ground staff there were three of them not notice any of our cabin bags when we were checking in This single experience soured our holiday. We were corraled back to the checkin counter to have our bags weighed we were treated like petty thieves. None of our bags exceeded 5kgs in the end. The funny thing is the group after us none of their cabin bags were issued the cabin bag tags or even required to have their cabin bags weighed I waited and looked at them while they were checking in so I can confirm this myself. So why is there a different treatment for them This doesnt look like a standard operating procedure to me.
This was a wonderful trip and cabin crew showed warm service and professionalism. Even under the epidemic HNA still maintains amazing cabin service. The flight attendants try their best to maintain high standards of service to make me feel comfortable and respected. I believe I will choose Hainan Airlines flight next time I travel.
I feel discriminated against the basis of my daughters disability and would like to file a complaint. On September 20 at 1830 I was flying with my daughter from Tbilisi to Bologna. I was accompanying my daughter who had been diagnosed with Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy or hypoxicischemic encephalopathy HIE since birth. For your information people with DCP have problems controlling the movement of their hands arms feet and legs making it difficult to sit and walk. By 1830 all the passengers were already inside the plane however no one had approached us nor told us to get into the plane. I was standing there with my daughter not knowing what to do nor how to take my child to the place without a wheelchair. There was no accommodations for our circumstance. All I could see around was rude incompetent staff who were scruffy sour faced and unhelpful. They were screaming instructions repeatedly without breaking from their script to answer any questions. The immigration officers would do nothing but look at us and order to wait. When I asked the officer standing there when the attendant would take my daughter inside the plane on a wheelchair since the plane was almost ready to take off I received an extremely rude answer I dont know Wait Wait for what when the plane was almost taking off Do the airport staff ever receive special training to learn basic customer service
Surat Thani to Bangkok. When we tried adding extra baggage the mobile site did not work. We tried the process on 2 different phones on the evening beforehand. Since we were travelling and had to reach deadlines we were not able to complete the process online. When we arrived at the airport they charged 300 baht per kilo of checked in baggage. Initially they were asking for 4500 baht around 150 for the 15 kg bag but I managed to get it down to 9 kg by throwing belongings away and packing stuff into the carry on baggage. This exceeds the cost of the flight and is unacceptable in my eyes. While booking they never showed the costs for this and I am steaming over the fact their mobile site was this useless. Personel was of little to no help and I refuse to fly with them in the future.
LCYMAD Embraer 190. Business class but not so youd notice What you dont get advance seat selection only option is to checkin online 24 hours in advance to discover that others have somehow managed to get in before you priority checkin fast track security doesnt exist Lounge none no Priority boarding. So youve boarded the aircraft and theres not been a jot of difference travelling business class. Board the aircraft and you sit in exactly the same seat as everyone else but yours has a headrest cover. Arrive at Madrid and your bags come off last. What you get a hot meal but no choice of menu stewardess walked down the aisle telling everyone that the menu was steak and potatoes actually lamb.
Picked flight based on price. Flight from Miami to Buenos Aires was delayed by 6 hours and then canceled until the next day due to mechanical problem with plane. Rebooked on flight the next day. Luggage did not arrive in Buenos Aires for four days. Return flight delayed by 3 hours resulting in missed connection. All flights including connections on Delta were booked through Aerolineas Argentinas. No help from Miami staff rebooking connection on partner Delta. Ground staff in Miami sent us to the Delta counter to figure it out for ourselves. Delta would not rebook without us paying for new flight ourselves. Went back to Aerolineas Argentinas counter to find them closed until that evenings flight. Ended up renting car and driving 13 hours home.
Short hop on this airline belonging to the Lufthansa Group. Basically not really worse than flying with many European Airlines who claim to be Premium letting you anyway pay for food drinks seats luggage etc so I wont complain. Eurowings is a low cost airline. Crew was joyful and cabin presented well even if the seat pitch at the back of the plane isnt great. Pay for food is reasonably priced and the crew handled the process efficiently. Love Eurowings boarding concept two groups. Priority with those having booked a fare including a larger cabin luggage and normal boarding for those with standard hand luggage.
Horrible experience. I arrived too late to check in meaning I lost my flight. Six other passengers and I had to wait in line and deal with extremely rude customer service employees. They gave us two options fly to San Francisco in two days for 200 euros or fly to New York tomorrow for 500 euros. I watched as people paid the 500 euros each to get on the next flight. The customer service people had no sympathy for us.
Yesterday I returned to London Heathrow from Istanbul on flight TK1971 I have flown Turkish Airlines before and found them to be very good however yesterday cabin service was poor. It was almost 2 hours into the flight before we were served a drink and the meal choice was just one pasta option we were told that the meat options had gone. My wife cannot eat pasta so was given a vegetarian dish which looked very unappetising and my pasta was lukewarm and dry. The attitude of the cabin crew was that it was our fault as we should have preordered a special meal.
Flew with Sriwijaya Air from Sorong to Makassar September 6th 2018. Check in was a little chaotic and it only opens two hours prior to flight departure however after checking in I was able to go the lounge. The lounge is pretty basic however there were snacks available and there was a good WiFi connection. The flight itself was on schedule and the onboard cabin crew were very attentive. The meal provided was good and tasty as was the service. After arrival in Sorong my baggage was ready to collect within 5 minutes of me arriving in baggage area which I consider excellent. Overall I was very satisfied with the services that Sriwijaya Air provided on this flight.
I booked a flight and one day before they cancelled the flight. I went to several offices of Sriwijaya but they told I have to go to the booking intermediate. They tell me that the company did not refund it. It was 4 months ago and I still dont have my money back. Never book a ticket with them they take your money and never do any refunds.
I booked FlyNas since it is the only airline offering a direct flight between Vienna and Riyadh. 5 hours is all it takes and I booked their premium class. What FlyNas delivered is best described as sad Time of our flight moved forward by 40 minutes without notice. Check in in T3 but boarding in T1. Flight went first to Salzburg for a 50 min stop and to offload and load passengers while arguing with ground staff on missed safety issues. Seats in premium cabin are very uncomfortable and identical to Economy. Waste of money. Cabin was freezing no blankets available. Seats recline enough for a 1 hour flight but not a 7 hour plus journey. No power sockets. First 2 sets of overhead bins on either side of the cabin are reserved and used for crew luggage. Crew could not care less where passengers paying premium prices store their Hand luggage. Food in its presentation selection and quality was dismal. 1 bottle of water offered during 8 hours in the aircraft. Crew did not ask once if they could possibly be of help. No hand towels in the toilet. Of course neither screens nor wifi. The 5 hour journey started at 1000 at Vienna Airport and ended at 2000 in Riyadh.
We were booked in on seat numbers 62j to 62k as a family of four. At the time of the meals when requested for a chicken meal we were only offered an option of fish or vegetarian. As there was no chicken available my kids were given a fish meal that they could not eat. I refused a meal as I was unable to get a chicken meal. What I was given to understand by the head stewardess that there were not enough meals on the flight. What baffles me is how can the earlier economy seats in the plain get what they want and we as a family in the latter half were not even given one chicken meal. No where on checkin were we given an option to choose our meals too. Even the head stewardess was of the opinion there was an issue with the allocation of meals.
Booked tickets Munich to Split with Condor. When we went to check in online were redirected to Marabu Airlines webpage. Never heard of them but ok. Online check in doesnt work ok. Got to airport 2 hours before our flight hundreds of people in the Marabu queue which is not moving. Everyone looks confused. We talked to other people waiting and it turns out many of them were there for the second day in a row and had been there hanging out for the whole pervious day waiting to fly before being sent away the evening before. After 5 hours or so the one checkin staff member made an announcement that all Marabu flights were cancelled and people should return at 9am the next morning for more information. He didnt work for either Marabu or Condor so had no further information. Need a hotel Book it yourself and try to get the money back from the airline was the advice. We go home return at 9am the following morning. Same scene as the day before. A few hours later the check in staff tell us all flights are cancelled and there will be no replacement flight. So we had to book our own alternative flight with Lufthansa. Condor customer service say we have to pursue Marabu for a refund EVEN THOUGH THEY OWN MARABU. We will NEVER book anything with Condor again. If you think this is just a onceoff bad experience have a look at Condors Facebook page. You have been warned
Tokyo Haneda to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia X. The flight was delayed by 15 mins but it has a great service very nice Flight Attendants. The flight was almost full and I was seated at row 42A the food was delicious. On the return leg the flight depart on time an arrives 45mins early. On the return flight there is this very nice FA who smiled throughout the whole flight.
Frankfurt to Cebu via Dubai. We booked through a travel agency which gave us separate bookings for every person. Online Checkin should be standard and Emirates offers it. However the Website is hard to navigate and it takes ages to load. Then two of us two out of five could not check in online. So we went to the airport and checked in the classic way. We were checking in four hours prior to departure. The first Checkin agent was really friendly but unfortunately she handed us over to a colleague who was rude. We tried to get seats near each other she said no seats available. There are hundreds of people in the queue behind us and you tell us they all have seats and you cant change it They didnt all do the online checkin because there were seperate queues. So we dont get seats near each other okay. We go to the gate and there is the next problem There is a preboarding area. They had to get us out of there two hours before departure. It was a mess. There they could suddenly magically change our seats. So ground service seems to be good or bad depending on your fortune. So the flight was normal. Legroom was okay but not outstanding. Recline of the seat wasnt working. The meal was great. IFE had a awesome choice but unfortunately there was two minutes of ads before every film. When we arrived in DXB we went to the costumer service to ask if we could get seats near each other since we were spread all over the plane. The staff was again rude and not motivated at all. She said she could not do anything for us. We got to the gate and picked up some free ice cream form Emirates That was great keep it up on the way. There was again this strange kind of first stage boarding. It was a mess. When I got my boarding pass scanned the agent told me Ive got an upgrade. Now I dont want to complain about the upgrade but why didnt they tell us at costumer service They scanned our boarding passes there and all in all three of us five go an upgrade one of which had a gluten free meal. So they have planned the upgrade in advance. If they would have told us we wouldnt have spent two hours on the floor. Onboard the Business Class was in a 232 configuration with angled flat beds. If I had paid money for this Business Class I would have been mad at myself to not have flown any other airline. The FAs were polite but not going out of there way to be polite. The meal was good. No FA passed through to take care of passengers except for the meal times. This is below standard as well as the seat. In the IFE there is the same ad as in Eco. All in all I dont recommend paying for this.
Although their flights decreased a lot due to the epidemic it had no impact on their quality service. Maybe there are fewer flights and fewer people at the airport but the staff at the checkin counter are more careful than before. Boarding is also very smooth. The seats on the plane are very comfortable. The greetings from the flight attendants make me feel great
My baggage were delayedlost and I completed a form at the airport but they did not even give me a copy or some kind of a ticket. They said they will contact me and also wrote a phone number to contact but nobody was answering. I called the 800 number but they are also of no help. Their customer care is simply useless.
I think the theoretical boarding procedures they have in place for covid are really good. Fill the plane from back to front and avoid too many people being on top of each other. The problem is that they do not to execute the boarding procedures the way they say they will and that leads to a lot of confusion. They used to have in flight meals in Economy now all they have is a snack. At the end of the flight they squeezed passengers onto a bus.
Boston to Hyderabad via Dubai. Emirates used to be good but standards have fallen. 13 hour flight from Boston to Dubai and the entertainment system did not work all the way and a few other passengers had the same issue. Preordered vegetarian food was not served and they came up with an excuse that they are running short. Quantity and quality of the food has decreased. Need to do lot of work to regain the old standards.
Its an incredible journey. Whether its from getting a boarding pass to checking in your luggage or talking about the excellent service of the flight attendants on the plane it makes you feel good. If there is a trip next time I will continue to choose China Southern Airlines.
Flew Business Class from Heathrow to Chennai. Check in was painless and went to the Terminal 5 lounge which was very busy but well stocked with refreshments food. Boarding was painless and was greeted with champagne. The pods alternately faced forwards and rearwards so choose carefully if you like a particular orientation. Seat was comfortable. Perhaps not being especially tall or wide meant there was plenty of wriggle room for me. Movie selection for me was fine I am not a regular cinema goer. TV screen was adequate although my old eyes couldve done with something slightly wider. Rounds of drinks and snacks outside meal time. Dinner was good I had a mixture of a western starter and asian main. Breakfast was ok eggs were solid bullets but everything else great. The crew were pleasant.
Frankfurt to Los Angeles via Keflavik. Baggage arrived a week later on our California tour. WOWAir does not pay During our 23day individually planned US tour my baggage did not arrive in Los Angeles or could only be delivered to Los Angeles seven days later. This was according to the airline WowAir in Boston. In this baggage were all my clothes and all the cosmetics of both of us. This led to significant disabilities and rescheduling of the individually planned round trip. WOWAir offered me instead of the required 763 expenses for clothes cosmetics medicine contact lenses increased fuel costs and parking fees only a lump sum of 25 per day. This is 137 and is just a fraction of the cost we had in addition. In doing so you plead that I can continue to use the newly purchased clothes and cosmetics at home. This is logically not possible becaus many cosmetics in the end was duplicated and could not be taken home for space and weight reasons. In addition all these purchases would not have been necessary if my suitcase had arrived properly. In USA you have to visit an eye specialist for new lenses. Even the eye specialist costs in the amount of 100 were not considered. In addition 13 calls were required to receive the case after a week in Los Angeles. I submitted a screenshot of it. But this cost assumption is denied. Just the detour from Death Valley to Los Angeles Airport cost us a whole day and is ignored by WOWAir. WOWAir employees are consciously playing against each other and sticking to their delay strategy. I have already sent a lot of information and evidence twice but they continue to be ignored. The way in which a paying passenger is handled here is extremely disrespectful. It becomes clear that WOWAir is not interested in a fair solution to the problem. Nor are you interested in customer satisfaction. This was our first and will have been our last flight with this airline.
Even though Aerolineas Argentinas has received too many complaints from customers recently my flight from Sao Paulo Brazil to Buenos Aires Argentina on March 1 2014 in Premium Economy Class was great and I have no complaints. The flight was on schedule the flight crew were polite and helpful. Aerolineas Argentinas premium economy class is the same as most US companies domestic first class. The seats are J seats very comfortable and the food in this class was also a great sandwich yoghurt and a chocolate muffin. Compared to service in the same route provided by Brazilian companies I have flown and comparing also the price Aerolineas Argentinas Premium Economy class is far better in service and mainly in seat comfort
SCLMVDSCL booked in premium economy but happily placed in the business cabin of their A320s that are used on these sectors perhaps because of my Oneworld status. LAN provided a good ontime service complete with some basic but tasty meals and wine. Emerald status which meant straightforward access to their business lounges in both Santiago and Montevideo and use of wifi etc. My only complaint was that as Im not much good with Spanish it was occasionally difficult to follow what the flight attendants were asking. As they are part of Oneworld they will be getting more and more nonlocal speakers on board so they should focus on language skills even on regional and local routes. Otherwise quite a good experience.
London Heathrow to Copenhagen. My first time experiencing British Airways buyonboard service. This must be brand suicide at its worst. How BA can go from a fullservice carrier to low cost overnight is astounding. The brand is now cheapened the offering before wasnt gourmet but at least you could pass the time with a tea and biscuit now you cant even get hot water for free. Even SAS offer a complimentary coffee. What ceases to amaze me is more and more is taken away by British Airways in every single class you travel yet you dont see a decrease in ticket prices. The positives to this flight were that it was on time and the crew were friendly but I do feel it must be a complete embarrassment for them.
Atlanta to Nairobi via Istanbul. My experience begun with trying to book a reservation on the company portal on 4th November currently having a choice of 2 systems. Between dodging the prompt on whether you want to use old version or new version I struggled to reserve a round trip from Atlanta to Nairobi 19th November 7 2017 return 27th December 2017 only to discover minutes later when going to print off ticket that it was wrong The information was captured inaccurately I just had one way ticket that was outbound with my return date on it. Confident that this is an easy fix after years of travelling with other gulf region airlines I immediately reach out to the Sales Office in Atlanta which rings endlessly without any answers. Very surprised but again in good faith reached out to the call center number provided. This was a nightmare the first agent could barely speak English and any attempt to get the name was met with callous response of why are you calling. Speaking very slowly and clearly as it was obvious there was minimal comprehension agent also confirming he could not understand leaving me very confused I patiently informed of the situation explaining that I was looking for a round trip ticket but believed there was a technical issue as screens kept switching between 2 versions on the portal. Eventually I was transferred to another department which I was informed would resolve the issue and unprofessionally transferred. I had to go through the same process. On the 6th when calling in for a status as I tried to review the issue to the first agent she told me she doesnt have to talk to me if I was calling for a status and I had to persist that she could not treat customers that way. This was the first time ever to attempt to use Turkish Airline and it is quite a rude shock. Eventually I was transferred to another department to an incoherent agent who sarcastically informed me that I could call back to speak to a more articulate agent. Not believing a corporation like this does not have people who could comprehend the issue I made another attempt to call back and request to speak with a manager and explain that I needed a resolution with my primary goal is to get the correct ticket that I reserved as I still intended to take the trip. I persevered the same call process all over again and this time found an agent more coherent and a little patient only for him to tell me they had emailed me a response and that my request was denied. When I sought for clarification or a manager he informed me that there are no managers there and he read a script out. This is very disturbing theres no professional etiquette to this cycle of events even more so my issue has not been addressed. It seems to be more about the money than customer satisfaction. My trip is about 50 hours away but I have the wrong ticket and no resolve. I have never experienced such a service in my many years of travel. I am hoping management will actually resolve the issue and not just respond without addressing the concern. I shudder at the thought of what lays ahead in the flight if this is the type of service they have before you even travel.
I fly the POS to LGW route on a fairly regular basis and the punctuality of the flight is bad. I suffered two 6 hour delays within 5 weeks on this route. The air steward wasnt friendly at all and was borderline aggressive when asking passengers to take a seat when the fasten seatbelt sign was switched on. The inflight entertainment needs updating. The screens are small and the resolution low. The seats were not comfortable either and you can feel every movement of the passenger which is sat behind you whenever they reached for something in the seat pocket.
Managed to get upper deck which is rare flying from London to Philadelphia. Cabin was unclean with earbuds and paper on floor from previous flight. No hello for Gold status. It became clear British Airways are some sort of work to rule. One stewardess for all upstairs. Three hours to serve dinner which was bland and tasteless. Cabin Service Director never appeared once despite my TV screen refusing to stay in open position. Never ever again will I pay thousands of pounds for bland insulting service.
Berlin to Brussels. I bought Economy Check Go ticket for about 99 EUR 112019 and wont expect too much service for this fare. Efficiency during boarding was messy and not so efficient at all. This cause this flight with a EOBT delay of 20 min but arrived a little bit late in Berlin TXL. The staff friendliness was average. Food and beverage can only be bought during the flight similar service as Ryanair but there was a large variety of Belgian cold and hot dishes. My final verdict this airline require some improvements especially during embarkment.
My trip is scheduled for 97 and the airline sent me a schedule change for a date that passed months ago 52520 I got the email of the change on 82520. I originally booked this flight with Priceline but due to Covid I ended up having to make adjustments directly with the airline Interjet. I called Priceline to see if they could help me with the email received from Interjet and they informed me my flight was canceled but I would need to work directly with Interjet as they are not able to help me. I have been calling Interjet all week and no answer at all. I am stuck
Singapore to Delhi. Bid for an upgrade so was thrilled it had been accepted. What an experience. My seat was 94A a beautiful comfortable seat. My wonderful FA Celestine looked after me so well. The food was special but I stopped at the third course. The turbulence was a little harsh so my bed was made for me to nap. I was offered camomile tea. This was an experience Ill never forget. I have flown business before a few times but experienced nothing like this level of comfort and care. Just wowed me.
Frankfurt to Shanghai via Taipei. Checkin was extremely quick and the staff very friendly. The departure was on time. The seat spacing is average in an international comparison. The onboard catering is very good and very extensive. The beverage service leaves nothing to be desired. Aircraft cleanliness contributed to wellbeing. Overall a good experience. The Inflight Entertainment offered relatively new and a lot of films.
On a recent trip to Argentina I flew with Aerolineas Argentinas several times on domestic trips. I was pleasantly surprised. The aircrafts were well maintained and all flights were on time.
Irkutsk to Incheon. I enjoyed the inflight entertainment and the seat comfort. The food was delicious and I had a great time. I was on a short flight and the legroom was amazing I would highly recommend this airline.
Tel Aviv to Heathrow with British Airways. Another good flight. IFE much improved. Tasty food served promptly with plenty of drinks. Seats not great as usual but not so important on a relatively short flight. Friendly and efficient cabin crew. Flight was 25 mins early at Heathrow which is always a bonus. Only downside was slow check in faff at Tel Aviv.
Manchester to Bangkok via Doha. I cant think of any other airlines that match the standards of Qatar Airways. Excellent checkin facilities at Manchester Qatar dont have their own lounge here and use the Escape lounge which isnt the best as now theyve merged the business class and normal lounge so its crowded and noisy but very helpful staff. Since I originally booked Qatar changed the transit time in Doha and the aircraft on both legs of the journey Manchester to Doha is now a Boeing 787 an improvement on the A330 but Doha to Bangkok is now a Boeing 777 which isnt up to the standard of the A380. However once onboard its the service that matters not the aircraft and this is where Qatar excels. The flight attendants are helpful and attentive the food is probably the best youll get on a flight the entertainment is good with a choice of movies to suit most tastes. The 787 is a fine aircraft however I found the seats in business slightly uncomfortable probably due to being 65 as the end of the seat was halfway down the back of my thighs and I needed to recline the seat. The 777 feels old now compared to the 787 and A380 the business cabin seems cramped due to the 2x2x2 layout. All flights arrived early despite one being delayed due to some passengers in economy wanting to pick were they wanted to sit rather than were they were allocated. Ground staff in Bangkok also excellent Qatar Airways will soon have their own lounge there rather than use the Thai lounge. Any negatives only that I seem to have lost my privilege club silver status have to check my points. ASKED TICKET
Flight XY 213 experienced a delay of two hours during which no representatives from the airline were present to communicate the underlying causes for the delay. The notice regarding the departure alteration was disseminated at 6pm thereby dissociating the delay from any issues pertaining to the aircrafts late arrival. Evidently the crews lack of transparency resulted in personal discomfort and undermined my confidence in the airline. Furthermore it is noteworthy to mention that when attempting to provide feedback via the survey the response failed to be recorded. This occurrence not only proved highly frustrating but also fell short of acceptable standards. Overall the combination of the delayed flight the absence of staff communication and the inability to register my feedback has greatly disappointed me eroding my trust in the airline.
Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne via Bali. I have flown with Malindo several times in the past and always thought of them as a good intermediate airline that represented value for the money. Not as cheap as Air Asia and not as expensive as Malaysia Airlines. Their food was OK there was a free baggage allowance and the seating and legroom are slightly more generous than some. My recent experience however was diabolically bad. It started at the checkin where I was told that I would have to pay over AUD 300 if I wanted to take my suitcase because I had not booked it online. So I was forced to leave it behind at the train station in a locker. Then there was the meal which had suffered a huge quality drop off. The transit at Bali required 2 bus trips from the plane to the terminal and back not to mention a massive walk from one end of the complex to the other and back. Regrettably they now go the bottom of my list and are the airline of last resort.
August 28 2019 I was traveling with my disabled stepmother and a child with scoliosis from Athens Greece to Malta AZ 717 with a change in Rome flight AZ 884. The flight from Athens to Rome was delayed 2 hours and as a result we missed our connection flight AZ884 from Rome to Malta and had to spend 9 hours 40 minutes in Rome instead of 2 hours 25 minutes. The explanation I got when I complained about such a huge unexpected layover in Rome from Alitalia was Our records show flight AZ717 was delayed due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft due to crew rest. Under EU Regulation EC 2612004 Art. 5.3 and Recital 14 the carrier does not assume liability when flights are delayed due to extraordinary circumstances. What extraordinary circumstances Earthquake Tornado Wind Rain cats and dogs so the other Alitalia flight was so delayed that the crew had to rest I do not recall any of the abovementioned disasters happening. Or it is just a conspiracy way to trick customer for not reimbursinghelpingaccommodating them when most likely the delay happened because of the technical issues with the planes and it is Alitalia fault for which they should answer Continuation Upon arrival to Rome We we not offered help for a disabled person it is quite difficult to sit in the chair for 9 hours 40 min neither phone call no food coupons as required by Under EU Regulation EC 2612004 Art. 5.3 and Recital 14 though we talked to the representatives in the disabled lounge upon arrival in Rome asking what we could be offered to help us go through the 9 hours plus of the delay Just to mention I paid higher price for the tickets to spend as little time during the layover as possible and ended up with 9 hours. To help my child with scoliosis and disabled stepmother go though this horrible not planned delay I purchased 2 entry passes 50.00 USD each to the business class lounge assuming that would solve two problems food and provide comfort in seatinglaying flat in the lounge for two sick persons. If I were to go to the restaurants to feed all three of us I am sure during 9 hours 40 minutes layover we will spend way more then 100.00 combined and I do not even ask to reimburse anything for myself. Of course I complained about the delay and applied for 100.00 USD paid for the 2 passes only 2 not 3. And here is the answer I received from Alitalia depending on the length of the delay the airline is required to provide the necessary care and assistance as phone call meals and refreshments or reimburse the expenses for meals and beverages based on the relevant receipts. However we regret to advise that the complimentary access to VIP lounges is not subject to this provision therefore we are not able to refund the lounge access you purchased at Rome airport. Looks like Alitalia does not care about its passengers at all only about filling its pockets. Next Before the flight In Athens I tried to pay for excess weight online but the Alitalia website got frozen all the time when I got to the point when I was supposed to pay. I was constantly trying for a few hours but could not pay the internet price 28.00 USD per bag versus what I had to pay in the airport 50 USD.
Flight to Cancun cabin premium. Evening check in of baggage at LGW is helpful if staying overnight at the airport and was easily done. As part of their premium package they include premium security passes and lounge access security was quick the No 1 traveller lounge was busy but fine for quick snack. The aircraft was only 4 months old so was clean and well presented. Welcome drinks offered shortly after priority boarding and Rituals amenity pack handed out. On time departure. The inflight service as a whole was very good bar service after take off and menu choices taken crew very attentive with a real can do attitude. The first meal was nicely presented with main course brought out separately after started finished. Good inflight movies etc and regular bar services during flight for those that wanted it. A tasty afternoon tea was served prior to landing with sandwiches Victoria sponge cake and sconeroddas clotted cream. The first officer made announcements during the flight which being both a day and leisure flight was a nice touch. Baggage off belt quickly. A very good flight. I have to conclude by saying that holding a high tier status with our flag carrier they were the alternative consideration. However having flown with them regularly they would not have emulated the service TUI provided in their premium economy cabin and a 20 year old 777 would have struggled to compete with the Dreamliner
Hannover LHR. What a miserable experience this was. This return ticket was 950 for a total of about 140 mins flying time. I checked in online and there was considerable delays on this as there was following a phone call back to the UK an equipment change from an A319 to an A320. Anyway I checked in online eventually and made my way through security. I asked an information post as to where the Club Business class lounge was and I was told it was land side and between this terminal and the next terminal. I could not believe it. Surely a simple prompt online when checking in could have told me this. Flight left on time a reasonable light lunch and three Gin and Tonics later we got stacked over the East End for 25 minutes but landed ahead of schedule. A miserable experience from the so called worlds favorite airline.
Having spent 4 days of my holiday in Bangkok Phuket Hospital with an attack of Bronchitis I was pleased to be returning once again to Singapore. Whilst at Phuket I arranged and paid for a wheelchair to be provided and the service I received from the staff at Phuket Airport was excellent. I was assured that a wheelchair would be awaiting me upon my arrival at Changi. Unfortunately when we landed there was no wheelchair to be seen. A female member of the cabin crew ran off to find the chair whilst I hobbled as best I could. Half way to arrivals I met the cabin crew member now running the other way with the chair which she helped me into and another passenger then took over and wheeled me right through to the baggage area.
Very poor service at LAX from Air Tahiti staff. Flying business class on AA with a code share. They are having some dispute with AA so AA and Air Tahiti are refusing to let each others business class passengers into their lounges but they dont tell you until you get to the lounge. With three small children and already on flights for 12 hours with a 6 hour stopover in LAX they refused us entry to the Lounge. The staff in the Lounge were kind. Air Tahiti wouldnt let us pay for the lounge without first going out of security again waiting 30 minutes for them to process the payment and receipts and then line up in security all over. Apparently they used to let people phone in the credit card number to avoid having to exit security but now they have decided they rather make passengers spend over an hour at their desksecurity. Well avoid Air Tahiti and AA for a long time.
Johannesburg to London . For supper I asked for warm hot water to make milky drink as I dont drink tea or coffee for health reasons. Given with no problems. For breakfast I requested the same and I was refused. I explained I dont drink tea or coffee but milk and water. We dont keep hot water I can get it once we have finished serving all other customers. That never came until the lady had to be called to take care of the unwell passenger. I kept my sugar milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays after breakfast for the warm water explaining I have been waiting. He said he will bring it in 5 seconds and he never came back. I felt like a nuisance deliberately ignored and couldnt bother anyone and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing.
This is the worst airline experience Ive ever had. I saw a poster for Breeze in the Provo airport. I have flown on Allegiant many times between Provo and Phoenix for work but no flight was available on my desired day of travel so I decided to give them a try. The actual flight was fine on time very clean new plane no bells and whistles but I didnt expect any even though I paid 200 for a one way ticket including paying for my checked bag. And here becomes the issue. I spent over an hour in Phoenix baggage claim and my suitcase never showed up. Happens right Not like this. There is no one at a ticket counter no one in baggage claim NO ONE TO CALL. Thats right they do not speak to their passengers by phone. My options to locate my bag were text email or Facebook messenger seriously. I would never have flown an airline that doesnt provide customer service by phone had I known. I sent an email and text only to receive an automatic reply to please allow up to TWO WEEKS for a response. WHAT I paid to check this bag and they lost it after an hour long flight and now I cant contact anyone to find it. Its so upsetting and appalling. As I began to inventory the lost items my panic frustration and nausea grew. I have sent messages daily for the last five days finally received an email with a lost bag claim number no apology no recourse the email said I could text to ask about reimbursement to the number I already texted with no response. How can a business treat its customers like this I dont get it. I have worked in hospitality for 25 years and this is just dumbfounding. What about brand loyalty Repeat customers Not if they dont care enough to have someone answer the phone when losing their personal property The worst part staff in the departing arrival and flight continuing airports have all told me that this happens all the time. They see people wander around baggage claim and then begin to realize their bags are gone and theres no one to talk to no one who cares. Ive had substantially better treatment from the airport information desk than the airline I paid to entrust with my bag. Dont fly this airline. The economy price is even that cheap and they dont deserve one penny of your money.
MaunJohannesburg. Short 90 min flight on what appeared to be newer BAE 146. Interior had nice leather seats and the legroom seemed quite good for economy. The flight attendants seemed indifferent almost as they were being bothered as they just plodded through the flight. The only problem with the flight was the hot cabin. I had to ask the flight attendant twice before the temperature was lowered to less than an inferno. Apparently on the BAE 146 the cockpit controls the cabin temperature not the cabin crew.
We had booked meet and assist support for our Autistic son it was such a relief for us and him to have been supported so kindly throughout the flight process He was checked on throughout the flights escorted to lounge and collected for boarding Brilliant care and support Thank you
Angry disappointed and unsatisfied. My route was from London to Atlanta. My suitcase was not boarded therefore not landed with me. For both comfort and safety reason a bag always fly with its passenger and that did not happen. Claims and few phone calls were made by desk assistants who answered my questions unprofessionally and miserably. Certainly I was left with nothing but my backpack which contained not more than few snacks. Neither clothes nor anything else was ever provided as an apology. Meanwhile I was also told that my bag would have been delivered through the next 24 hours which also did not happen. British Airways is a great airline to fly with but its organization when it comes to customer service is poor and uncertain. Still waiting for my bag.
I just finished 4 flights from Vienna to Addis Ababa and then to Kenya and then the same for the return trip. On every flight most of the screens were not working or not working properly. The staff were rude with the exception of the nice girls who were at the checkin counter in Vienna. The food was mediocre at best andseats are uncomfortable. I offered to pay for an upgrade on both the longer flights when I arrived at the airport and was told it was not possible despite there being availability. Just a ridiculous cheap airline.
AmsterdamAntalyaAmsterdam. Reasonable flight capable and pleasant FAs. Legroom sufficient for me. Refreshments pricey and low quality. Passengers should be aware that this is a nonEU company and that as such the protection of rights in the event of delay cancellations and such is not applicable.
SofiaVarnaSofia several times this summer. None of the flights were on time. Average delay of 23 hrs is rather usual thing than an exception. No compensation is offered. I would try to avoid them in the future.
Basel Mulhouse to Algiers on 1903206. It was scheduled for 1450 and departed at 2006 without any explanation excuse or apology. The only representative the company had at the airport could not give any information nor provide any help to the hundreds of passengers stuck at the airport. What is even worse is that the company has no customer service to contact no telephone number and no email address. The only way to contact the company is through a form on their website to which you will never get any answer ever
We booked a ski vacation to Bulgaria and during the online booking at the official Bulgaria Air website we specifically ckecked the box indicating we would bring skis with us. On the way from Amsterdam to Sofia there was no problem to check in our skis. On the way back from Sofia however the skis were refused. We needed a special document and had to pay an additional 30 which we could obtain somewhere at the airport. If we would have followed that procedure we would have missed our flight huge lines for checkin which costed us already 40 minutes so we decided to leave the skis behind at the airport. It is amazing how they treat their customers. Complaining is useless they just keep on repeating their mantra of rules. Ridiculous that ckecking in skis in Amsterdam is no problem but on the way back they are simply refused. Dont fly this airline if you want to bring something special or want be treated as a human being.
I find it appalling that SAs flight attendants allow children seated in Economy to come visit their parents in Business. I didnt pay in excess of 5000 per ticket to be sharing the aisle with other people and be irritated by the noise produced. I was seated in 17D the person in question was in A17 his child came at night and they played loud games I was hearing the childs talking and laughing through my sleep. I believe that its not professional behavior on the part of SAs FAs and they shouldnt be allowed to place parents and minors in different classes let alone let the visitors in no matter what age. I will not be flying Singapore Airlines any longer unless this problem gets fixed.
I fly from Prague to the UK and back every week. During last few months Smartwings flights were always late always delayed by at least an hour. But the most annoying thing is that when you finally get on the plane it keeps waiting for its new departure slot during this time the AC is off so it is too hot and very uncomfortable. Because of this I switched to EasyJet they are more expensive but on time.
We went on vacation in an all inclusive trip to Jamaica from April 11 April 18 2022 well with the flight delays it was more like no sleep and April 19 2022. The resort was the worst one I have ever been at the people were rude the Sunwing rep onsite was never available to talk to. When flights were delayed no one informed us it was only after missing the pickup time and panicking with a family of 5 that we found out there were issues with Sunwing flights. This costed us meals stress and a day of work. I am so upset. There is so much more but this is the surface issues.
I bought a Business Class ticket between Madrid and Paris CDG on Iberia and was never told that the flight was operated by their low cost subsidiary Iberia Express. There is nothing wrong wih some Iberia affiliates Air Nostrum for instance provides one of the best regional onboard services in the world. Not so wih Iberia Express. Business Class consists of the first three rows in the A320 cabin but at a markedly reduced seat pitch compared to the main airline. The middle seat is left empty. As usual in Madrid passengers are kept waiting in the glass jetways which are absolute ovens in Spains weather. This was however the first time that upon boarding and getting in my seat 2A I was denied a glass of water by a FA who was herself drinking mineral water and replenishing her own glass while explaining to me that she could not serve anything before takeoff. First row passengers were never told to stow their hand baggage which happily remained unsecured in the middle seat. The main Iberia Business class cabin service is plain at best but its Express brand is several notches lower performed by completely uninterested FAs who literally throw flimsy trays at you. One of them missed and actually fell in the aisle where it remained for over 10 minutes. It was eventually footballed away by the young ladys shoe. Finally the worst is that Iberia Express arrives at CDG T3 the charter terminal with bus transfers long baggage waits and a trek of probably 900 meters to finally reach a smelly automatic shuttle which 5 minutes later brings you to the civilized part of the airport. This felt like Ryanair without the competence. My ticket was anything but low cost. I was not amused. Why have a Business Class those flights at all Avoid.
London Heathrow Pisa return. I fly this route often as I have a house in Tuscany. I fly British Airways Club Europe only because the FAs are better the lounge is a welcome benefit and if you book far ahead enough you can get a reasonable deal plus Avious points. That aside there is little benefits to flying say Ryanair. The trip started at T5 and the Northern lounge was not for a change to busy. Had a fruit and coffee breakfast. The options were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon baps dripping fat all over the place. Some years ago BA provided some nice scrambled eggs. Now they dont. Flight left from the A terminal and we boarded downstairs from the lounge. The plane was half full. It was clean and valeted. We pushed back 10 minutes early. My wife had a sort of brunch thing cheese and ham rolls. She said it was ok. I had a couple of Gin and Tonics. The FA said she had never seen such an empty flight and neither had I for that matter. The now chargeable food and beverages in Economy went down like a lead balloon apparently. I read the BA Brochure on the now chargeable food and as a Sales and Marketing professional It was the most patronising piece of rubbish Id ever read. It read as if BA were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of all. And goodness me the products are not cheap over a 1 for a kit kat. We landed ahead of time and has to walk the tarmac like Ryanair customers. Several years ago you had the airbridge. Now you dont. The return flight started in the shared lounge which was rammed. This in part is due to Qatar airlines operating out of Pisa and their Business Class customers use the same facility. Some booze and snacks nothing edible. Flight delayed by 30 minutes. Plane was rammed. Very pleasant FAs. Afternoon tea with horrible dried out sandwiches scones that didnt look like scones. On both flights the usual three seats with the centre seat being a table. No legroom. Hopelessly inadequate product which can be as high as 600 return. Docked at the B terminal and had to walk miles to the trains that took us back to T5Terminal A. All in all another disappointing experience from the Worlds most frugal Airline.
Beijing to Melbourne via Haikou. Wonderful 5star experience travelling with family and young children. Checkin at Beijing airport was smooth and quick and the through checkin facility for our luggage to Melbourne was a nice surprise. Domestic 3hour flight on Boeing 787 from Beijing to Haikou exceeded expectations with ontime departure spacious seats full inflight entertainment tasty fullservice lunch served including childrens meal and early arrival at Haikou. Through checkin allowed us to transfer easily to international terminal. International flight on A330 from Haikou to Melbourne was also great with friendly cabin crew full dinner and breakfast served and ontime arrival. Thank You Hainan Airlines for this wonderful travel experience
Our direct SAS flight to be operated by Cimber from Vilnius to Copenhagen had been cancelled so SAS rerouted us through Stockholm. The airlines between Vilnius and Stockholm turned out to be Air Nostrum. Seat pitch was the same as with SAS. Cabin staff did not speak any Scandinavian language nor Lithuanian so announcements including security instructions were carried out in Spanish and English and my wife and I didnt understand. Onboard we wanted to purchase some items such as sparkling water and a sandwich. The purser then told that none of the goods from the menu card could be purchased. I thought that it was an SAS flight operated by another airline and I actually expected SAS service. However the only reaction to this was that they couldnt do anything because this was Air Nostrum. I then argued that it said SAS on the ticket and even the SAS logo was painted on the tail wing but also this didnt seem to bother the purser at all. She said that all foodbeverage services were only for business class. When my wife made it clear that if she actually did get sick during the flight the cabin staff would have a problem the purser got my wife sparkling water.
Singapore to London Heathrow with Singapore Airlines. We ordered gluten free meals which were good. However in a 13.5 hour flight other than fruit that was all we were given until I complained. There are 9 hours between the two main meals. Fruit is not enough. We are both hypoglycaemic and need some form of carbohydrates. There was nothing. We were told we need to bring our own snacks. Everyone else had the option of sandwiches and muffins. None of which was available gluten free. Not good enough
Flight on time nice crew on the plane very comfortable seat and great food. Snacks and beverages served during my 6 hour flight. The entertainment system screen was big but with not a lot of TV shows and movies. Everything was perfect even the arrival was great.
Flew Air Austral return Sydney to Mauritius. Male flight attendants on the flight to RUN nice however food provided is limited and alcohol only during meal times. Water is in short supply and passengers at the back of the plane were forgotten about almost all the time and rationing of water became an issue towards the end of the journey. Passengers were made to stay overnight in RUN hotel stay provided to some passengers were terrible no assistance from the airline or hotel and dinner not provided incur at passengers expense. Return flight home was canceled with no word to most passengers only upon checkin. Flight was canceled due to poor maintenance of the plane which suffered system difficulties on its previous long haul journey and was forced to attempt emergency landing 3 times and we were going to take this plane home Was put up again at the same terrible hotel for the night. Female flight attendants extremely rude impatient and unwilling to communicate to passengers who cannot speak fluently in French. Very disappointed in the service provided by Air Austral will not fly again.
Istanbul to Cape Town via Doha. First leg was full on an A330 from Istanbul to Doha. First thing that was obvious was that this was an old plane. The seats looked like they had seen better days and the in flight screens were not touched and had to be controlled by hand held devices in the arm rest. On top of this many screens were not working and people requested to have a reset. The crew were polite and the cabin senior from Bangladesh was the most outstanding crew member I have had in a while. He was older wiser and had a knack for making me feel at home given the old plane and a poor inflight entertainment options. The meals were ok but the plastic containers look cheap and tacky and serving tea in paper cups seems like the cheap way out. The flight was on time and we arrived at gate before scheduled arrival. The onward leg to Cape Town was in the Boeing 787. I get the impression that at Hamad all flights from Doha to the developing world have to be subjected to the c2027 gates which means being bused to a remote standing aircraft. I have experienced this before at Hamad. For elderly passengers this remote stand departures are a severe inconvenience. Boeing 787 seemed new the inflight entertainment worked a charm and the cabin crew on this flight were wonderful. The meals were again just ok but I slept and thus just picked on the food. These were sale flights I booked and I dont know whether I would fly them again.
Third class service. They are rescheduling flight timing multiple times. Better option train or bus services or another flights not Go First. very disappointing. I will never prefer this flight.
Flew RGNSNW arrived at the Yangon Domestic Terminal an hour and a half ahead of the flight. Checkin was smooth received my passenger identification sticker and waited in the restaurant. Boarding was via a bus from the gate to the aircraft. The plane was an ATR72 and seating was done quickly. Flight was full. Aircraft left on time and boxed refreshments and teacoffee were served soon after the seatbelt signs went off after takeoff by wellpresented aircrew. Flight arrived on time and on disembarking after clearing immigration received my bag within half an hour and was out of the airport. Return flight SNWRGN was slightly less orderly with three Air KBZ flights leaving within 45 minutes of each other. Seating area was full in the lower floor of the departure terminal so went up to the top floor and sat out on the deck to watch the planes landing from the seaward direction. Once on board the ATR72 flight was smooth again received a box with sweet buns and boxed juice in and teacoffee served. Flight arrived on time again and bags were slightly delayed at Yangon. I was impressed with the service throughout and would fly again.
London Heathrow to Vancouver. The 747 on this route is an old worn out aircraft even though I paid for premium economy the seat was hard small and uncomfortable it would not recline without the air stewardess yanking the seat back the front foot rest was broken on one side so that during the whole flight my foot was tilted and slid off. The touch on the back of the screen was small difficult to see and barely working. The washroom had a leak and when I used it in the middle of the flight water was running along the floor and soaked my socks the air stewardess just gave a small laugh and said I shouldnt have worn socks. There was no accessory pack of eye shades etc out of two meal choices one had run out after two rows had been served. The crew appeared bored and not bothered.
I made a payment to Flight Center for a vacation booked through Sunwing on the 10th March 2020. I inquired with my travel agent about what would happen if we could not travel due to COVID19 on the 14th March the possible refund options the process etc. I requested to know the process for refunds from my travel agent on 16th and 17th March. On 17 March I saw that Sunwing per their website which I have screenshots of was suspending all southbound flights after clicking the link I saw that customers travelling between 17 March and 9 April could either choose to be refunded in the form of future travel vouchers OR request a full refund to the original payment method credit card. After reading the above policy on the Sunwing site I emailed my travel agent to request a cancellation of my vacation and the full refund to the original payment method I also emailed her the screenshots of the above mentioned policy. On the 18th of March I received confirmation from my travel agent that the cancellation request had been processed and that I would receive a full refund to my original payment method in roughly 3 weeks. On the 31st March I received an email from my travel agent stating that Sunwings policy had changed and that I was not longer going to be receiving a refund to the original payment method as originally requested and confirmed but would instead receive future travel vouchers valid for 24 months. I reached out to both my travel agent and Sunwing who both stated that I would not be able to get the refund as promised and that there was nothing they could do to help me recover those funds.
Worst Airline for travel in my experience. I booked my ticket way in advance for my engagement and on the day Im at the airport and only to find out they dont start working until 12 midday. Then there was an issue with my flight which I still dont know what the issue was and my flight was delayed. I told them I have a connecting flight and was planning my engagement where friends were waiting on me. They couldnt guarantee me my flight for that time so I had to cancel the engagement. They are now telling me that Im not eligible for reimbursement.
I enjoyed my flight aboard Air Zimbabwe from Harare to Johannesburg the crew were very friendly and the service was excellent. We arrived ahead of schedule checkin was fast and smooth and the seats were comfortable.
Seattle to London Heathrow. The British Airways Lounge at Seattle is very poor for starters with old lounge seats which are stained and give the impression its still the 1990s. Plane was half full as it was Thanksgiving Day so that made for a nice relaxed flight. No real complaints as the seats in business class are private and comfortable for sleeping although the meal quality left a little to be desired. Woke just over an hour before landing and was served a bowl of cereal. No juice fruit etc. and had to ask for the main dish which the crew seemed reluctant to provide and when they did was just handed to me without anything else. Glad this ticket was on miles. Value for money rating below is given on basis that it was a revenue ticket.
I flew New York to Doha return on an A350 in Business Class in late October. The plane is quite new and the business cabin is spacious and airy. There are no overhead bins over center seats giving the 121 configured cabin a sense of spaciousness. The seats were truly excellent spacious with plenty of nooks and crannies to store things and with an excellent entertainment system. All of the hardware was truly first rate which made the lessthanstellar softproduct all the more disappointing. The drawback to the seat configuration is that people travelling together in the center are so far apart that its hard to converse in a low tone of voice. The food was quite tasty and nicely presented. The cabin attendants did their jobs and nothing more. The service was polite perfunctory and when they finished they disappeared behind the galley curtains. So much so that some children who got bored started racing around the cabin bumping into seats waking up their occupants and then when they tired of that they started taking out the life vests and playing with them. It was literally hours before one of the cabin attendants stumbled upon half a dozen life vests strewn on the floor. If there had been an emergency those vests would have been needed. The cabin attendant merely picked them up and took them with him behind the curtain. The wifi was terrible on both flights. Frequently out of signal and when there was signal the speed was atrocious. Barely enough to send and receive emails without attachments. The lavatories were not always maintained to good standard. Overall the experience was not bad but t was just not particularly great.
Just returned from a weekend in Amsterdam flying out of London City Airport. Flight was fine for a short flight and the location of City airport was convenient. Was disappointed by how they handled the large volume of cabin trolley cases on both outward and return flights. On the way out of London nothing was said until my friend and I boarded the plane and there was no space left in the overhead lockers for our trolley cases both of which were standard cabin size. This was the case for a number of passengers and it was inconvenient as we were told that we had to take them to the front of the plane for them to be put in the hold which caused difficulties as passengers were trying to get down the aisle in opposing directions. On the return flight out of Schipol as we queued at the gate to get on the plane they saw that about 1012 of the passengers at the front of the queue including us and told us that we would have to hand our baggage in to be placed in the hold. What bothered me was that after we took our seats we saw people coming onto the place after us who had trolley cases bigger than ours so it seemed unfair that some of the passengers were treated differently.
ARNVBYARN soldmarketed under Gotlandsflyg but operated by Nextjet which claims to be Swedens largest regional airline. The Visby flights were operated by a Saab 340 and load was about 3040 in the offseason. Rather exorbitant prices if booked through the website as much as 150200 OW cheaper if booked through Gotlandsflyg and cheapest if booked at the airport on a standby price. Onboard service is nonexistent no drinks everything for sale. Magazines of both Nextjet and Gotlandsflyg in the seatback pockets BOB in both listed as cardonly but flight attendant only takes cash and offerings are completely different though good quality and cheap. Late on the outbound early on the inbound with poor service this airline left a lot to be desired.
I had a terrible experience with these guys. Flight came 4 hours due to medical emergency as they said we understood but they didnt carry none of our luggage. Whole passengers arrived at destination without luggage. It took 3 days to get out luggage that too we were helped by our friends working in Abu Dhabi airport. No Air Arabia staff showed up or came for help. The only response was from call centres we called they were asking to email Air Arabia but ended up receiving your situation is handled. Really disappointing service.
SZBSIN return. Considering the promotional fares the convenience of Subang Airport as well as the impeccable service for a 70 minutes flight light snack Firefly is an excellent option.
My last few experiences with British Airways have been extremely disappointing they just do not offer the level of service that customers used to enjoy. On my most recent trip from London to Toulouse I booked using my Avios points. I then had to cancel the outward trip for personal reasons and was charged extra to do so so I ended up spending more on 1 flight than I had for 2. They now charge for food and drink on shorthaul flights I even had to purchase a bottle of water. This is akin to a LCC such as Easyjet but the fares are still much more expensive. In addition I received an email from the airline saying they had tried to contact me and could I contact British Airways about my booking. I had received one missed call with no message during working hours. Having eventually dug out the right customer services number these were not provided on the email I tried several time to get through on but was left waiting so long I eventually gave up.
London to Miami return. Flew out with 5 children one was an infant turning 2 during holiday. Had necessary booking for seat on return and booking number and email assuring me bookings were linked and there would be no issue. Upon checking in to return was met with rude staff who commented dont even touch that its hassle just refer her to ticketing where I spent the next two hours waiting for them to check me in. My flight closed and took off without me despite me constantly stressing that I had a child with a fractured leg and medical assistance all linked to the flight. Long story short I was dumped on next flight after 3 hours waiting at desk with 5 children no explanation of what was going on people being served all around me by person who was supposed to be dealing with me no child meals were transferred and all assistance was abandoned as was connected with previous flight. Resulted in me being stranded at Heathrow as my 7 seater taxi had left and was impossible to book another. However this wasnt all check in staff went on to tell me that my 32 kilo case could not be boarded as it was too heavy under health and safety regulations. I had to throw away 8 kilos worth of clothing. This was despite me being 48 kilos under my overall baggage allowance and receiving a sticker labelled heavy bags must not weigh more than 32 kilos. Had a further 3 hour wait at the other end as all medical assistance booked had not been transferred as requested. Would never fly British Airways again due to the complete and utter incompetence of the ground staff at Miami.
Vancouver to Medellin via Mexico City. When I checked in at YVR Vancouver I thought how strange that checkin employee was really dry and rude. He barely spoke to me at all and looked like he was just having a bad day. Little did I know that would be the general mood Id find in every Interjet employee going forward. When I arrived at home after 2 days of travel I was notified that the airline had left my suitcase with every piece of clothing I had that wasnt on my body. I was told that if it took longer than 48 hours to get to my door Id get compensation because Id clearly have to get new clothing. They took over a month to respond to my request for compensation saying it wasnt their responsibility. I have yet to fly with an airline that cares so little about their clients. I am done with them and wouldnt recommend them to my worst enemy.
The planes are old dirty and poorly maintained. Staff are very unfriendly never even said hello or goodbye both times I flew with them ToronotVaraderoToronto. The back of my seat was broken. There was about a 1.5 hr delay each way with no announcements or explanations. Zero entertainment. The only positive was that they did serve the food although it was pretty awful continental breakfast variety.
Paris Orly to Montreal return. The business class fare classe Grand Large is less than 13 of that of a regular carrier. Ok the seats only recline to 130 degrees but the 222 configuration of their brand new A330 is definitely better than the 232 which Air France provide in their B777 Excellent food and drinks wide choice of entertainment courteous friendly and efficient service who could ask for more The only slight disappointment was the badly designed footrest which does not make much of a difference. All in all a very pleasant experience.
We booked Air New Zealand London to Papeete via Los Angeles. Flights from Los Angeles to Papeete are operated by Air Tahiti Nui. What surprised us that we were asked to check in at Papeete the proof of our flights Los Angeles to London while the flight was made in codeshare with Air New Zealand. No online check in was possible no seats were available by calling 72 hours before but by miracle they were available at check in after getting the check in manager to assist. We kept our original seats. There is a limit to stupid systems. In short an experience not to be renewed on Air Tahiti Nui. If this airline did not have the exclusivity on Papeete they would have disappeared a long time ago. Nous avons fait une reservation Air New Zealand Londres Papeete via Los Angeles. Les vols Los Angeles Papeete etant effectue par votre compagnie. Quelle ne fut pas notre surprise quon nous demande a lenregistrement a Papeete la preuve de nos vols Los Angeles Londres alors que le vol etait effectue en codeshare avec Air New Zealand... Pas denregistrement en ligne possible pas de places disponibles hublot en appelant 72 heures avant mais par miracle il y en avait de disponible au check in apres avoir fait venir la responsable du check in. Nous avons garde nos places dorigine. Il y a une limite a la betise. Bref une experience a ne pas renouveller sur Air Tahiti Nui. Si vous naviez pas lexclusivite sur Papeete vous auriez disparu depuis bien longtemps.
Flight from Jakarta Halim Perdana Kusuma to Semarang. Booked this airline due to the airport being located in Jakarta city centre Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport HLP. Airline changed the departure time without notification I realized the delay through the web checkin and asked their call centre to confirm it. The checkin process was chaotic as they only have two counters open for 5 different flights. The baggage handling was OK for low cost airlines. The cabin looks good and clean. The cabin crew were helpful and polite. I sat on the seat 31A limited space and limited recline. The flight was good. For value of money and quality I recommed to fly with this airlines for short flights 12 hours flight.
Skymark is a lowfare airline in Japan. I flow from Tokyo Haneda to Fukuoka. The crew are very friendly and polite but cannot speak fluent English. The B767300 is clean but I am very disappointed with their seats. The seats are very cramped and it is nearly impossible to move out from the seat with the configuration of 242. Although seats are narrow the price is extremely competitive.
Paris to Prague. First of all the passengers are checked for size and weight of cabin bags before security control. The flight was on time we received small sandwich and a beverage crew was nice. There was a wifi with free message pass which is great. However after arrival I found out that my cabin bag which I was forced to checkin came ripped which is unacceptable.
Having had our fight cancelled from Shannon on the 19th Nov 2022 we flew from Dublin the following day. Aer Lingus were very good about the cancellation and looked after us well though communication was not great following the cancelled flight. The cabin crew served the most awful food I have ever had on a flight. The chicken meal I asked for was only lukewarm and since I didnt want to risk being ill on my holiday I decided not to eat it. Later they served coffee I asked a cabin crew member for sugar and he completely ignored me I assumed he didnt hear me and repeated my request he immediately said I am dealing with something in a rude and aggressive manner I was so embarrassed even the people sitting next to me remarked on him. We flew back to Ireland on the 28th October on the 18.55 flight. We got a cereal bar and orange juice for breakfast my husband asked for coffee following breakfast and was told that the captain said coffee was not to be served due to turbulence We were certainly not advised about turbulence. We will never fly Aer Lingus again if we can possibly avoid it. Terrible. The cabin crew are just awful rude and have complete disregard their captive customers
On July 10 2022 I flew Sky Airlines from Lima to Cusco. Passengers are forced to board the plane by walking on the tarmac on cold weather to be transported by bus to the plane. Seats are uncomfortable no entertainment onboard no snacks or drinks. For my trip double face masks were enforced. I was wearing only one but one flight attendant demanded me that I wore two masks instead of one. Flight crew came out rude and authoritative. Good manners would go a long way.
On Sunday February 7th 2015 my wife and I were on Cubana Flight 188 returning to Toronto from Holguin. On approach to Pearson Airport in Toronto the pilot was advised that the airport was closed and we were diverted to Montreal. All passengers behaved extremely well and took everything in stride. However once in Montreal it took over 2 hours before our luggage was made available and only after that coupons for meals and accommodation were handed out. We finally got to our hotel at 11.00 pm and had to be back at the airport at 5.00 am. The wickets were finally manned at 6.00am. All the delays were totally unnecessary and the whole procedure could have been handled in a far more expeditious and speedy manner. I repeat kudos to all passengers who despite the long waits and line ups were extremely patient.
Bangalore to Kathmandu with Nepal Airlines. Food service was good. Staff nice and polite. There was no inflight entertainment but flight was on time. Aircraft was clean. Food better than Air India and Jet Airways.
Dont bother with premium on El Al. The airline provided has no dedicated check in for premium seat holders. Premium seat holders get no preference in boarding and staff allows all upper stowage to be utilised by none premium seat holders. Took 3 hours to pass security and check in and I pre checked of no use. Worst airline ever.
Have read reviews for La Compagnie and come to the conclusion that some people are really picky. We went to New York from London for a quick weekend break so time was precious was a bit worried about comments regarding cancelled flights but apart from an hours delay leaving Luton and half an hour leaving Newark no problem. I like the fact that everyone has the same seat it made for a very egalitarian atmosphere and our fellow travellers were noticeably less tense and anxious than travellers we have encountered in the three class type of flight. Seats were very comfortable I enjoyed the elevated position in recline followed by the downward swoop into flat OK so not totally flat but around 165 degrees I would say and plenty long enough for me to stretch out comfortably. The plane was about half full so loads of extra pillows and blankets if needed to really make your nest. The staff were fab and very French I mean this in a good way. Food was excellent on both trips not sure what people have moaned about quantity as it was way too much for me on the return leg. Champagne was a good marque and the wine also of good quality. Very happy with the tablet provided. There were at least two Oscar nominated films which I had not seen and wanted to as well as other interesting items and given that I wanted to sleep on the way back plenty of entertainment for me. If the company can increase the size of its fleet it would be a nobrainer for anyone wanting to travel business class to New York. On the ground side excellent lounge in Luton. The one in Newark was less swish but perfectly adequate. Having priority clearance for security was a nice bonus and we shot through both times. Luggage collection was also very quick at both ends so all in all an excellent experience.
I booked flights for my boss and 2 colleagues with Blue Islands to fly to Jersey on Tuesday 23516 on a flight due to depart at 14.40. I booked the flights online on 27416 and checked them in online on 22516. When they arrived at London City on Tuesday they were told by airport staff that Blue Islands have changed to their summer schedule and that the 14.40 flight does not operate any longer. Not only was I able to book the flights less than a month ago I was also able to check them in online and print boarding passes for a flight that was not operating. We received no message whatsoever that the schedule had changed and in fact they are still selling this flight on their website. Ive had no response to date to any of my emails or voicemail messages left with their Customer Care department. My colleagues also informed me that there is no Blue Islands desk in London City Airport.
Ive always preferred FlySafair but not anymore. I needed to change my flight about 5 days prior but the system was down. I kept calling daily asked a friend to do this for me at the airport but got absolutely no assistance. On the day of departure at the boarding gate I was told that the gate closed a minute before I arrived and my bag was already offloaded. So offloading my bag took a minute I suppose. All this could have been avoided had I gotten help changing my flight. The staff attitude is the worst Im disappointed Definitely hoping I never have to fly with them So much for the cheapest airline now I understand why its important to pay a little extra for an exceptional service.
Hong Kong to San Francisco with Cathay Pacific. Work trip so had to take the seat offered me. I took the window seat in the emergency row bulkhead behind the wing. 777300 is a big enough plane that overall the cabin felt roomy and even elegant. Suspecting that I would be experiencing a tedious 14 hour flight I didnt have high hopes but the seat width was adequate and nobody was seated next to me. I could stretch out. Cabin crew was courteous and attentive but they didnt really seem to make much eye contact. Dont remember too many in flight announcements. Cabin overall quiet and comfortable. Plenty of good movies and games. Lots of newspapers. The only negatives I could observe were the bathrooms and the very very cold air coming out of the emergency slide door. I dont know where it comes from but it was a constant draft once we got to cruise and I had to place my backpack there to prevent getting frostbite. Disembarked very quickly and even though we were all tired it was all smiles and not much trash. Very well maintained airline.
Fortunate enough to get a real good deal for a Business Class ticket on the inaugural Wellington to Canberra flight on 21 Sept 2016. Check in was quick and efficient boarding was even quicker. Short Haul Business Class cabin in a 222 configuration very comfortable and I found it quite spacious. Cabin crew very friendly as you expect from Singapore Airlines. A little pomp and ceremony being the first every B777200 commercial flight out of Wellington the first flight between Wellington and Canberra. Flight was fairly full only a few seats left here and there. Quick take off and the service began with bubbles of course food was really tasty and restaurant quality. Cabin crew very attentive engaging and we had a few laughs along the way too. Flight was smooth lie flat bed was flat and comfortable still managed a few zzzs before landing. Seat comfort itself was great and inflight entertainment system well I didnt try it at all we were too busy having bubbles and food and laughs. Was a great flight and Singapore Airlines exceeded my expectations on this trip by far
Just back from a fantastic 2.5 week trip to Thailand flying to and from Bangkok with BA on 777 aircraft. I definitely would choose another airline next time. We flew out on 31st December 2014 and the crew were surly and inattentive. Asking for a drink seemed as if it was really putting them out. One of the crew swore when communicating with her colleague during the drinks service within ear shot of us. Outbound they run out of the the meal choice for both very small meals by the time they reached us so we had to had the veggie option. For most of the flight the crew were camped in the galley at the back seemingly having a party with colleagues whether working or not so you felt it was a imposition to ask for water or snacks. My inflight entertainment system had streaks all across which couldnt be rubbed off making the movies very hard to see. Return flight crew on 16th Jan were much less surly but again conspicuous by their absence meaning you had to try and wade through the party at the back to try and get water or snacks during the flight. Two passengers were flicking raisins about the cabin onto other passengers which might have been spotted had the cabin crew had more of a presence. The inflight entertainment system had major issues which meant it didnt work on demand making it hard to plan viewing of movies. Again 2 very small meals at the either end of a 13 hr flight with very limited options for snacks in between. One staff member said they had very little left then allowed a passenger to grab about 5 packets for herself. Tray table was broken in seat 27b also. The crew said as it was an early flight they knew we all wanted to sleep but the flight left just before midday so not what I call a night flight. I used to love flying BA as have always been impressed with their service in the past but now the planes and the crew seem tired and I am sorry to say neither my partner or I enjoyed the experience. Will look to EVA Thai or one of the Middle Eastern airlines next time.
Lisbon to Bangkok return via Dubai. First Leg of the flight happy that was on time out of Lisbon early on Dubai short connection so it was good the flight crew was fantastic on that leg. Second leg from Dubai to Bangkok I must say that I am starting to hate the A380800 many people not sufficient capacity from the crew imagine get a meal and only 45 minutes later something to drink. Second part of the journey Bangkok to Dubai with a flight coming from Hong Kong seats assigned could you imagine all dirty made me sit on them until other place was free it was really dirty in the end after some complaint got me a place on the rear of the plane at least the plane was half full so could stretch a little and sleep all the way. Final leg to Lisbon on my favorite Boeing 777 because it has a fantastic last three rows with 2 places and lots of space. I have travelled a lot by Emirates but somehow the difference to others is not that much right now going to try Qatar Airways the next trip. Not happy the service has gone down.
My flight from Calgary was delayed due to a mechanical error. I had a connection to Anchorage that I barely made due to the delay. My disappointment was that I had paid for a premium seat and they gave it away to someone else. They gave me a middle seat and told me I would have to call to get reimbursed for a credit. That is very poor customer service. Heads up the premium seats have more leg room but sit 3 across and are narrow. The inflight movie app did not work on my iPhone 6s nor did it work on my brand new lap top. I would avoid this airline in the future.
Extremely poor customer service. I have to use Saudi Airlines out of necessity rather than by choice due to the location of my work and their monopoly on the internal Saudi flights. As I will be travelling by flight frequently I decided to join the Al Fursan Loyalty Program. This took 2 months to happen as the process could never be completed and seeking assitance from the customer service was futile. By this time I had already flown 3 segments and now wish to add those flights to my account as is permissible up to 6 months post travel. 3 months later I am still trying to add these flights without success. By telephone I am advised to use the WhatsApp service the WhatsApp service doesnt respond or gives error messages I have tried sending emails I have tried submitting a complaint via the website no response from any effort. I have sought assistance from the ground staff as well as the flight staff encountered during my travels however the advice is always to contact the Unified Customer Service number or the WhatsApp service neither of which ever works. Very frustrating
My family and I flew on Garuda Indonesia on GA088 from Jakarta to Amsterdam in June 2023. On arrival at Jakarta Terminal3 the Garuda ground support team were waiting to help and assist us with our luggage and checkin. After checking in we were escorted through immigration and into the lounge. Drinks snacks and full preboarding menu was available . When it time came for boarding we were escorted to the aircraft. After takeoff the chef provided us with a very good selection of meals when the food arrived as each meal was prepared by the Chef onboard it was very well presented and tasted even better. We had two full meals onboard additionally the cabin crew were available throughout the flight offering snacks and hot and cold drinks. The FirstClass cabin is very comfortable and when it came time to sleep my family and I had a good rest. The cabin crew were very attentive to me my wife and two children. Nothing was any bother for them and they always greeted us with a reassuring heartwarming GarudaIndonesia smile. I recently read that GarudaIndonesia on June 20th 2023 was awarded the Best Cabin Crew 2023 and I would fully endorse this as they were outstanding on our flight. Therefore I would like to thank the GarudaIndonesia Cabin crew Margaretha Bernadette Mardiana Ade Kurniawan Nesyanti for their help and assistance to me and my family they certainly made us feel at home. Upon arrival in Amsterdam we were met at the plane door by the Schiphol VIP Center team which is part of Garuda Indonesia service. We transferred to the VIP lounge to await our connecting flight. WiFi is available onboard however it is expensive for 250Mb limit.
Awful experience. I basically paid money for torture. Flight was delayed indefinitely they told us no plane no pilot and I am stranded at the airport. I have wasted an entire day from my precious trip. None of the communication made by the airline thus far was satisfactory. Bottom line pay a little more such that you get an airline that will actually give you a plane. My flight and hotel money have gone to waste.
Please dont fly Eurowings. They are not consistent with any policy at all and lie to their customers. It was promised to take our bags on the plane for 50 extra but once in the plane we had to load it in cargo. They promised us it would be ok as otherwise we would miss our train and we would need to stay an extra night in Dusseldorf. They did not keep their promise. Thanks for nothing.
Tokyo to Honolulu. This trip to Hawaii I splashed out on their premium economy. It is a great value considering the services provided. You get designated checkin priority luggage check and access to the Sakura Lounge at Narita. Because it was a late night flight people like myself were eating full meals in the lounge in order to skip the late night dinner service onboard. Plenty to choose from teriyaki chicken over rice their famous beef curry over rice dim sum soup sandwiches and Thai curry were some of the choices. We also got a massage and a shower in before boarding the aircraft. Of course people did eat on board too which consisted of a posh Tokyo yoshoku chain called Shiseido Parlour and while I didnt eat anything the meals definitely looked better than your average economy meal. The seats are a little hard after 5 hours and the recline is the slide type which many people dislike but since I cant sleep on planes anyway it didnt bother me. There is ample space both in width and in leg room. The service is flawless. The AVOD was adequate. A smooth flight going over. Coming back the 787 was even better. The toilet in economy with a washlet was a welcome treat. There were two babies traveling in the front row of premium and they were treated like kings The older flight attendants doted over them the entire flight with special meals chatting games and toys and of course bassinets. The power port at my seat didnt work and the wifi on offer never seemed to either. Im now a regular with JAL and I dont think Ill be changing anytime soon.
My wife travelled this airline from Johannesburg South Africa on 14 January and had a really terrible experience. Departure was delayed by 2 hours. Connecting flight information at Frankfurt was ambiguous which meant she was not even sure of when her next flight will be or where it will be boarding. She was also served breakfast that did not meet her dietary requirements. I also was quite concerned for her safety and wellbeing. I think that this airline should not be operating. Those who consider traveling it should beware.
Shanghai to Brisbane. Overall the flight was very nice. Unfortunately bus boarding. China eastern do scan your boarding passes on the tarmac which is a bit uncomfortable considering the temperature outside in winter night. Seat pitch was ok. Meal was average same for IFE. Flight attendants were OK.
London Heathrow to Washington Dulles with British Airways. This was our return journey to the U.S. as we had flown over to London on a BA B747400 in First from DFW. We were warmly greeted upon boarding and escorted to our seats. The A380 interior in First cabin was immaculate with even more personal space at our seats when compared with the 747. Once again the on board service was excellent as was the food and wine although once again the steak was a bit overcooked. I truly hope we will be able to fly in First again one fine day with BA.
10 hours flight AC so high it feels freezing and they dont give you small blanket. Just small pillow. Monitors without headphones. Coffee without sugar. Delayed 5 hours because there was no staff to clean the plane. And now waiting for a gate for 20 minutes after landing. Just stay away.
Worst company I have flown with. Just avoid it at any cost. Its a lot better to pay more for another company. Once they cancelled a flight a week before our journey to Santorini Greece September 2021 and they didnt refund anything. Just like that and the mails said that we will give you refund etc and nothing ever happened. But we said okay it was just bad luck or a coincidence. And also there were no other flights the days we wanted so it was a dead end. Now we have booked priority in order to have our carry on with us. We saw the tickets and they told us we cannot have our carry on with us. We show them that it says here we are allowed to have 10kg bag per person and everything that is written in the ticket and they just answered us that these are general information but they say for my journey the times the airplane door etc everything. We show them the confirmation mail that says we have priority etc and they told us in our system it doesnt say so. And we just paid again for what we had already paid.
Kulula flights are always delayed. My flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town as well as this flight back to Johannesburg are both delayed due to technical issues. I am beginning to wonder if Kulula are just so illprepared that all the lastminute checks find issues.
We were very excited about our Club World journey to Mauritius and how disappointed we were. The food wasnt great the wines werent either and the foot part of my flat bed kept on collapsing so I hardly got any sleep. The cabin staff were good and very helpful. We have travelled Virgin Upper Class and it is much better as your bed is made up with a duvet and sheets. All we got on British Airways was a sort of rather nasty blanket and no sleep suit either. Very disappointed in all of it. Our flight was terribly delayed because the incoming flight to Gatwick was struck by lightening which is not BAs fault I know but I would have thought they could provide another plane to save having to wait so long as they have done in the past. Maybe they just dont have spare planes any more long haul. We have travelled British Airways Europe several times in the past 3 years and think this is wonderful but long haul just does not do it for us and certainly we hope next time we go long haul we wont have to travel British Airways unless they pull up their socks.
Very nice trip with Qatar Airways from Venice to Bangkok via Doha. Excellent food service and crew. Both flights leaving on time and arriving early. Marco Polo Lounge in Venice with a nice design and typically Italian but basic food options. A330200 with the older type of seats which are in my opinion although many writers here disagree very comfortable and no problem to find several hours of sleep. It has not to be totally flat A380 seat comfort a little better more personal space and also good sleeping fully flat sleeping position. The only thing I would advise Qatar Airways to review and find a better supplier is the coffee awful on both legs.
Today as I boarded the flight i am greeted by two gentlemen wearing on their shirt a badge with safetysecurity written on. One of them had the mask only on the chin uncovering the nose. This shows lack of professionalism. These days more than ever every detail is capital.
I have purchased round trip for almost 4000 not mentioning additional charge 30 for WiFi Not mentioning that business class is looking more like premium economy the stewardesses do not want to do their job. They make you sit till food service is almost ending. Food is horrible they running out of every selection. Serving cheap wine and only 2 glasses seats are not comfortable. I will not use this airlines again Max price it should cost is 1700 at most Staff need to get a better training how to treat business class passengers Goodbye Tap Portugal
EDILHRFCOLHREDI. EDI lounge good. Flight to LHR on time food decent attentive crew. North lounge at T5 much better than chaotic South lounge. Flight to FCO by 3 cabin 767 so upgraded using avios fully flat beds great FAs superb food good wine. Lounge at FCO okay food not great. Flight delayed at FCO due to storms at LHR so ample time to use the flat beds watch a film and relax. FA excellent food very good again. Overall the flights and service were superb.
Surat Thani to Bangkok. Overall a good experience if you know how to stick to the rules. Print your boarding pass no mobile boarding pass pay beforehand for your check in luggage 20K max and respect the size and weight of carry on luggage. If you stick to these rules things will be fine smooth check in boarding. flight departed and arrived on time. the crew was OK. Not overly friendly but who cares its a low cost carrier
I have taken Kenya Airways a number of times and it is quite disappointing that instead of improving the service continues to get worse. The food served remains almost inedible and inflight entertainment is virtually nonexistent. Due to COVID they cancelled my tickets. Unfortunately proved to be a horrendous experience as customer service is virtually nonexistent. The airline doesnt respond to emails and the telephones indicated on their website does not get picked It did not help that one is left with no option since they closed their offices. This airline needs to be more responsive to its customers it seems to want to be known literally to go with the notion of polepole or slowly if it is to get itself out of its reported financial woes due to plunging customer numbers.
I traveled from Kuala Lumpur to the Gold Coast on a rather full Air Asia X flight. I was able to sleep a little bit on the flight. I will fly them again.
Flight VA609 Friday 25. November 2022 1115 When Boarding at the gate I have been told that I will not fly today I have been offloaded because they are overbooked due to another cancelation. No alternative has been offered I had to find out on my own. To mention I am flying frequently and spend quite a lot of money with Virgin. I claimed to be put back on this plane thanks to the lovely ladies from ground staff in the lounge that is where I am now but not sure where my luggage is or will be. Plane is already 35 min late due to unloading and reloading of luggage.
Flight I had with Singapore Airlines are late by up to 90 mins on arrival. Its inferior to Qatar Airways business class underwhelming lounges okay onboard catering no diningondemand quirky flatbed seats on the A350ULR and more so on the new A380 meager amenities onboard. The cabin crew is somewhat the only part of Singapore Airlines nearly on par with Qatar Airways.
Flew Turkish Airlines from Belgrade to Munich via Istanbul. Excellent airline great food. The best European business class product definitely. Hard and soft product. On time. Best seats best food the best lounge transfer. I love flying with them because they recognize their loyal customers very well.
I have flown with Turkish Airlines over a 100 times in business and in economy and they have never disappointed me. Always great staff great food good inflight entertainment free headphones and blankets new planes except TK35. I highly recommend this airline.
Vancouver to Zurich. I was a little sceptical about travelling on a Leisure airline longhaul even in Business class part of a roundworld fare. Edelweiss Air proved me wrong. Great cabin crew a great aircraft with full flat beds. Great food. Trouble free journey.
Lisbon to Washington via Paris. Absolutely terrible service. Was stuck in Paris and was repeatedly lied to. We were told that we were going to be bussed to an airport hotel because of the storm. They sent us to a hotel at Disney more than 45 kilometers from the airport. They provided no transportation back to the airport which ended up being very expensive. My baggage was lost. Customer service was terrible throughout. Not an ounce of compassion or even a hint of an apology. Just poor and arrogant customer service.
LATAM changed our flights soon after booking changing our 2 hour layover in Lima Airport to a 24 hour layover also making us miss our first night or our booking in our resort. We attempted to resolve the issue with our booking agent and with LATAM staff at the airport in their call centre but they were unwilling to help us or reimburse us for anything at all. Since when is it acceptable to leave 2 senior citizens in an airport for 24 hours during a covid pandemic without offering any help. To top it off staff at the airport were rude I could resumed their message to its not our fault. I would like to know whos fault they think it is. I filed a complaint with LATAM but their response can be resumed I am very sorry you had a bad experience there will be no reimbursement. Fly with this airline at your own risk and allow plenty of time for itinerary changes as they appear to be very unreliable and unwilling to help.
The check in counter staff were rude and slow and whenever you ask them to hurry up because youre late to your flight they say you shouldve come earlier. Jeddah to Sharjah they forced me to pay for extra luggage for the handbag i came with from Sharjah to Jeddah. I came with this bag same bag same weight why you force me pay for it Either you pay or you split the weight into two bags.
Bangkok to Mae Sot District with Nok Air. Dont fly with this airline if there are others choices The legroom on Q400 is horrible The cabin quite smelly The service was fine. Way too far from low cost premium airline as they called themselves.
CopenhagenParis 30 Dec. 2023 on new A220300. Checkedin in airport took only a few minutes and the officer was kind accommodating and professional. I was allowed luggage checkin beyond Paris the whole way to Africa despite on a different ticket and on an airline without any alliance. That saved me a lot of time and hassle in transit in Paris going to a distant terminal. As a Flying Blue status holder I was respected and could choose seat freely. Thus I pampered myself with an entire exit row. The two lounges AF uses in CPH are both quite fine the Apartment is a quiet restaurant with nice buffet while the Carlsberg is merely a noisier bar with snacks and cold foods. One can choose among freely them and even walk forth and back if so wanted. Gate boarding on time. Onboard drinks and wines were flowing freely and staff were good. Cold sandwiches served. On time. Luggage delivered to final destination. Highly recommended.
As soon as I boarded the plane it was hot. Air conditioner was not on. It got hotter and hotter and hotter inside the plane while all others after me boarded. That process took roughly about 40 minutes for everybody to board. Despite many people trying to cool themselves by fanning newspapers or whatever that were in their hands and requests to the crew to switch on the air conditioner it was still not switched on. When finally the plane started moving I thought the ac would now be switched on bot no they still would not switch it on. The plane spent 20 minutes taxiing on the tarmac before taking off. The air conditioners finally came on about 7 minutes into the flight for a flight that only lasts 30 minutes. The same thing happened on the return with no air conditioner on until well into the flight. This is utterly disgusting on the part of Regent Airways. I have flown on this airline before as well and the same thing happened on those occasions as well. If Regent Airways are reading this please increase your fares to cover the cost of fuel for keeping the ac on right from the time of boarding to keep passengers comfortable. This is obviously a cost cutting exercise in fuel costs but this is really disgusting. I am pretty sure all those waving their newspapers and anything else to keep themselves cool would much prefer to pay a few more Taka extra for the ac to be kept on than the terrible experience they get whilst on board your flights.
Rusty old broken aircraft. Ground staff at Vancouver airport misguided me for not upgrading my flight to business so unable to upgrade my tickets and suffered a flight in economy class. Booked seats by paying extra money and seats were the worst. Broken arms broken entertainment system. Nothing was working at all. For 15 hrs of the flight we just sitting looking at blanks screen. Very very poor aircraft rusty or cushions broken seats useless entertainment systems.Even though business and economy seats were vacant the crew were not able to provide us alternatives which is a shame. I will never ever travel again on Air India flights and would never recommend anyone using it.
Istanbul to Lagos. During the boarding flight attendant has changed our window seats by exit in a row of two to non exit seats in the middle of the row of four. We did not check the seat but asked her if the change is to equivalent seats and got a yes to only see later that she misinformed us. The food selection was not available. Good enterntsinmrnt system but some times has problems and too much announcements. Out of 4 flights one suitcase damaged a lot one delayed by two days. Staff in the plane friendly and helpful
Istanbul to Singapore. Great service very helpful and friendly cabin crew. Flight was on time. I love Turkish food and food selection and taste the best.
Singapore to Copenhagen. I usually fly this route with Singapore Airlines and have found my satisfaction declining with their offer lately. There was over a one and a half hour delay to our departure with no apology from the captain or crew when we landed in Copenhagen. There was quite some turbulence on this flight and the plane appeared to be struck by lightning at one point which was also not commented on by the captain despite many passengers being visibly shaken by the experience. The Boeing 777200 had an old interior with the entertainment system not working on my seat nor those of my two companions. The interiors of these planes are simply not up to standard for a 5star airline and are well overdue for their scheduled upgrade. The crew were courteous and attentive and regularly came through the cabin with refreshments.
Currently sitting on runway for 1 hour. When we landed captain said it would be 5 min. How can you make people pay 1000s of dollars and be so understaffed and unprepared. Its criminal. We are crammed in on this plane like sardines. Worst flight ever. Shameful service Air Canada
Would avoid using this airline again. Bristol to Dalaman flight OK plenty of leg room with no extra charge however Dalaman to Bristol was a nightmare flight was put forward to 3 oclock instead of 5clock and whilst checking in the board said Bristol and Newcastle so we had to ask what was going on. Without any notice we had to fly to Newcastle and then to Bristol which extended our flying time to 6 hours. I think this is appalling considering they didnt give us any free refreshments or an apology You get what you pay for.
I have never been able to travel with Air Europa. I had purchased the MilanPanama ticket in February 2020 the flight was scheduled for the dates 31 March12 April 2020. Due to Covid19 the flight was obviously cancelled. I was first informed that the ticket was nonrefundable but I could get the voucher valid for one year. As I could not use the voucher for the year as flights were continuously cancelled I was informed that I could get a refund for the ticket. I have not received a reply by email since April 2021 not even by certified mail. When I call I am told that I am still in a long queue to send an email to which I obviously do not receive a reply. Very bad customer service.
Eurowings lost my luggage on the 2 of July. Now it is almost week and i didnt get any news about my luggage. All my holidays I spent without my medicine clothes swimming suits and clothes for my child. Now I have to go to the next destination and there is no possibilities to get my luggage there. Communication with Eurowings is very poor. I found that a lot of people have the same problems with this Airline. I am really very unsatisfied with this experience and please be aware before your trip with Eurowings.
Istanbul to Izmir. Very good meal and staff. The plane took off on time. Staff was smiling sandwiches were delicious. Will fly again.
MRURUNSYDNOU return. High level of service across the board. No difference between flying on an ATR 72500 and a B777300. The crew were well groomed polite and efficient. Great Creole cuisine with a French savoir fare. Hot meals for the main services and good open sandwiches in between. On Demand Entertainment System worked well with plenty of choices. International magazines available. Clean lavatories.
We flew Peruvian Airlines round trip from Lima to Cuzco. Both flights were over an hour late. LAN Chile flights on same routes at same times ran on time. Aircraft was over 30 years old. Staff and crew were completely lackadaisical about delays. No explanations or apologies were given. Running 1 to 2 hours late seemed to be standard operating procedure. Policies were inconsistent. No carryons allows on one flight with unlimited carryons on the next in the same aircraft. There are several other carriers operating on this route. Take one of them.
Our flight was delayed from for 3 hours it then took off and diverted to a different airport 3 hours later. It stayed here for another two hours due to weather conditions which happens what was not acceptable however was not providing any food. By this point my children hadnt eaten since midday and it was now 9pm. It then finally arrived at Munich at 2230 and we disembarked at 2300. Told to head to the service desk to see what was next especially since a lot of people including us had missed their connection flight. The queue was huge and the very helpful help desk closed at 0000 before most people could get any information. A tannoy announcement came over saying they could not provide any hotels but people could either get a hotel and then claim it back or were welcome to stay at the airport on the floor and check on the flights at 0600 the next day. No substantial food was offered. A twix and juice carton was provided to substitute the missed meal. We opted to go for a hotel as we had young children. Unfortunately the taxi queue was also huge To make things worse it was outside in the snow and well into the minus numbers. What turned this experience from awlful to utterly ridiculous was that we had barely any warm clothes as our final destination was South Africa in the summer. We had to wait an hour before we could get a taxi. We were not allowed to collect our baggage which we may have been able to add a few more layers as it had been transferred to the flight tomorrow. Or so the tannoy said. We were unable to confirm this as previously mentioned the help desk closed. I checked on the app and it did appear that we were on the same flight the following day. I was unable to reserve seats to ensure we were sat together as the flight was less than 24 hours away but that was a task for tomorrow. That morning I discovered that I had in fact been kicked off that rebooking. According to the app I had now reached my final destination and so the seats were now vacant and booked by someone else. I attempted to use the app online portal the live chat and calling up the help line number none of these could help and told me I had to go the the service desk in the airport. I then spent from 0945 till 1205 in a queue to speak to one of the 5 people working in the service help centre I was number 3538 and when I got there it was at 3342 there were 12 desks for attendants to work from but Lufthansa decided that the queue trailing the length of the airport only justified half filling those positions. Finally I was told that it was a glitch in the system and that there was nothing they could do about it but would book me in for the following day. So me and my family had to spend another day in mid winter with no warm clothing. Luckily the there was no issues with the next flight except that our laggage was temporarily missplaced. We did manage to recover it and headed out for our holiday thinking that the worse was behind us. This was just the outward journey. The I was informed on 4pm the day before the flight home. It had been cancelled I spent 4 hours on hold to get in touch with the eversohelpful Lufthansa online chat number 372 in queue They informed me that the link flight from Frankfurt was cancelled due to bad weather condition and would not find a replacement flight.
This airline does not care about its customers. My family and I were supposed to take the flight from LAX to Barcelona in May of the Covid19 crisis of 2020. Even though our flight was cancelled by the airline we were not given a refund for our almost 2000 worth of tickets. We were only provided cash points even though a refund was requested to be used on a future flight. Let me tell you there are absolutely no flights scheduled from LAX to Barcelona for the foreseeable future. Do not book Norwegian Air
Heathrow to Tashkent via Istanbul. Travel chaos as Turkish Airlines customer service nosedives at Istanbul airport. There was certainly no Turkish Delight on Turkish Airlines yesterday when passengers originating from London on the TK 1986 were left stranded in Istanbul because Turkish Airlines decided to offload them because an overbooking problem on the onward flight. Its the first time ever in my 30 year career in the travel industry that Ive ever been exposed to such unprofesssional service. Most airlines protect international passengers on feeder flights. Even though the flight arrived late there was still a 30 minute transfer window and we all arrrived at the departure gate before boarding commenced only to be told that we were all offloaded. Disgrace unprofessional service resulting in a 3 hour wait to get accommodated at 3 am in the morning. Im amazed at how Turkish Airlines pretends to be a global player promoting Istanbul as a global travel hub when it cant even deal with the basics. A truly nighmare experience. Looking forward to seeing how they resolve my ongoing problems Travellers beware when booking international connections with Turkish Airlines the cheaper fares could truly deliver a cheap and nasty experience youll remember for a long time
First when trying to manage our booking it didnt accept our booking ref.no. but it accepted the eticket number. Our flight is from Phnom Penh to Colombo via Kuala Lumpur self checkin in KL. It only gave me itinerary for the flight from Phnom Penh to Kuala Lumpur and only for one traveler altough there are two of us. While trying to manage our booking the booking confirmation was sent to a weird and suspicious email and my contact number was removed and changed into a Chinese phone number. After I changed this strange email to my email address I received the booking confirmation in Chinese only. All this made us very suspicious and we tried to contact AirAsia office with a number from their website. However the phone operator informed me that this number doesnt exist. We are now not sure what to do.
Round trip PEKFNJ. New Tupolev plane. Service inflight entertainment and food excellent. A clean and comfortable plane comfortable seats and professional flight crew.
Left Cairo ok on arrival at Riyadh at approx 7pm once on wifi a reminder email arrived telling us of a new flight number and departure time now 11 hours away at 0600. No communication from ground staff about luggage delay any options to stay somewhere nothing. At 3am some passengers managed to raise the issue with airport manager who spoke to the Flynas manager . He then got off his backside issued boarding passes to the 20 odd people stranded and checked luggage is available to hopefully end up at our destination at the same time as us. Customer service at last. Such lack of service by a Saudi airline does not reflect well on the country.
Istanbul to Antalya. Checkin and boarding smooth. Plane was clean and seats were comfortable. Staff was polite enough. About 20 minutes after the take off they served a sandwich and a cup of drink that you chose from given options. Though I think food should sold with a separate option instead of being included to every ticket it was delicious so no complaints there. Overall everything was good. I had bad experiences with Turkish Airlines but this time I am satisfied.
Flew on Oct 21st from Ezeiza to Miami on AR 1304. Equipment was Airbus 330200. Traveled in Business Class Seat 5d Check in service was very friendly and efficient. Business class lounge was spacious and comfortable and serviced by attentive staff. Boarding was very good and through a separate jet way from other cabin. Welcome on board was very friendly and helpful. Seats are flat but at an angle very uncomfortable and I kept on sliding downwards. Inflight entertainment was good in terms of equipment but mediocre as far as programming both audio and video. Unfortunately the only WC in business class was out of order so we had to use filthy economy class lavatories. Not good.
Its the 3rd or 4th time they give us seats far away from each other with no option to selectcheck in before flight. The flight attendant told me its because it has to be paid before boarding. First of all no other company does this. If money is a problem for this poor company then simply raise the ticket price and dont separate families. It is the last time I fly with this joke of a company.
Flight from HKG to TPE December 19 2013. Flight delayed by almost 1 hour. Boarding procedure is very slow. Aircraft used was an old A330. Seats though wide and comfy for an economy is really old and needs upholstery. Food however is terrible and the worst Ive seen in a full service airline.
Bengaluru to Chennai. We were made to wait for half an hour in the baggage drop line. Line was short staff were inefficient. Our eboarding pass expired before our flight and we had to get a new one with different seats. We had to wait for the bus again for 10 minutes in the hot sun before we could board the flight. We took AirAsia from Chennai to Bangalore as well. Similar experience. Staff are inefficient ground crew and processes terrible. Not recommended at all.
Manado to Sorong. Flight left about 20 mins late. Seats were comfortable with entire empty rows at the back. A very basic breakfast of water and a spongy bread roll served.
First of all the front desk ladies were very sweet and helpful I can not complain about them. Now lets start the staff on board were rude and did not seem bothered with the clients at all. After the safety instructions were done they simply went and buckled themselves in not one of them came by and checked to see if any of the passengers were buckled in. When we arrived my sons car seat was booked in as special baggage well thank you for breaking the chair into two pieces. The car seat was thrown on the floor in the middle of the conveyors where you collect your bags. We asked the people at the kiosk where we should collect the special baggage they simply pointed to stuff thrown on the floor and there was where my sons car seat was thrown. When we flew with Mango on the 4th they brought my sons car seat to us to the kiosk on a trolley as it should be but to throw someones baggage like it garbage is disgusting. Staff have no personality no drive and no respect for your clients goods. When we flew with Mango again on the 4th of Feb the pilots were excellent they kept telling us and informing us where we were but the pilots of flysafair did none of that. I regret not flying with Mango again and regret that I used your services. I will never be you client again and I advise anyone not to make use of your services
Athens to Dubai. I enjoyed my flight. The flight was punctual and check in and boarding was easy. The staff were very helpful and friendly and coped well with a full flight with passengers of many backgrounds. I enjoyed the meal served as well as the food and drinks served. IFE was excellent.
I have flown with Qatar Airways many times the past year but this time it was my sons first flight abroad. The air hostesses really made sure that he being a toddler was catered for and always checked up on him. He enjoyed every meal and treat that was given and the variety of movies kept him busy. I feel that being a silver member that my wife and son should receive the same access given to me.
Sydney to Bali. I received an email a week before from Malindo airlines changing my return journey by 3 days. With no alternative but to rearrange my entire holiday. Their customer service was appalling as they had no idea as to what they could offer customers like me in distress. I will never fly with this airline ever again and I still dont know what Im going to do with my flights.
Excellent service and a great experience with Qatar Airways flying from Doha to Kochi. I cant but write about the crew and the service I received. Crew were genuinely caring. They proved to be a five star airline in all aspects food service entertainment.
I booked a round trip from Milan to California for my honeymoon. First flight Milan to San Francisco via London while returning flight was from Los Angeles to Milan always via London. Both flights faced 1 hour delay and in both flights our luggage were not delivered at destination. When you check in the bags business class is mixed with other One World members so it is not exclusive at all. Only First has some real advantages. We found business lane crowded for the category. Worst business class experience and totally disappointed.
My AirAsia Zest flight was a short flight from Manila to Cebu but a good trip. I arrived 20 minutes earlier than scheduled my seats were upgraded for free and my check in luggage arrived on time in the baggage claim. Everything was good but unfortunately during my flight they took off the headrest covers on the seats and the head rest looks unclean. For money I paid for and the service I got I was satisfied.
Toronto to Bucharest. Contacted Customer Care at Air Canada and have been provided with links to the policies of the company very much useless. Paid over 2 thousand dollars for my parents for an international flight paid about 300 dollars round trip for regular check in luggage below 23 kg. My parents got a piece of bread dipped in maple syrup no free coffee or tea on the flight to Bucharest last night. Will think twice before booking Air Canada. I will not make that mistake again.
We had an awful experience flying with Norse from London to Orlando on July 16 2023. We stayed in line for 2.5 hours to check in to get our boarding pass we had already checked in online and still had to wait in line for 2.5hrs. We had to run to go through security to make it on time with small children. We didnt have time to use the bathroom buy water or eat and we were traveling with children. It was not a pleasure at all flying with Norse. I do not recommend Norse to any of my friends the employees were rude and stressed out. Even the lady at the counter was rude that the passports were not on the right page. I had just ran to pass security with two children had to use the bathroom didnt eat or drink water and the Norse employee was rude and not understanding. We ordered tapas in the airplane and we received it 30 minutes before landing. My children were hungry the whole time and did not have time to eat as we landed and threw away since we couldnt got through customs with the food. I will be putting on my Facebook and Instagram with hundreds of followers my experience with Norse. My best wishes for the future of this business.
No entertainment. Always late and dont care about the passengers. Have not flown the for a while because of bad service experiences in the past. Then they changed their flight schedule and it suited better time wise so I tried them again. 4 flight and 2 were delayed. Will now miss connection due to them as as expected they wont care. Food is really bad and the planes are falling to pieces on the inside. The last 4 flight has had seats with hand written notes out of order and the neck rests are not there its open metal rails and they are at the emergency exits.
Stansted to Lanzarote return. Flight both ways departed on time and arrived early. For a 4 hour flight seat and seat pitch were both satisfactory. Staff both ways carried out their duties well. The only complaint is for a 4 hour flight I would expect in flight entertainment all we had was a flight map which was stopped on both flights far too early.
Rome to Paris. It was my first time flying with Air France and the first impression I got after being boarded was the yellowed up plastic around the old screen panel on the back of the seats. The inflight entertainment on the A380 was disastrous. To give the impression that they have more movies to offer a movie with 4 languages would be displayed as 4 movies touch screen was extremely nontouchsensitive screen pivot was broken. The saving grace was that I managed to get some sleep in the air. Air France booked a 75 min transfer for us and thanks to landing 20 minutes early we managed to board on time for our connecting to Rome. On our trip back at Rome ground staff assistance was nonexistent the precheckedin queue for bag drop was slower than the normal checkinbagdrop queue. A queue of 4 parties spent almost an hour moving down the line I was only moved to the front during last call for checkin...I arrived 2 hours before scheduled departure. Connection in Paris CDG was horrendous the moment we landed we had to rush out of the plane rush to a shuttle to take us to the transit area. It was the longest queue I have seen at an airport passport control. We snuck into a priority queue and went to the front. Alas after clearance we had to wait for a shuttle to get to another terminal. At this point we were almost sure we would miss the flight. Disembarking the shuttle bus we rushed to the terminal lobby and luckily managed to find our way to our boarding gate at last call. We were so glad Air France booked us on China Eastern.
I havent actually taken a flight with Air Europa because covid travel restrictions smashed my European travel plans. That being said Im sitting on two round trip business class tickets that I need to cancel or get some type of future credit but after trying 6 separate times to contact a customer service representative phone email you name it I am giving up. I have waited more than 3 hours on hold and have yet to have anyone answer. The support line says 24 hours but on off hours you will just get a recording due to circumstances beyond our control we cannot answer your call right now. Please try again in a few minutes.
Horrible. Client service is practically nonexistent. After one of my flights was cancelled they put me on another flight which left 30 hours earlier leaving me with 32 hours between my flights. Tried to contact Sri Lankan Airlines for 2 weeks but only Facebook Messenger replied and they couldnt help me. Contacted their phone number in Belgium and in The Netherlands but none of them could help me. Wasted 30 calling to Colombo to stand in the waiting line for over 10 minutes. Finally just 1.5 days before I was going to fly and after stalking them on Facebook Messenger they contacted me and rescheduled my second flight so I left one day earlier than planned. On board entertainment wasnt working at first then once it worked you couldnt watch a film because it froze all the time. Will never fly with them again.
I flew with them on the 24th March 2023. What a great service and the Airline rep Debbie was so helpful and friendly and she helped us to do a very smooth checkin. I have to say it was 5 star service all the way from London to Bangkok and back and I cannot wait to fly with them again. Thank you for such a great service and looking forward to fly with you again.
Pittsburgh to Austin. I booked a flight in March. I never received an email stating that my flight was cancelled or that the airline was bought out by another company Ashley Airlines. I simply went to check in 24 hours in advance and was unable to. When I contacted Pittsburgh Airport they informed me that Via Air had not been flying there since APRIL. So now I drive to the airport to try and find another flight and of course my 258 flight to Austin is now 1000 dollars for a similar trip. Needless to say I declined going to my friends bachelorette party and missed out on all of the weekend fun. If you want to make it to your destination do not book with this airline. They literally have an F rating on Google and Yelp. So splurge an extra 100 for a reliable airline.
Melbourne to Athens via Doha. The cabin crew created a restful and friendly atmosphere. A number of children who were restless and tired while boarding quickly settled down when they received their activity packs. I found that the time of the first long leg passed quickly thanks to ambient lighting attentive service and an entertainment system which worked without any problems. From Doha to Athens the flight attendant allocated to our seat was particularly helpful responding courteously to special requests about meals and drinks. On both legs the plane was full but remained clean and orderly throughout. Passengers seemed aware of the need to make some variations to the flight path. As I had a window seat I got to see a most impressive snow capped mountain peak below. The minimal amount of time added was amply compensated for by the efficient way the flight crew managed boarding disembarkation take off and landing.
LGWFaro return 19th26th Aug Economy 2 adults 2 children. Whole experience from Check In to arrival in Faro outstanding. As a regular traveller on this route have now got used to the ex BMI airbuses on this route the seating is perfectly comfortable despite the reduced seat pitch and have never had any problems when requesting more than one drink during the flight. The crew were fantastic in both directions and were totally service orientated from start to finish. Only one minor issue and that is the only one toilet at the rear for the whole economy cabin
I was not expecting anything good from TK but I was totally satisfied with their service. Great IFE system and seats. Friendly cabin crew and professional staff. Will fly again with them for sure.
San Francisco to Paris Orly. This was my first experience flying a low cost carrier internationally and I wish I had been better prepared. The flight to Orly was fine except the seats were extremely uncomfortable they are molded resin and my body did not match the mold they used The food was almost inedible and you have to pay for wine The return trip was a nightmare somehow they had reversed the names of my granddaughter and the check in person refused to issue a boarding pass From then on the nightmare got worse as I was referred from counter to counter after two hours of this they finally issued a boarding pass with the original name reversalThe Orly French Bee staff were poorly trained or nor trained at all and the counters were dramatically understaffed. If you are going to fly French Bee take your own foodmake sure you have pillows etc. as these are not provided and accept there are no freebies at all
Flew Delhi Paro return with outbound travel 27 Oct return 3 Nov. J class both ways. What a wonderful airline Hot towels before takeoff. Excellent meal enroute with a choice of 3 hot entrees. Bar service. Hot towels again before landing. Seats were standard F class. No entertainment. Flight attendants were friendly and accommodating. Flew right by Mt. Everest both directions which the captain pointed out. Landing in Paro quite interesting as was takeoff.
Gatwick to Malaga. When booking the tickets I realised that by choosing certain flights in Club the fare was cheaper than economy once I had added suitcases and pay for food onboard I hadn t flown BA Club in Europe for a while and was looking forward to it. I was nicely impressed. My outbound flight was a wetlease by Titan but this was the full BA service. The crew were very good as they were friendly and polite without being sugary sweet. I was very impressed by the quality and quantity of the food together with the selection of drinks. The only fault is that on both legs my suitcase did not come out as priority despite being tagged correctly.
Possibly the worst airline you can board. The staff is terrible and seems unpaid as rude behaviour reflects upfront. They will cool down the cabin temperature to below 18 degrees and then start renting out thin blankets for 400500 rs. They change the gate frequently and wont send you any message. When you confront them they will simply shrug their shoulders. No words to define how low they can go to harass customers. Experience it on your own to know more. Do not opt for this airline. It may save you couple hundred bucks but will give you nightmares of life time.
Fort Lauderdale to Nassau Bahamas. The flight was smooth and the flight attendants were helpful and professional. The landing was smooth and nicely done.
Chiang Mai to Koh Samui in Economy Class. Check in was quite quick at Chiang Mai and we used the Bangkok Airways lounge which although basic is free for all passengers. Flight boarded on time and Bangkok Airways managed the boarding process quite efficiently and did not allow passengers to jump their allotted boarding group. The A319 was in good condition and was probably one of their newer planes. A hot meal service was provided on this flight and included seafood with noodles and whilst the noodles were a bit soggy the meal was very tasty. Cabin crew were very pleasant. Flight landed on time and not too long wait for baggage. Overall a very good flight.
Flight cancelled due to ice storm in Portland. Chatted with multiple agents to help me get things figured out and was issued a refund. Wanted to shout out Jackie from Phoenix for being a literal angel and being so helpful.
Had a short flight from Denpasar to Surabaya the aircraft is good also with the service. One thing made me a bit disappointed is there was someone sat in my seat even though Ive did website checkin.
Bangkok to New York via Dubai. Very unfortunate experience on my latest Emirates flight. Im a Skywards member that flew in late February 2017 and had a poor experience. Later I made a complaint via email including the details. They took more than 5 weeks to reply and then just told me it never happened. From what I understand this is par for the course with their customer service. Im horrified by the customer service for this toprated airline. I wont be flying them again.
Bucharest to Miami vis Sibiu Munich. My worst experience with an airline so far. 3 weeks before departure they changed dates and hours technically I could choose to get my money back but buying from another company with such short notice would have been much more expensive what I paid for was Bucharest to Miami with one stop what I got was the same with 3 stops what I paid for was Miami to Bucharest with one stop what I got was the same with 2 stops. I had to book a hotel room for one night in Berlin because the flights were not in the same day after the change they made still waiting for a refund and they failed to deliver the luggage in Miami. It arrived after 2 days out of 4 Air Berlin flights 3 were delayed by approx 1 hour each. AirBerlin callcenter is bad. They say on the website is 24h but thats not true. If you call them when they dont work they dont say come back at operating hours. They just let you listen to bad music indefinitely on your own expense. and when they do answer they even give incorrect answers like saying Bucharest to Munich is a direct flight which was certainly not.
The worst I have ever tried. The food was very cold airplane was not clean they lost my luggage when they found it they did not offer any delivery instead asking me to come back to the airport in Amman while I live in Palestine. You will not be able to talk to any human being their chat system is useless they do not answer any call.
Bangkok to Fuzhou return. I had no idea what to expect on Xiamen Airlines. During checkin at Bangkok The counter was empty. The lounge in Bangkok was Air France and more than satisfactory. The boarding was orderly and not too chaotic. The purser at the door was smiling but when I said hello no response whatsoever. ot even eye contact. Boarding drinks served promptly. You cant use mobile phones Chinese law which is silly. There was no inflight entertainment so I just played my iPad. The flight attendant was polite made eye contact and was smiling. Her attempts at speaking english were OK she was just following the script. The previous reviews that mentioned The meals were the same both ways meant that both flights had the same choices. It was just a difference in entree fish or beef. The side dishes were exactly the same. Their way of costcutting I presume. After meal service the flight attendant left a bowl of mixed nuts and my drink. The return flight was the exact opposite. Bangkok to Fuzhou sector had 30 occupancy while the return sector had 100 occupancy. The lounge at Fuzhou airport was surprising for Chinese standards but no alcohol Boarding was orderly but after takeoff a firsttime flyer from the economy cabin trespassed into the business cabin and asked me Is this seat available and I said no. The same unruly passenger proceeded to annoy the business class flight attendants but they dealt with him professionally. The seat was uncomfortable both ways. The Boeing 737700 had very restrictive seating but ample space. The Boeing 737800 had comfortable seating but I had to bend my head during takeoff and landing since there was this bulging solid piece of rubber in the headrest. The cabin smelt of cigarettes or someone was smoking before the flight.
Very nice experience flight on time Boarding was very fast we arrived 10 minutes before the expected time. I would like to fly with Volotea more Times.
Ouagadougou to Gatwick the plane which was due to leave Ouaga at 1.00 am arrived at 4am departed at 5am. I asked one of the ground staff before departure if I could possible catch the connecting flight at Tripoli which was due to leave at 8.30 am considering that it was a 4 hours flight to Tripoli and 2 hours time difference in advance. I was reassured more than once that I will catch the plane and even a message had been sent to wait for me there. I boarded the plane with a lot of apprehension and when we arrived at Tripoli I was not surprised to find that the plane had left without me 2 hrs earlier. I contacted Afriqiyah staff and they looked embarased and didnt know what to do with me I had to stay in the airport lounge till the next day when one of the staff took somehow pity on me upgraded my ticket to the first class. Food is not bad inflight service good and 48 kg baggage allowance for somehow modest ticket price.
Brussels to Milan Malpensa. With only 29 euros including drink and snack this flight was a real bargain. CityJet flies this route on behalf of Brussels Airlines with a rare plane in the west the Russian built Sukhoi Superjet 100. This turned out to be a rather silent 23 seating plane with a good legroom. The nice crew the punctual departure and a truly beautiful view of the Swiss alps made this flight a very nice one.
Perth to Singapore. This is an older airbus and seats are ok with decent leg space. Very happy with the shopping selection for Jun to Aug the Sulwhasoo selection onboard has expanded again Food is decent and is served with real cutlery as opposed to cheap plastic cutlery and cardboard containers on other economy class flights. Service is great. For a 5 hour flight Singapore Airlines economy class is good value.
Very disappointed7 with icelandairs baggage handling and resolution. The initial flight was ok but I paid 76 for an extra bag upon returning to the USA. The bag didnt even get loaded on the aircraft. up in finding this out in Seattle I was promised that the bag would be with me the next day via courier since I live 2 hrs from the airport. It was not delivered and it is now day 3 and the bag has only just arrived in Seattle and is sat there I have a tracker in it and they consider the case closed. Very very poor follow up and I will be pursuing this to the fullest extent the regulations allow if they expect me to come and get the bag from them.
DMELEDDME DMEUUDDME. The company has the newest fleet in Russia. The crew are helpful. S7 also has the best website of all air companies in Russia. Buying tickets through the web online checkin are great. Selfregistration kiosks in the airports easy to use. Food on board is good. S7s hub is Domodedovo which is another advantage.
In January 2020 I bought two round trip tickets from Istanbul to Manila for December 2020. They cancelled the flights and promised me a full refund. They postponed the refund process wasted my time and energy by employing different timeconsuming tactics. Finally they promised me a refund exactly one year after the issue of the ticket which was due last January the 21st. It did not happen. What they did was to ask for additional documents. I am disappointed by the way they treated me during this process.
Flight out was on time return slightly delayed due to aborted landing on a windy day in Funchal. At least Monarch got the plane on the ground on the same day EasyJet and SAS failed and returned to their home bases. Cabin crew out and in bound very good. Seats were fine for 3.5 hour flight might be slightly less so on a longer flight as Monarch have ceased long haul not a problem. However we did pay for extra legroom. Good flight deck info both ways. One slight niggle ordered meal online both ways very tasty for an aircraft meal. Sitting in Row 10 finished the meal before the drinks trolley arrived. Maybe you could order drinks online too and get served at same time. As an airline would rate them higher than other UK located budget airlines.
Genuinely couldnt be more disappointed. This flight was almost the equivalent of Murphys Law in travel forms. What was supposed to be a 1 hour flight took twice as long because we were on the tarmac so long. Also paying for carryons is insane.
Cairo to Dubai. Very disorganized and misleading information about check in desks. The staff I dealt with have poor English language skills. The good side is a new aircraft.
Sydney to Delhi via Singapore. Amazing airline. Excellent customer service. Good food. But cannot understand how this one of the best airline in the world has ignored the plight of thousands of travellers who order special meal for so long. The problem is neither with the food nor the service standard of the crew. It is to do with the processes of serving the special meals. Special meals are first served. But no drinks are offered or served on demand. Either one should wait until the remaining passengers are served food with drinks and get a drink and let the nice food sit on the tray and let it get cold. Or eat the food without any drinks not even water. Singapore Airline should change its processes so thst the crew should bring the same trolley containing the selection of drinks while serving the special meal and offer the same selection of drinks to passengers being served special meal.
Sydney to Prague via Dubai early August. On arrival Dubai my companion and I were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to First Class due to overbooking in Business for the final leg to Prague. We were very well looked after in both classes. Uneventful trip home 3 weeks later from Hamburg to Sydney in Business.
RomeTimisoaraChisinau. At checkin desk in Rome we were informed that the flight Timisoara Chisinau was overbooked. 10 persons were left in Rome without any assistance from Carpatair. After a call to Timisoara they assured that we would fly for Budapest and later to Chisinau in 5 hours. After arriving to another terminal for checkin for Budapest at appointed time Alitalia representatives informed that Carpatair does not have a commercial agreement with them thats why we should call the Carpatair again. Finally they arranged another flight for another day. In short 20 hours of delay without any support. Lack of professionalism and care for clients.
Hong Kong to Taipei. It was a evening flight and they operated this very short haul route with a wide body aircraft with personal TV. Only snacks were provided with no main course which was quite disappointing. Cabin crew was efficient and they managed to offered me customised drink in a short time. Flight was a bit delayed due to traffic. The overall experience was fine except the food.
Although my original flight from New York to Palermo was on time I was not impressed with the staff nor the plane itself. The staff were rude and not friendly at all instead it seemed we were more of a nuisance rather than paying customers. On our flight home we were delayed over 3 hours and we were never informed prior to arrival at the airport. This delay led us to miss our connecting flight to New York. Although issues may arise with the planes the way they handled the situation was unprofessional. Once we arrived in Milan they gave us little direction on where we needed to go in the airport and we wasted an hour trying to figure out what we needed to do next. The airline put us up in a hotel and said we would leave the next day at the same time. At the hotel they provided us dinner which included dry pasta processed chicken mush for green beans and potatoes. When we asked for more sauce for the dry pasta they refused to give it to us unless we paid for it.
I had the misfortune of flying on this airline on 31st Aug from Durban to Joburg where I was catching an International flight. As usual Kulula were running late half an hour in this case with no explanations and no apologies. I had half an hour when we landed to get my case and run to the international side to book in Now I have to fly back with them on my return ticket on Monday. I have flown with them before and 9 out of 10 times they are late. Never again will I fly with them
This is a no frills airline. The seat had hardly any cushion and my body could feel the seat metal frame on a 4 hours flight.
Air Mauritius is appaling whilst on holidays I am Mauritian born the airline and its associated problems were in the papers on a daily basis. I got home with marks on my knees even though I have a baby which kept me in and out of my seat entertainment system did not work on 2 of our 4 seats delayed for 3hrs in terminal due to technical difficulty. Ground and inflight staff were extremely unhelpful trying to carry sleeping baby and two toddlers no one offered help passengers were offering help. Aircraft is cold with atrocious service we had food on the trays for ages whilst trying to move around in a limited legroom. Flight staff barely cared and when asked to assist appeared to be indignant. I am extremely disappointed of with Air Mauritius it does leave a good taste for tourists.
Travelled LGWMCOLGW route in Business and was really happy. Great check at Check in at LGW then priority security access. The lounge was superb. Seats on 777ER outward were 2J and 2K which were fine but we changed to 11E and 11F for the return as we noticed that on outward these were more enclosed. Flat beds were great Service was exceptional. Both flights left on time and arrived on time. Delta lounge at MCO is a bit dated but served a purpose so cant complain. Was a bit worried about the service reading some of the reviews but was pleasantly surprised. Well done BA.
Flew from Seoul to Shanghai Hongqiao. The plane both ways was a rather old slightly dilapidated Boeing 757. No entertainment was available but the service was friendly and efficient. The food on the outbound flight was much better than the flight back where we were just given a dry sandwich.
Use Avianca fly from Quito to Buenos Aires and then return. The quality of seats are extremely poor for a 56 hours flights in both flights our seats could not push back for sleeping and they said it is because it is in front of emergency exit row not sure why but at least this should be mentioned when they are selling the seat we paid for a seat which could not be pushed back down. The flight was 56 hours and they didnt offer anything to drinkeat instead they were selling low quality fooddrinks in the plane. That was a shame for a 900 and 6 hours long ticket they dont offer absolutely nothing to eatdrink. This is a terrible airline while few years before I had good experience travelling with Avianca. Will not use this airline anymore.
I recently had the pleasure of flying with Qatar airways and was fortunate to have Claire as my cabin crew member. From the moment I boarded the plane her warm and welcoming demeanor put me at ease. Throughout the flight she was attentive to my needs and went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable. Her professionalism and dedication to her job were truly impressive. Overall her exceptional service helped make my flight a pleasant and enjoyable experience.
Three trips between CCS and BLA. I found Conviasa to be clean modern friendly and welcoming. My Spanish is functional but quite basic and when I struggled there was usually multilingual staff even on the short hop from Caracas to Barcelona and back. Luggage allowance on this flight is a generous 30kg and a free drink is provided despite the flight time being only 3040 minutes. Seats comfortable with more room than I was expecting. All in all Conviasa offer a superior albeit slightly more expensive service on this short route than do their competitors Avior.
Checkin Desk rude and dismissive. Flight late but seems the new norm. One world emerald club world checkin. Staff uncommunicative did not know what baggage allowance entitled to once raised politely became argumentative and accusatory.
Athens to Budapest via Istanbul. There was a delay of 1 hour from Athens airport for the departure of the flight to Istanbul. As a result we reached the airport 20 min before the connection flight takes off for Budapest. There was no announcement about the connection flight nor arrangement for transferring us to the gateairplane. We reached the gate 10 min before the flight but the gate was closed. We were informed by the employee there to get to another gate which was wrong walking again for a long distance and then finally got at the transfer desk where after a long waiting que we were informed for our overnight stay in a hotel in Istanbul so as to get the flight of 7.00 am to Budapest. We were informed that our luggage had been out of the plane. Then we had to leave the hotel 3 hours before which means at 4.00 am.
Received a text saying that my 2000 flight from HANSGN would be delayed until 2310. This is common on Jetstar my house mate had his flight to Hue delayed by one day. If there are not enough customers booked the flight simply does not take off and if you do not send them your mobile phone number you wouldnt know until you turned up at the airport. If you want reliable service do not use Jetstar.
Hong Kong to Milan. A mediocre economy flight. The seat was pretty comfortable as CX standard even if my charging port was not working and the entertainment selection good. On the other hand the meal was the worst part of the flight. The menus were distributed but only one to be shared each 3 passengers saving on paper. Food was boring looking and not in a great quantity. Bread not very well heated. What is worst is that they serve filtered water from jars. Breakfast of congee or eggs with sausage. I believe that CX catering is most boring and predictable. Service was efficient but very cold. Next time I would consider flying with EK or QR. Despite the flights are not direct they are more enjoyable and much cheaper. 4 Hours more travelling are worth if you enjoy the experience more.
Arrive to New Orleans on time. I arrive there expecting a 3 hr layover. Instead it was due to delayed til 1045pm. That would have been over 7hrs. No reason why there was no one at checkin desk I was stuck at terminal with other passenger who had no clue. I called no answer sometime the flight just disappeared. I didnt not choose fly with Silver Airways. It was quick connecting flight. Why dont anyone notified why the flight is delayed is beyond me. No excuses just tell the passenger whats going on so we can make plans accordingly finally I was able to reach the airport operator about my situations and many others who was stuck on this flight. About 30 min before boarding finally some one showed up. Worse flight experience I ever encountered
Thai Smile is the worst airline in terms of customer service. I landed in Phenom Penh for vacation and after waiting for 30min I had to go to lost and found desk just to know my luggage along with other passengers who flew from Bangkok is missing. Their was no one from airline to help or compensate customers. Reaching their customer care is a next level challenge all together. The airport authorities sitting at lost and found counter will never respond or reach out to confirm the status. God bless people who travel via Thai Smile airline who makes sure their customers never leave smiling.
Edinburgh to St. Louis via Keflavik. Awful in every respect. Staff were rude. Seat pitch is totally unacceptable for transatlantic. Dont take cash on board then give awful exchange rate. Flight late with no explanation. No facilities on board. Cheep and cheerful I hear but this is cheap and terrible. Avoid at all costs.
Flew Emirates from Dubai to Manchester. Unfortunately I became unwell approximately 1.5hrs into the flight reason unknown. However can say the flight crew that looked after me in 68G went above and beyond with care three ladies especially. They moved me to where I could lay down. Im grateful for that their care and kindness helped me to endure what was an awful experience.
Quite good airline. However they sometimes missschedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Checkin times are fast and easy you can checkin very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive
First leg CAILHR was on time flight crew was pleasant but the seating was very cramped and legroom almost nonexistent. The second leg LHRJFK wasnt much different with helpful crew but horrible seating space. My knees were pressed against the seat in front of me constantly and had to relieve them one at a time. It used to be a flagship carrier but now its not much better than a budget airline. Will do my best to avoid.
I used to like Turkish Airlines a few years ago. Their service and catering quality has gone down and down. The cabin crew are pretty rude and dont care about passengers requests.
An excellent flight with Singapore Airlines from Wellington to Canberra. The flight attendants were exceptionally friendly professional and attentive. The food was also very good. The seat was perfectly adequate for the three hour flight and looked ok for an overnight service. If I did have one complaint it would be that the cabin was uncomfortably warm. The flight left on time arrived early and I was out the front door of Canberra airport ten minutes after touch down a great new option between the capital cities that I look forward to using on a regular basis.
At a time when airlines are getting lots of bad press what a nice surprise it was flying with Air Transat. Both our flights to Punta Cana and home were flawless. We will definitely use Transat again.
While I generally have had a positive experience of JetBlue in past I was shocked by JetBlues late cancellation of its flight from Aguadilla to NYC. More than the cancellation the agents at the airport told me that my hotel would be compensated for up to 250 given there were no more flights for the day. When I got home the customer service agents said that this was not what they said and that they likely meant your hotel might be reimbursed up to that amount. It was really surprising and also given the hassle and additional expenses we had to incur to get a hotel and to another airport the next day it was really frustrating.
This is by far the worst and nonreliable airline Ive ever used. They departed 3 hours before the departing time shown on the ticket without notice. When I asked for the refund they are keep saying we will pass this email to specialist but didnt hear from specialist for almost one months. Of course they did not refund the ticket. Do not use this airline if you want to ruin your holiday. Also whatever they say you wont get the money back since they will never reply your email.
I came to the airport 2 hours in advance but I still lost my flight. The staff of SMK airport was rude and unhelpful and told me that according to Wizz Air rules they charge 60 euros for checkin in the airport. No refund no money no trip.
My flight with Norwegian was booked for 22 May but I had to cancel it due to Covid19. Originally they told me I would be given Cash Points for use against a future flight. After months of pursuing them for my Cash Points their online claim system did not work I finally received an email saying that Cash Points were not being given on internal flights so no refund would be made apart from taxes. I had other internal flights in Norway booked with SAS. I also had to cancel these. Full credit voucher given within 24 hours for use in next two year. Norwegian take some lessons in customer care.
From Athens to Santorini. The flying time was so short around 35 mins. But served cookies and hot drinks. The flight departed from Athens on time. Flight announcement was clear and correct.
Flew from Madrid to Brussels and the service on board was professional courteous and pleasant. The flight was packed but seating was comfortable for a 2 hour flight. Drinks and snacks are for purchase in Economy. Prompt baggage delivery in Brussels was really appreciated. Only downside was the very lengthy check in process in Madrid airport. Only 2 desks for 150 customers. The staff there worked non stop but they were simply not enough to process the customers faster.
I flew with Ural Airlines not very long time ago and for a regional airline they are not bad at all. The aircraft seemed to be a secondhand one watching at the seats of different textile but it was clean and without any tapes around the windows. The food was good enough the only thing angried me that there were no fizzy drinks available compared to the last years flight but crisis what can we do. The cabin crew seemed tired but I could see passion in helping people I saw how the cabin crew attendant helped one person to eat whos hands did not work properly. This is actually the best thing I can mention in the cabin crew. The flight was straight away on time. Of course it is slightly worse than Aeroflot or S7 Airlines.
RTMLCY. The lunchtime flight departed Rotterdam precisely on time. The aircraft has 2x2 seating with sufficient underseat space for hand luggage and a table big enough to work on with a laptop. Although small the Embraer 170 aircraft newly deployed on this route feels agile spacious and comfortable. Despite rough weather on the approach into LCY the flight arrived ahead of schedule. Service on board was highly professional with all passengers receiving complimentary drinks and snacks. The RTMLCY service is a great way to avoid the crowds and queues of Heathrow and Schiphol.
London to Cape Town. Flying first class with British Airways is a hitormiss affair. But having secured a couple of return flights to Cape Town with Avios our expectations were running high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking. Unfortunately Terminal 3 isnt the best starting point and Galleries First lacks glamour or decent champagnes. The food on offer is adequate although hardly first class. Hoping for better on board we didnt use the sit down menu. Boarding was on time and according to BAs new group allocation. Our seats 2K and 3K were a first for us as weve previously gone for pairs in the centre. But seats A and K are definitely superior with more storage space and better privacy. However theres no escaping the fact that the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane particularly when one inspects the shabby state of fittings in the toilets and galley. The IFE is also showing its age and badly in need of an upgrade. But at least it didnt require rebooting on our flight. Cabin crew in first were the usual mixed bag. The FA looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong job. Food was better than usual although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait 30 minutes for our hot breakfast. Landing was ahead of schedule and we were through immigration and baggage reclaim within 15 minutes. Overall a decent flight but let down by the attitude of the cabin crew and the age of the plane.
Just had a very disappointing experience flying Etihads new business class on their A350. First the good the planes interior design is very attractive. Now the bad 1 Etihad uses Air Indias lounge at JFK. Seriously This was one of the dirtiest and least attractive airline lounges Ive ever been in. We left within minutes of arriving. 2 Many of Etihads online systems both app and online just dont function correctly. It was not possible to manage any part of my booking online or via the app. Not possible to choose seats or checkin. 3 While the plane is beautiful scratch and youll discover that beauty is only skin deep. Many of the new planes innovations do no function properly. Outlets dont work the silly builtin phone charger didnt work the entertainment controller was extremely unresponsive and didnt work effectively. Seat was not comfortable compared to other business class seats. 4 The bathrooms were not clean and did not function well. 5 Worst of all on this flight was the service. While the flight attendants were nice enough they didnt provide some of the basic service Id expect even if flying economy. Glasses and water bottles were never collected my empty coffee mug sat on my tray for almost an hour and no one ever thought to ask if I wanted a refill. 6 The cabin was kept ridiculously warm making it impossible to sleep. 12 hour flight without a minute of sleep. In the future I will stick with Emirates Singapore and Qatar when expecting a premium airline experience.
Worst airline ever I paid for extra baggage and on the way back the check in service told me that they will charge me extra because they wont count the sum weight of my two baggage which is by the way less than the extra that i paid for. I even called their customer service before my flight and asked them if they will calculate both baggage together and they said YES on the check in they wanted me to pay extra and said a new rule was made one day before my flight date. I was never informed of the rule by email or message or any way. So not reliable at all even in their own rules.
Nassau to Freeport. Terrible airline. I emailed them for clarification of whether wed be able to fly to Freeport after the hurricane as I was told by separate sources I would not be able to and they just ignored my emails. I asked several times and got ignored. But every time I contacted them with a fresh query someone would respond until I again asked about whether the flight would go ahead and then theyd go silent. They rebooked our flights twice each time not telling us you have to go to their website and login to your booking to find out. One time I had to call them to check because their website wasnt letting me login so I couldnt check the status of the flight. Then the ground crew who checked us in at Freeport airport were rude unhelpful and incredibly unprofessional. Would not recommend even slightly. However you might not have much choice as not many airlines fly to these small islands.
Shanghai to Sydney via Chongqing. The fleet is new and spacious. The thing I didnt like is food for the vegetarians. The food they provide is vegetarian vegan. No provision for the hot milk tea. In the night flight they even didnt provide dental care kit. The worst experience I had was at the Chongqing airport. Our flight from Shanghai arrived Chongqing at 9.25pm and we have to catch Sydney bound flight at 11.10pm. It was a nightmare for us that we have to collect our checkin baggage and then check in back for the Sydney flight. How can one accomodate all this within 2 hours especially when there is no facility for the transferring passengers. We have to walk for 15 minutes outside the terminal to catch a free airport shuttle bus to take us to the international terminal. That was ridiculous and joke of the century. There were no officials present at chongqing who could direct us where to go. The shuttle bus came full and we have to wait for the next shuttle bus very badly managed. Will never fly this airline especially through Chongqing.
Gatwick to Enfidha. We were denied check as we were 4 minutes late this morning and have now been told we will lose our package holiday. This is absurd we were late by 4 minutes only plenty time to clear customs and board minutes late and this is how we have been treated. Told to deal with it with your insurance company.
British Airways from London to Bangkok return. If you are thinking about flying British Airways to Bangkok. Dont do it. Thai Airways or Eva Air for the same price offer a much better service for direct flights. If you want the best go with Emirates but its a stop over flight. I fly this route 20 times a year. Here are the key reasons why you should not fly with British Airways. From my experience I believe they overbook flights so they are always full which increases the risk of being uncomfortable and not flying. The aircraft are very old. If you ask for a snack during the flight the staff love to tell you Can you wait service is in 20 mins this has been tested a few times. They hate anyone who asks for a snack because it starts a chain reaction with other customers. The next service could be in 1 hour but they will still tell you 20 mins. Entertainment is terrible and old and you will also keep accidentally pressing the service button and light with your arm. No phone charger and no USB port. No Wifi. Seats are very old very uncomfortable
Moscow Domodedovo to Dusseldorf. It was good I cant say that it is bad but it wasnt really nice nice crew good food a select of drinks very old aircraft and uncomfortable seats. In fact the price is really low
One of the worst flight I have ever seen. This service is very bad. I traveled 3rd time in this flight with SpiceJet. Every time flight is late and having bad experience. Consider this the choose another flight
London to Sydney via Singapore. Flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic. Meals were great. Leaving London we had a chicken stir fry and landing into Singapore at 1800 we were served an English breakfast which I can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd. At Singapore all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean. When reboarding you had to go through a security check at the gate. We were on the ground in Singapore for 1hour 30min. 2nd leg to Sydney was great also food and drink service was great again. 23 hours long haul flight was comfortable. We had exit row seating for entire flight which I recommend to anyone over 6ft tall.
Paris to Kilimanjaro via Istanbul returning from Zanzibar. The seats are not suitable for a trip of 7h. This is definitely not a business class but it has the price though No registration in advance possible no couple seated together in Istanbul and here we go again in Zanzibar. Staff do not respond to simple requests eg glass of water always returning later but nothing happens later During the stopover in Zanzibar no information was provided customers are left in a staff change cabin and disturbed with the new team that is completely lost. This was a hot mess In summary fly Oman Air or Ethiopian it cannot be worse.
Flight Bogota Lima. Reclining chairs but barely room for my legs in the chair I measure 1.75. I had to pay extra to sit next to my wife. All the time in fear that the bags we carry would be extra charged. Cuzco Lima Not even a USB port to charge cell phone or tablet. Everything including water is charged. Plastic chairs that do not recline just better than those on an urban bus. My wife changed position with a woman since she had been separated from her 5 year old son. Lima Bogota We had to pay 40 us for printing 2 passports. The same fear that the suitcase will be charged extra for passing us a couple of centimeters. Plastic chairs do not recline for a 3hour flight. I did not sit next to my wife for not paying extra. If they could they would charge the toilet paper per square. Really awkward. I understand that it is low cost but the service is poor to miserable. No screen no usb port no water no space no comfort. Everything has to pay extra. In the end it ends up leaving at the same price or even more expensive than better airlines like Lan or Avianca. Vuelo Bogota Lima. Sillas que reclinan pero apenas espacio para mis piernas en la silla mido 1.75. Tuve que pagar extra para sentarme al lado de mi esposa. Todo el tiempo con miedo de que las maletas que llevavamos fueran a ser cobradas extra. Cuzco Lima. Ni siquiera un puerto usb para cargar celular o tableta. Todo incluyendo agua es cobrado. Sillas plasticas que no reclinan apenas mejores que las que hay en un bus urbano. Mi esposa cambio puesto con una mujer ya que habia quedado separada de su hijo de 5 anos. Lima Bogota. Tuvimos que pagar 40 us por imprimir 2 pasabordos. El mismo miedo de que la maleta la cobraran extra por pasarnos un par de centimetros. Sillas plasticas.no reclinan para un vuelo de 3 h. No me sente al lado de mi esposa por no pagar extra. Si pudieran cobrarian el papel higienico por cuadrado. Realmente incomodo. Entiendo que es bajo costo pero el servicio se pasa a miserable. No pantalla no puerto usb no agua no espacio no comodidad. Todo toca pagar extra. Al final termina saliendo al mismo precio o incluso mas caro que aerolineas mejores como lan o Avianca.
I flew from Izmir to Montreal via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. I hadnt flown Turkish in 4 years and was a little worried because of some of the reviews I have read. I had nothing to worry about. The flight was excellent from Izmir to Istanbul on a B777 even time for a small sandwich and coffee on the 1 hour flight. As usual not enough gates at Ataturk airport and we were bussed to the domestic terminal. This should be a thing of the past when Turkish Airlines moves to the New Istanbul Airport in early January 2019. A quick walk over to the International terminal and then boarded my flight to Montreal on a A330300. The flight crew was excellent and had a good grasp of english. They were friendly and helpful. The infotainment system on Turkish is excellent with a wide assortment of movies tv shows and I loved the live TV. Two very tasty meals a good selection of drinks and snacks available in the galley throughout the flight. The restrooms were kept clean throughout the flight as I could see the flight attendants checking them often and cleaning if needed. The return flights were the same excellent staff bathrooms kept clean food was very tasty. The only downside was having to be bussed to the International Terminal at Ataturk and it was pouring rain the stairs had no cover. One of my bags didnt make the transfer to Izmir in Istanbul but I reported it to Turkish Ground Services in Izmir and it was promptly delivered the next morning. Again this problem should be solved when the move to the New Istanbul Airport happens hopefully in early January 2019.
They keep on cancelling the flights. I had to reschedule my itinerary twice before finally cancelling my flight for third time. Avoid.
We landed in Istanbul at the 650 time but only left the aircraft at 715. We had a few mins to make it from gate A4 to F8 and our security checkpoint was only manned by 1 team with a second added for the last few minutes and once we cleared this 750 I ran to the gate making it there at 800. Being informed the gate had closed I was directed to customer service. I was met by 2 rude female attendees who could care less why we were delayed and their response was simply that the hour from landing to take off was sufficient to make the flight and I would need to buy a new ticket. We requested a manager and no manager with the only direction to go to the main desk. When we got here the person attending us once more was unfriendly we shifted computers 3 times to be told go to ticket desk so I asked what is they will do there that you cannot and I was told to buy a new ticket and that he was done assisting us and called the next person in line. Ground staff are extremely rude and I will never fly this airline even though they are part of Star Alliance to which I am a gold member currently. If this is the welcome you give guests I hope someone will read this and think twice about coming to Turkey as the experience Ive had here is awful.
The departure time is scheduled to leave Detroit for 2220. We stayed at the airport an extra 4 hours made our arrival to Amsterdam later than expected. The wait time and fly connections of the trip is terrible. The expected arrival to my destination Beirut was supposed to be 1936. There was too many unnecessaryunknown delays. The food on the plane was disgusting to eat. Will never travel with Delta Air Lines anymore.
Boarded on time but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion. Flight was smooth and quick. Snack and drinks were good for a short flight. Landed only about ten minutes late. One bag of three left in London forms quickly filled in and the bag was delivered the next morning.
I would thoroughly recommend Vistara. We had excellent an excellent check in experience at Amritsar and flights. At Amritsar Dominic and his supervisor helped us redistribute our baggage in order to avoid paying baggage excess charges. Thank you. We had a very tight stop over before catching the flight to Goa. The ground staff at Delhi helped us through security to ensure we arrived at the gate on time. Thank you. The flights were comfortable and a nice experience. Thank you.
Flight on time both ways. Cabin crew are weird giggling through the safety procedure both ways. Bought two coffees 6 and they give you a cup of hot water with a sachet of Nescafe they had no idea why I found this incredulous. They do a lot of playing about with each other and giggling really irritating.
Jet2 an absolute shambles. Upon arriving at Tenerife south airport at 8pm for our return flight home about an hour in we were told we were delayed until midnight when we were told we would be boarding shortly from gate C40. So travel to other side of airport go through passport control to sit there for another hour and a half then was told the flight was cancelled. No other information was gave to us for another 45 minutes just had to stand there waiting. Then had to walk to other side of airport to be told well be getting put up in a hotel for a night and our next flight would be 1pm the next day. Upon sitting for hours until Jet2 sorted out accommodation for everyone we eventually arrived there at about 330am. We arrived at a hotel that could only be compared to the Cecil hotel absolutely shocking rooms. Would give the cleanliness a 110. Had to change rooms as there was a cockroach running about the room. Had no sleep whatsoever then our transfer came which was also late Got to the airport for 11am for our next flight at 1pm. Checked bags in went through security looked at departure board five minutes later delayed until 1040pm. You can imagine how upset and angry everyone was. Another day of sitting in the airport. After waiting all day we then got on a flight at 825pm and returned home a day later than expected. Can only say about Jet 2 staff that they are a shambles. Communication was absolutely terrible. Whilst we were standing waiting on information they just kept saying see it as having an extra day on holiday which I dont understand as wed been in an airport for two days. Tried to claim compensation yesterday and I got back that the flight was delayed due to extraordinary circumstances. Dont really see how thats my problem or my fault. Feel sorry for all the people travelling with children. There was kids trying to sleep on the floor of the airport whilst jet2 were no where to be seen. Will never fly jet2 again in my life and if anyone has any sense they wont either.
Yogyakarta to Bandung. Always delayed no inflight entertainment as promised always said on process of installment even tho its been years bad service staff is rude inconvenient flight times. Had to queue for a long line just to print boarding pass ridiculous. Too bad its the only airline available for some routes thats why Indonesian domestic flights have to use this trash airline. Wouldnt recommend save your energy time and sanity with other options.
If you require to make any amendments ie. cancel ticket change the dates customer service will not pick up your phone call. After paying extra for a flexible ticket Ive emailed and called about ticket refund for a month now and no response. Online option for refund does not work.
Manchester to Los Angeles via Heathrow with British Airways. Pre paid for emergency exit seats for our flight and was allocated these at check in. 45 minutes later when trying to board flight we were stopped and told we were now at the back of the plane with our tickets given to BA staff who were sitting comfortably. It transpires we have to contact BA ourselves to get our money back after filling in a form. This sums up British Airways now as an airline where customers are effectively charged for something they arent provided with and then BA making it so difficult that they hope they get to keep the money customer service is non existent. Other than this all 4 flights we took were late our son was given child meals we hadnt booked the choice of meals was one of only two options both were disgusting one of the seats was broke on a new A380 and the seats were incredibly uncomfortable in that you could feel the metal frame as there is no padding in the seats. An internal Virgin America flight we took had more space and more comfortable seating than BAs A380. I cannot find anything positive to say about them.
On my Ljubljana Munich flight in business class Adria used the CRJ900 Next Generation which is a great plane. I love the very large windows which are at a proper height so that you dont have to bend your neck down in order to look out the window like on the older versions of this Bombardier equipment. Moreover the aircraft is very quiet. Its a short flight but in business class you got a good meal and a comfy seat.
BA191 19th Jan London Heathrow to Austin. Legroom in economy is too small. Im 62 and just dont fit. On a long haul flight recently I sat with my knees sticking out into the aisle and adjacent seat space for 10 hours.
Istanbul to Tel Aviv return. Quick efficient check in for both Istanbul economy class and Tel Aviv business class because I was changing to Business Class from Istanbul. The bag was priority checked through to Bangkok and was first off the flight in Bangkok. Both flights left and landed on time and a light meal served on both flights despite being only two hours long. Seats were okay and I had adequate legroom. Toilets were clean.
I booked a return flight from Manchester to Kolkata and back with Emirates. On the way to Kolkata I missed the connecting flight and used a different flight to reach Kolkata. While at Kolkata I tried to contact Emirates customer service. The Emirates office in Kolkata has been closed for a long time because of Covid so the only way to contact them was through phone. I have regularly called Emirates contact number and waited for hours to speak to an advisor. When I could not get through over the phone. I emailed Emirates twice. Although emails were acknowledged but never got any response back. On 5th December I turned up at the airport for my return flight but I was refused boarding the return flight. Emirates customer service said that my flight was cancelled because I missed connecting flights. Emirates did not make any efforts to contact me or refund my booking. I went through lots of stress just because of Emirates terrible customer service.
Be wary with this airline. Its my second flight with Turkish Airlines. My first one was a few years ago and that was normal. This one was bad. I booked a return ticket from Hong Kong to Kiev via Istanbul but I had an accident in Kiev and needed to change to the next day. The only way to do this was calling the Call Centre. I thought they fly to Hong Kong every day. The Call Center only changed my first flight Kiev to Istanbul to the next day but not the second one which was changed to more than 24 hours after the first one. The staff didnt clearly say there was no flight to Hong Kong on the next day at the beginning. I just noticed that immediately after I paid USD 266. I even hadnt hung up the phone and asked for a change. The Call Centre told me they would charge another sum of money for the change or only refund me USD19. Similar to other passengers complaints this airline pushes to make whatever money they can when you are not alert enough. The Call Centre told me that I was eligible for a hotel stay at Istanbul Airport. But I was denied when I arrived because there was a shorter connecting flight from Kiev to Istanbul. Why didnt the staff tell me that when I made the change To make money this is an airline which doesnt care about their customers.
Flights are usually on Airbus aircraft which is good news for domestic flights. Have flown DMEFRA DMELEDDME DMEKZN all in Economy and some really cheap prices. The food is good and better than Aeroflot. Kiosk checkin at DME is great as is web checkin. Service from staff onboard and in the terminal is good.
Mauritius to London. Just for reference I flew from London to Mauritius via Air Mauritius and that was simply amazing. Now on my flight back from Mauritius to London the flight was via Air France although in the booking it said Air Mauritius Mauritius to Paris and then Paris to London. 12 hours of air time. The flight from Mauritius to Paris was the worse flight I ever had I tried Ryanair once and said never again but after trying Air France I probably would prefer Ryanair So food we had two meals and I know French are famous for their cusine but this was a complete disgrace the quality of everything was so horrible. My wife does not complain about food ever and she couldnt finish any meal the bread for dinner was good But for breakfast it was like a dry ice cube. The staff were arrogant and annoying I dont understand how an airline staff was not trained on common courtesy I dont sleep on flights usually but on a 12 hours flight I can get an eye shut for an hour or two but not with this staff running around with flash lights up and down like Godzilla rampaging through a Japanese city slamming chairs backs not considering or warning the person sitting at the back One positive was for a change I was not the only passenger who couldnt sleep Last big complaint I have from every three announcements one was repeated in English and on the plane the English was really bad English is not my first language either but people can understand me clearly at my job At Paris airport I noted to one of the ladies that they announced checkin but didnt do it in English and I wondered if thats standard procedure. She said I will check sir Went to the lady who was doing announcements and after giggling loud while I was 5 meters away started announcing in French and English. Finally on the short trip to London same thing some announcements in English many without. I fly to Germany via Lufthansa a lot they love their language as much as the French still they always announce first in German and then in English like clock work. Its something that shows respect to their passengers and a simple understanding that not everyone knows German. I could had added other issues such as the cleanliness the old broken arm rests and the inhuman seats. The problem from my point of view was a clear lack of care for the passengers and a lack of professionalism by the staff. To sum it up never again If I was French I would be ashamed that such an airline is representing my country.
Very bad service to deliver baggage. Its been 5 days after arrival and still not yet received baggage from airport. As per the airport staff baggage was supposed to be delivered on third day of travel. From Go Air its a big shame and careless for customers and I dont want to travel with you anymore. At least you need to answer the phone or contact me for the update. Very poor bad service and irritated with your careless attitude. No one responsible for customer queries and baggage and I dont know how you can run the airline in this way.
Truly terrible. Avoid if you can. Whenever I have been unfortunate enough to fly with this company my flight has been delayed or canceled. Never once have things gone smoothly. Once when I was stuck in a city because I missed my connecting flight they set me up in a hotel that was full. And here I am again at the airport knowing Im that I will miss my connecting flight due to a delay. The customer service has been disorganized and rude throughout every experience. Cant wait until they go bankrupt.
Such a bogus airline. I paid an extra 100 for an economy plus upgrade for extra foot space. The unfortunate result is that our IFE screen were not functioning. I asked the flight attendants to fix it and they claimed to restart but didnt. I had to ask 3 times and they started to ignore me. Unbelievable lack of customer service. The customer service email address is a joke too. I notified them of my experience and they offered to provide a voucher for the equivalent amount for the upgrade but didnt provide one after asking 2 times. This is such a joke airline and I cannot recommend this at all. Lack of professionalism and accountability is unacceptable.
Osaka to Bangkok via Singapore booked for March 20th. Singapore Airlines does not give you full refunds or vouchers should they decide. In my case they stated that they have adopted a new travel restriction earlier than the Thailand government required and thus would have to seek some other transport. Today 03.04 they also confirmed a hefty cancellationnoshow fee would be deduced.
I made a reservation for a pet from New York JFK to Baku via Istanbul. I was advised by Turkish Airlines representatives to make a reservation for the cat on the flight with Jet Blue. However when I called Jet Blue to make a reservation for my pet from Sacramento to JFK I was told that the airlines never does this. And it is not allowed. Turkish Airlines representatives should have this information for travelers as it is very difficult in the first place to make a pet reservation on Turkish Airlines. I called the Call center and was told by a representative how to change my reservation. I did this but there was an error in the booking that could not be changed and I no longer had a booking for this flight even though I was not offered any refund or further help. I was told that this case would be reported to customer service and was given a number. I called the customer service back and was not helped at all. I also emailed several offices in both San Francisco and New York and received no response whatsoever. After one week I was told that they would put my case on priority status that it would be handed within 48 hours. After 9 days Turkish airlines has failed To address this situation. And this mistake which their representatives created has not been addressed or rectified. This is the worst service I have ever received from any airline that i have ever made a reservation with. I am extremely dissatisfied as I have no longer have any way to reserve any ticket for myself and a pet in cabin on the airline.
An excellent flight from Atlanta to London with good food and drink plenty of space and a helpful cabin crew. Plane was delayed by bad weather in London but the crew tried to turn things around. The IFE system was one of British Airways newer versions which was very good and its a shame it is not available across the British Airways fleet.
Melbourne to Madrid via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific on Boeing 777 and A330. Premium Economy was very disappointing. Initially we thought that we had mistakenly been given an economy class seat. The toilets were most unpleasant the same as the Economy Section used. Service was minimal. Not worth paying the extra. if you want to fly Cathay Pacific save your money and fly Economy.
Had a great flight from Paris to San Fransisco. Had a hop flight and connected through Paris. Boarding was not that quick though. Had to wait a few minutes in the airbridge which was kind of hot. Seat room was good a bit larger than KLM and Delta on long haul flights. Cabin staff came by almost every hour with drinks. Food was the best I have had on economy during a flight time went by really fast for my opinion. I would fly with AF again
Manila to Amsterdam via Taipei. Customer service and overall experience from the ground staff and the cabin crew are just excellent and way beyond what most legacy carriers offer. Politeness and attentiveness of all EVA Air staff particularly the ground staff at TPE is just extraordinary. An amazing and comfortable journey always with EVA Air. Looking forward to fly with them again.
Flight home was as good as the flight out. Had long delay to depart in part from a missing passenger who checked in then disappeared one of those mysteries about airline travel that happens from time to time. Meanwhile a full plane of passengers were delayed in total by 90 mins. A320 was newly refurbished and clean. So called new Club Europe seats were installed and as I was in row 1 it was okay. The menu was identical to the outbound and the beef main course was was terrific. It was the sort of meal that I would have happily paid 20 for in a quality bistro. FAs were great. The Chinese FA was the sort that understand customer service. Her colleague was closer to retirement and seemed to be on another planet most of the time. At the half way point I wanted another gin and tonic but they had run out of both ice and proper glasses. On arrival to LHR we were parked miles away from the Terminal. No reasons was given. All in all a very good experience.
Newark to Paris. I wish I read the reviews before purchasing my flight with LEVEL. This airline is a total scam Their business model is to lure people in with their inexpensive pricing do not deliver and then deny all responsibilities. Before my flight LEVEL sent me an email to ask me to checkin online. I did and was provided an eboarding pass. Little did I know that the eboarding pass I was provided is faulty and did not work when I was going through airport security. At this point I was unable to find any person working for LEVEL to help me. I tried called the 1800 number and was shocked that the office is closed for the day what legit airline does not have a 24hr hotline So basically I saw the plane took off without me even though I arrived 3.5hrs before my flight. There was another guy that was stranded just like me who cannot even find the LEVEL counter to checkin And he drove all the way to Newark from PA I ended up spending so much more money buying a last min flight traveling for 2 days without sleep to get to my Paris work meeting on time. When I tried to make a claim to LEVEL they denied all responsibilities and did not once address their faulty eticket. This is flying budget at an expensive cost
Before boarding the plane we arrived at Port of Spain airport early from our transfers and we were delighted to be allowed to check in early breeze through security and spend a few hours in the delightful Caribbean Airlines lounge nice and relaxed in there and pretty good selection of food available. Strangely though while spirits were readily available wine and beer were on request which I found a little odd. Boarding was a free for all with passengers ignoring the boarding staff completely much to the annoyance of the gate staff. Upon boarding the plane was amazed to be on a wide bodied 767 which I didnt know flew this route. We were in 2J and 2K and having experienced a slightly cramped 737 flight on the outward leg were delighted with the idea of flat beds and tons of leg room. The flight departed on time and the jovial captain detailed our route. About 20 minutes into service drinks and nuts were served including a perfectly chilled Moet and Chandon before dinner service We had preselected our meals and our thoughts that Carribean serve some of the best inflight meals we have ever tasted were confirmed with a superbly spicy Thai Green Chicken Curry for me and a equally nice Thai Green Tofu Curry for my partner which were served after salads and bread. Salmon and a Beef Pepperpot were also available. Impressive meals that were this months signature dishes Sadly my seat didnt work much so had little chance to enjoy the flat bed however my partners worked fine. Inflight entertainment was equally limited to 5 channels which did work in some seats and didnt work in others which was disappointing. However the legroom and comfort was far superior obviously to the outward journey. Service was polite and understated which I liked from a pleasant crew and we landed on time in JFK. Pleasantly surprised with our Carribean Airlines experience and will definitely use them again on these routes.
Toronto to Beijing. I like the service they provide including the cabin crew and checkin agent they are nice and like to help. During the longtime flying the food is good and bar is open to us where we can stand and chat to kill the time. Besides in terms of hardware Hainan Airlines provides relative new airplanes which provides a great flying experience to us.
Their lack of care lack of support and lack of customer service is monumental. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and heading to Bora Bora. Air Tahiti from LAX to Papeete and then on Air Tahiti regional carrier to Bora Bora. About 2 hours prior to our late night flight Air Tahiti Nui cancelled the flight. The reason was that the incoming aircraft was struck by lightning. Understanding that safety is paramount and absolutely the most important factor of traveling we understood that the aircraft had to be inspected. Keep in mind that Air Tahiti Nui only has like 4 aircraft in their fleet so its not like they can quickly bring in a new aircraft. We were shuttled to an airport hotel at LAX and told to come back in the next day as the flight would now depart at 2pm. Back to LAX we went and learned that Air Tahiti Nui kept delaying the flight with no information or communication to the passengers. When a Gate Agent did appear we were advised that they are third party employees and have no further details. All this while we were watching tape being put on the front of the aircraft where it was struck by lightning. After hours again in LAX the flight finally departed. Upon arrival in Tahiti there was no one from Air Tahiti Nui to provide hotel vouchers as the majority of passengers were connecting to neighboring islands and there were no regional flights out that late. There was a line of about 200 passengers waiting for some assistance from one woman sitting in the Air Tahiti office After hours of waiting we were put up in literally a dump of a motel for the night. Knowing that the flight was cancelled the previous day why would they not have staff ready to assist their passengers as well as hotel vouchers for those stuck in Papeete. Take my recommendation fly an alternate carrier if going to Tahiti. Their Business Class product was terrible. 2x2x2 seating on a 787 where others offer plenty more room. Inflight entertainment was very limited and food was just OK but nothing I would expect from a flag carrier. Internet never worked and while flight attendant service was very cordial it certainly does not make up for their lack of customer service. We lost nights in Bora Bora and I have written a letter to Air Tahiti Nui and the response basically was sht happens. Air France United Delta would be the carriers of choice.
Jakarta to Singapore. I reschedule my flight the following day as day after is the lock down. I Top up more money for the ticket. I was confirmed on the morning 9.20am flight. However I received a email that evening that my flight for the next day morning was cancelled. Immediately there was no line only you got to email. I have no choice but make it the next day for the night flight 20.20. And true enough that morning there isnt any public transport no taxi that day. I get the Hotel reception to assist. Upon check reaching home I learnt to appreciate our Singapore Airlines. They did it. I feel secure upon reaching the Jakarta Airport. A big thank you to Singapore Airlines. .
Sydney to Noumea Business Class. Fast check in at Sydney Airport they use the Qantas Club which was nice. Boarding delayed for 45minutes due to late arriving aircraft. Business Class roomy and seats comfortable not lie flat but very angled. Crew spoke mainly French and some broken English but they are a French Airline. Food good service attentive and friendly didnt use the inflight entertainment. Overall not a bad product.
Flown a total of 4 legs Hamburg to Beijing via Dubai with 36 persons together booked individually. Check In process was rather complicated because of preassigned seats but managed to pack the group together. Luggage drop off in Hamburg was very unfriendly and machine like by AHS staff with shouting throughout the terminal. But Emirates representative was very friendly and helpful with checking in 36 baggage pieces. Flight experience was superb. Several services were offered on all flights and asking for beverages in the galley was possible at all times. Paper menus were offered. Friendly and multi lingual cabin crew on all legs. Very caring for 5 ill kids throughout leg PEKDXB. Greetings and good bye with not only professional smile. We were afraid of B777 10 abreast configuration a bit tight but not cramped at all with 61 height. Living space in A380 was superb. Partly bad reviews could not be verified using Emirates on those 4 legs.
Flew Bridgetown to Georgetown. Everyone mocks LIAT but nothing to complain about. Flight left on time at 1945. All staff interactions were great. No one seated beside me helped as the ATR is a disgustingly cramped plane. Flight attendant came back with a full can of Coke when asked and announcements from the flight deck were exceptional. On arrival bags arrived quickly and it wasnt LIATs fault that the Customs people were so laughably thorough. If LIAT kept this up they wouldnt be mocked.
Mumbai to Riyadh. I would like to convey my special regards to the inflight service attendants. During my last flight in August 2018 from Mumbai to Riyadh I was travelling with my family. During the flight my wife falls unconscious due to low Blood pressure and I dont get what was happening the inflight attendants attended her with no time and did the first aid which helped her to become normal. This is my one of the best experience and unforgettable with the Airlines.
CCPSCLCJC and return with a stopover in CPO on the return flight. All segments operated by A319100 aircraft. Topnotch service on every single sector with complimentary food and drinks. Whereas the main competitor LAN is apparently cutting costs at all edges yet serving only a piece of cake in a plastic wrap or a minuscule bag of peanuts and raisins on national routes Sky still manages to spoil its passengers with a more than adequate snack that usually includes a sandwich a delightfully filled puff roll or pasta with fresh ham a fruit salad a piece of cake bread and some chocolate. We were welcomed aboard their aircraft with a candy which was nice. Departure and arrival always on time or ahead of schedule with no problems regarding baggage which was always delivered promptly. The flight attendants could have been more smiley except for one who stood out providing a very warm service. However they were no grumpier than on other airlines. Aircrafts had been acquired from EasyJet and their onboard equipment is thus basic but they are all in an excellent condition. Considering the airfares and the product delivered Sky Airline has become a competition that LAN Airlines needs to take more than seriously.
We checked on flight radar before leaving the hotel to find our flight delayed but according to the rep it was on time. Getting to the gates was straight forward but we soon realised there was a problem when we found out 4 flights from the UK were all delayed by around an hour. The staff fed us some cock and bull story about why the delays had happened. The gate was rammed with travellers not enough seats for everyone a lot had to sit on the floor. Terrible service Jet2.
We flew out premium economy and back economy from Johannesburg to Kuala Lumpur via Changi. I havent flown with Singapore Airlines for about 10 years so was expecting a very pleasant flight. The aircraft was brand new and it all looked good and it was except for the attendants. I cant really put my finger on it other than it was impersonal efficient but impersonal. They seemed to be in an awful rush to get us fed and watered and turn the lights off. You didnt see them after that at all and we were in premium economy on the way out. On the way back the flight left at 2am and after hanging around in the airport I was hoping for some good food. However it was not too be A sandwich was it You could ask for snacks but who wants crisps at 3am I felt rather disappointed
New York to Manila via Tokyo. The aircraft is really clean but the seat is horrible instead of your back going down your butt is moving forward the temperature is warm and very uncomfortable. I asked the flight attendant for an ice she gave me a soda in a room temperature and told me that they dont have ice.
BA026 7th July Seat 66B. Arrived HK off a connecting CX flight was able to use the QF lounge close to the gate at HKIA boarding very quick and was upgraded to WT at the gate which was welcome after travelling from London to Malaysia and back over 3 days. I like the A380 very quiet seats are very comfortable in WT this being my 5th Trip on BAs 380 departed on time IFE was good however crew and food not the best on this flight I used TG between London BKK and KUL 2 days earlier in economy and the food and crew were fantastic will continue using BA for now but tempted maybe use the Star Alliance again in future.
This was the worst service Ive ever experienced on any flight in my whole life. 4.5 hours over dinner time and theres not even a small beverage included. Not to mention food. We received a menu card at the beginning of the flight with horrendous prices. When I asked to pay by card there was no opportunity given cash only which wasnt mentioned before and we had no more cash with us. So we arrived starving and dying of thirst. The only positive thing to mention is the safe takeoff and landing thanks to the pilot. But the flight would have been exactly the same without any stewardesses on board because throughout the flight they were barely visible and not very friendly with questions and problems. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.
Flew Larnaca to Manchester on the 25th July. Excellent flight arrived in Manchester early after a perfect flight. All crew pleasant and attentive. Food on board was very good also the in flight entertainment. Have flown Cobalt several times and will continue to do so when travelling to Cyprus.
Seoul to Da Nang in January 2020. I had booked my flight ticket with an extra baggage and i also paid for it. But the airline couldnt find my reservation so i have to pay a lot of money for some extra kilos at the checkin counter
Singapore to Auckland via Nadi. Our flight from Singapore at 1055 was rescheduled to 1400 but we were not informed. We arrived at the airport at 0930 and found out the new timing only to wait there for 5 hours. The flight from Nadi to Auckland delayed also from 0945 to 1300. Nadi airport was very basic and noisy. It was terrible to spend 8 hours there although we were given food coupon. Because of the delay we collected our rental car after 6pm so we had to pay late charge of NZD 60. Fiji Airways didnt want to refund us and just offered discount for the next ticket which I was not interested in. Fiji Airways customer service is the worst Ive ever seen. The positive side is the aircraft looks new and very clean.
I just lived through a nightmare because of Turkish Airlines on 711 1 hour before my flight to Lisbon at 700am a Turkish Airlines employee who didnt speak English told me only in Turkish that I was too late without being able to explain why. The only word in English he spoke was closed although I there was still 60 minutes left. I asked and begged for someone who spoke English but no one came and the employee just started talking to other passengers. The same employee directed me to the Turkish Airlines Services where no one spoke acceptable English either. In the process I got so anxious that I lost my ID card which I found later. When my flight was gone I was offered another one to Madrid not my final destination for 1000 euros. In order to go home I had to pay 1600 extra. No reasons given no apologies no explanations just arrogance and lack of basic human decency.
Flight was changed from boarding gate at supposedly 730 pm according to desk clerk I was checked in at 802 and they provided me with the incorrect gate. Missed the flight they did not want to put me on the next plane without charging me a supposed penalty fee. Once I got back to the desk to pay the penalty fee and get the next flight they now they said I had only 30 minutes to do so and wanted to charge me the full amount of another ticket. Not only that then I asked for them to cancel my flight back and they said they couldnt that service was only online. Went online and it said i couldnt because the date had already passed today is 413 the flight was 417. After not bein able to I tried to change the ticket and now they wanted to charge me a full ticket once more. These people are horrible. I was left stranded at the airport at 130 am with no option and no money. Will never ever fly this airline in my life and will recommend for others to no do so either.
I have to admit to being somewhat concerned about booking Olympic Air but Aegean was very expensive in comparison. So I booked 2 tickets tofrom Athens to Heraklion. The website was easy to navigate and the process simple. We did have one slight schedule change on our outbound flight which didnt affect our plans. We checkedin online the day before each flight and printed our boarding cards bag drop was easy to find and our bags were taken quickly. Boarding in Athens a bit late but we made up the time en route. Aircraft in both directions a Q400 which was bright and clean. We didnt expect anything onboard but were surprised to be served a beverage and a packet of nutscookie. Cabin crew were well presented and couldnt do enough. All in all a great experience.
London to Mauritius. The worst flight we was flying as family. Seats was so small 38C D E. Aircraft was so old it had ashtrays there My husband was moved to other seat after we told staff about his DVT but they only acted after we decided to get off from this plain. Seat was so small I actually ended up standing for half of the flight because if person in from of me reclined his chair and I couldnt seat move my knees was trapped. Its was so cold too other people was cold too not just us. I hope air Mauritius will scrap this aircraft as soon as possible.
London Heathrow to Malta. Excellent flight. My only commment is that boarding was chaotic. Boarding should be according to seat numbers with rear seats to be occupied first. Passengers should be asked to be seated until there numbers are called. Also elderly and children should board first. Otherwise one of the best flights I have had.
Canceled our flight after waiting 5 hours due to no pilot then the Orlando staff was rude to everyone had zero accommodations cost us a extra 2000 tried booking us 3 days away from our original flight. I understand things happened but the way I was treated and talked to was unexpectedly
Amsterdam to Tehran via Istanbul. The first flight was with delay we had a connecting flight but because of delay we missed the second flight and they werent responding about that. The staff service was awful it was really a bad trip. We paid twice for our booked flight.
Delhi to London via Istanbul. Travel a lot and in 25 years was probably the worst experience. Planes late and missing connections meaning I am now being rerouted to UK airport where I dont want to go. Understand things go wrong but Turkish Airways are massively unhelpful and are like ghosts hiding in a brand new giant shopping centre pretending to be an airport maybe teething problems but spent over an hour on a overcrowded bus to plane on the way out. Never again for me.
Do not fly with Viva Air. I have traveled with quite a few agencies but this is the most intransigent and unethical I know of on the market. Their economic cost does not compensate for the terrible service they offer. On the Lima to Cuzco route my carryon bag was measured and I was allowed to travel because the excess of 2 cm seriously 2 cm was from the suitcase design. Upon return they made me remove the straps from the backpack because the manager happened to measure the excess with a ruler leaving my backpack damaged. Wait a bit or pay a few more estimated dollars. No vuelen con Viva Air He viajado con bastantes agencias pero esta es la mas intransigente y poco etica que conozco del mercado. Su costo economico no compensa el pesimo servicio que ofrecen. En la ruta Lima a Cuzco se me midio la maleta de mano y se me permitio viajar porque el excedente de 2 cm en serio 2 cm era del diseno de la maleta. Al retorno me hicieron desmontar los fierros de la mochila porque al encargado se le ocurrio medir con una regla ese excedente quedando estropeada mi mochila. Esperen un poco o pague unos dolares mas estimados
The worst flights we have ever had There was nothing to eat or drink the flight was dense and uncomfortable. We will never fly with Air Europa again. Oh And I forgot the 3 hours line we waited in.
Flight was supposed to leave on 04 December at 2030 but delayed due to some technical issues. Passengers were not informed of this until they had been waiting at the gate for several hours. By 0030 we were then informed that the flight had been cancelled that were been taken to a hotel and everything will be sorted the following that we will continue our journey especially those of us who had connecting flights. I understood that. The plane had a problem. However the following day things were worse When we got to the airport while trying to check in again the majority of us were told that our names were not in the system How can that be Kigali was not helpful at all the customer service was practically non existent nothing was working.
Bangkok to Ko Samui. Chose my seat during my booking session which was quite expensive to be honest for an economy flight of just over a hour. Online checkin performed but took a while for my luggage to be dropped off due to a long line for all counters. Security was another extra 30 minutes. Seating at gates was insufficient and boarding by bus about 30 minutes late. Eventually seated with a good legroom. Departed quickly and free hot meal on this flight. No alcohol served. Edible but not spectacular. Landing on time and luggage took a while to appear after we were dropped by cute buses.
Avelo Airlines is another hustling cheap tickets like Spirit and Frontier. It really how you search for cheap tickets if is still available or not. There days that their prices is the same as any airlines. Remember Avelo charge for customer service so another gold digger.
My wife and I travel regularly between West Africa and Europe and about a year ago we decided to try Air Algerie to avoid the burden of Air Frances unpleasant staff and ridiculously low checked baggage weight limits economy 23 kgs. We were surprised to enjoy a relatively pleasant experience with Air Algerie Y class flying recent aircraft 738 and 735s with acceptable delays 1530mns and fast connections in Algiers on both legs for about half the cost of the AF ticket. The only negative side was a cold uncomfortable transit room in Algiers airport on the outbound flight. On that leg travel time incl. connection was shorter than that of AF. Given the above plus the quality and quantity of food served onboard highlighted by others I consider Air Algerie a fair alternative to Air France on EuropeWest Africa routes.
London to Havana via Madrid. I have just finished talking to yet another operator and she tells me that unfortunately she can only check that the file has been sent correctly. Poor thing I would also be sorry to blame the operators who are not to blame for this situation. I have been waiting for 2 years for your refund on a ticket of nearly 600 GBP. My ticket was for March 2020. Following various complaints due to the pandemic I was given a voucher that I could reuse for another hypothetical flight. One year later it was still impossible to travel and think of making another ticket so following the various complaints I was able to speak with an operator with whom I would have started a refund procedure March 2021. I also received an email confirmation for my refund the operator had announced that it would take 5 months to receive the refund and I accepted the continuation I started to contact Air Europa without ever having an answer or an update nothing at all. Its been 2 years now and I still dont know what happened to my money. I also tried to use the voucher out of desperation but it wasnt even valid anymore. I dont know what to do this situation has become ridiculous and also very annoying
Munich to Doha. The Munich Airport ground crew manning the business class queue was rude. When the call was made for boarding for business class then zone 1 I went to queue up. Upon seeing there was another staff manning a counter on the left with no queue I went to her mistakenly thinking it was just another line for boarding. When I presented my boarding pass she didnt bother to take it and said something which I couldnt understand. I decided to go ahead to walk towards the boarding gate. The lady raised her voice and said hey which started me and then said the counter was for business class. I acknowledge that Id made a mistake but she could have pointed me to the correct queue instead of mumbling with no action. The crew on the plane was pleasant and friendly.
This was a smooth experience with Jet2. After boarding reasonably quickly the flight took off about 10 minutes before its scheduled departure and landed in Birmingham about 30 minutes early. The cabin crew were efficient and pleasant. As is common on shorthaul flights there was food and drink available for purchase but nothing was given out free. The only negative thing I can say about the flight was that we had to use shuttle buses to gain access to the terminal in Birmingham. This inconvenience spoilt an otherwise excellent flight experience.
Flight delayed 2 hrs 45 min. Get to Calgary waited 2hrs no luggage appeared. Received next day at 3pm. Now flight home delayed from 3 45pm to 840pm Ridiculous. Had to change bus booked to airport and our pickup in Toronto. Communication lacking. Hoping not delayed again or lost luggage. Never flying with them again On hold 45 minutes still holding.
Jetstar is a very miserable airline. Flight are delayed. On board you have to buy food and also water. Its low cost company I understand but on long flights like the one I had 8 hours they should provide at least snacks and water. If your baggage exceeds for 1 gr the weight limit they will charge you a crazy fee. At the boarding time it was a mess disorganised. Overall Id rather pay more money to any other airline.
SOUACIGCIJER return. Every leg of this journey entirely on Trislanders was a pleasure. No delays from Southampton and pilot was friendly. The same pilot flew us on to Guernsey where after a short stop we changed aircraft for Jersey.
MAD to LCY Business. Great lounge at Madrid flight boarding very good food awful service poor arrival at LCY good however baggage awful all bags through but mine priority last off
Funchal to Gatwick. Due to adverse weather our return flight was delayed three days. When we did fly the cabin crew appeared totally unaware of the fact that the passengers had had a difficult and frustrating time. They were totally unsympathetic and provided a chaotic service throughout the flight. The catering service was absymal no choice of hot meal hardly a bar service and no teacoffee I suspect although the aircraft arrived empty from LGW they hadnt fully loaded the food drinks trolleys. In contrast to the outgoing flight this was a flight to be endured just shows what a difference the crew can make.
Ponta Delgada to Boston with SATA. Flight was delayed 4 or 5 times throughout the day. 89 hours later it was cancelled for technical reasons. They couldnt figure out all day that this one and only plane could not be fixed. Now we are waiting in line for over an hour while 2 yes only 2 people help an entire plane with hotel vouchers. Ruined a great vacation. I will never come back here again until real airlines start flying here. SATA has not figured it out how to take care of its customers. They dont even have a second plane to assist. One guy has been here since Sunday trying to fly to Boston. Its now late Tuesday. Are you kidding me
Never in my life have I been on a plane with such an appalling lack of legroom. Im a 57 tall woman but my knees were jammed into the back of the seat in front and it really was a very uncomfortable 3 hours to Tallinn. I dont know how men or taller people manage but it was shockingly cramped. On the way back I asked for an aisle seat so that at least one of my legs wasnt in danger of getting DVT. Another thing which I found ridiculous in this day and age was that you cant get electronic tickets by email with Estonian Air. I had to pay 15 to have my oldfashioned paper tickets sent by courier because I had booked at short notice. Apart from that the staff were quite friendly and the checkin procedure very efficient. The perfect airline for short people and technophobes
8 hour flight definitely not cheap and they dont even provide water or snacks Incredible Seating is not reclining very uncomfortable It was freezing I asked for a blanket and the hostess said I had to pay for that but they were out of stock Really Its already ridiculous that I should have paid for a blanket but even more so that there werent enough blankets for everyone Also no wifi and no screens not even a big one we didnt have any info about the flight like position ETA Worst flight of my life never again with Cebu
While there was a direct SYDSFO option with UA their price for business class was excessive and my track record with UA in flight service isnt great. So I opted for the indirect SYDHKGSFO routing at a much more palatable price that also helped with my oneworld status. The checkin staff in SYD were great and then immigration and security were empty and I was through to airside in no time. Of course with essentially everything closed at SYD including all the lounges there was nothing much to do. Boarding was swift and we were on our way to HKG in no time. Security at HKG was also empty however fortunately CXs Wing lounge was open. After the mandatory additional security checks at the gate boarding for the SFO sector was also swift. I can only say that the Cathay crew on both sectors were outstanding much like the days of yore when Cathay was one of the worlds greatest airlines. Courteous caring and personable they seemed to want to go the extra mile to ensure everyone was as comfortable as possible. If this review were just about the inflight crew then theyd get top marks however what drags down the experience is the continued deterioration of the CX business class food and wine offering. Most of what I consumed was average at best although the most surprising thing was that a salad that was listed both as a supper option and then again as an anytime option only had one serving loaded for maybe 15 business class passengers. The crew were mortified but could do nothing. I realise things are tough for CX at the moment but why tantalise premium passengers with an extensive menu if you cant deliver on it Offer me less but make sure theres enough of everything to go beyond just one passenger and Ill be happy.
I was on flight G9291 Sharja to Tbilisi flight on 1642023. I found that cabin staff Alexandra was positive and very well mannered. She was managing everything perfectly and it was a great pleasure to watch her go about her work.
March 29 PPT TAHITI FRENCH POLYNESIA LAX LOS ANGLES CA. The flight was horrible. After spending a great deal of money for a business class seat I literally had to get up and go and find flight attendants to get a drink of water after not seeing them for a 3 hour stretch. The food was terrible as well. Not worth the money Horrible service.
Bangkok to Krabi. We were charged 45 for 15kg of luggage which we could not book on in advance as the site keeps crashing as it cannot take UK credit cards When you get to the airport having tried like 20 times to book your luggage on they tell you its 10 a kilo for every kilo beyond their pathetic 10kg allowance. So you have to get your flight so you pay it but when you complain later they just say oh its in our terms and conditions. Just because something is written down in very small print somewhere does not make it fair or appropriate. Shameful ripping off UK passengers on a daily basis.
Santa Marta to Medellin. How is it possible that families are not sat together. Empty airplane and they only have emergency seats to sit us together for an extra charge. So rude and want to charge for everything.
Beijing to Yinchuan. Heard mixed reviews of China Eastern Airlines but was pleasantly surprised. Comfortable seats with ample legroom. Plane was new and looked brilliant in the silver SkyTeam livery. Food was decent although I noticed that they dont offer a drink selection and only give passengers a bottle of water. In terms of IFE you cant expect much when flying within China except a movie or show being shown on the overhead monitors. I was asleep for most of the flight and was pleased with how smooth the ride was. All in all a good experience.
AMSLCY on EMB190. These aircrafts are great for European flights 2x2 seating plenty of leg room. Good service beer and snack on 40 minute flight. London City is a breeze at Victoria station within 30 minutes of landing.
22 flights delayed by at least an hour with no explanation no staff around to ask questions or give an estimated departure time. Overall disappointing experience even though staff were present were courteous.
This round trip flight experience was horrendously poor starting with having to board a bus each way from the tarmac to the aircraft and climb descend a steel stairway in extreme heat. Why can your aircraft not pull up to a gate jetway and board deplane normally What is your malfunction On the return flight to Riyadh we were herded like livestock and squeezed on top of each other into busses and made to sit there for 3040 minutes in 40 degree heat because the aircraft was still being fueled up. Why didnt they just keep us in inside the terminal at the gate if the plane wasnt ready instead of treating us like animals Passengers were asked to show ID and boarding passes at least 8 times I counted from the time we enter the airport until boarding the plane which was delayed because it wasnt fueled. This is an understandable delay and does happen but why subject us to the heat outside If airport busses are shared by airlines they werent going anywhere anyway overloaded and way over capacity. Is this standard operating procedure on FlyDubai especially during a pandemic We had to put our carry on belongings down on the ground when exiting the bus in 40 degree heat and before ascending the aircraft stairway to show ID and boarding pass. Do they think that a random middle aged white woman just ran up on the tarmac from out of nowhere and is trying to board their plane to Riyadh I was asked for ID again for the 8th time as I finally boarded the plane. They switched our seats as well. Our boarding passes did not reflect the seats we initially chose online and someone was sitting in the seat I purchased weeks earlier. Put others in the remaining seats. The flight attendants were very obviously in physical distress from the heat and stress of this fiasco and I was concerned about the one performing preflight safety procedures who looked like she might pass out. As an experienced world traveler I would not recommend FlyDubai nor would I fly them again. The well being safety and quality of flight for passengers is quite obviously not a priority.
Vilnius to Dusseldorf via Riga. Decent airline all good but nothing special. A220 are fairly new good seats plenty space in the overhead bins even when boarding late. Crew professional. Low cost on board product very easy to understand You get nothing included. But that wasnt a surprise as this was made clear during booking an the many upselling attempts via email. Even without buying a seat reservation there were plenty seats to choose from during online check in at no charge. No playing games or hassle concerning luggage at drop off. First leg a bit delayed stopover in Riga within Schengen easy and well organized. Overall decent but nothing great to remember. Can recommend to fly if the price is right.
I had a flight from Norfolk to Ft Lauderdale and they canceled it at the last minute supposedly due to bad weather in Florida checking the weather map there is nothing true. It was the excuse of canceling the flight so as not to compensate since I am afraid that I will have to buy a more expensive ticket because it is at the last minute.
This was not a Cubana Airlines plane but a leased aircraft from Avion Express. Sat in business class in a 22 configuration 8 seats in all. Tons of leg room. The meal was upgraded from the one served in economy. No TV or audio. Luggage allowance was 3 bags at 23kgbag. Flight down left early. Home was 50 min late. I would fly Cubana again.
I have paid a flight from Zambia to Mauritius with Kenya Airways All in one there was no direct flights and have transit flight my flights were 02 Dec Zambia to Harare to Kenya KQ706 03 Dec Kenya to Mauritius KQ270 However on the 3rd December the Kenya crew did not let me take the 2nd flight from Kenya to Mauritius as per her she got a message telling me people who has been in red list countries within the 14 days cannot travel to Mauritius. How come this Kenya airways crew could let me take the flight from Zambia to Harare to Kenya but did not let me take the flight from Kenya to Mauritius and my final destination of this flight was Mauritius this is unacceptable. Also I have paid for this service and the staff at the boarding gate 16 on 3rd December at 11am was not polite and not helping at all and did not talk to me properly.
London Heathrow to Sydney via Singapore. Both myself and my wife enjoyed the overall experience responsive flight attendants and very friendly. Our only real complaint is the food which we found to be rather unappetising and repetitive perhaps a few European or English dishes would be a refreshing change and certainly more welcoming to our palate.
Booked this flight after many years using Easyjet got the flight at a very reasonable price actually cheaper than easyJet. Flight outbound and inbound were ok and although departing slightly late we arrived pretty close to scheduled time outbound landing in Ljubljana was a bit rough. The staff were all pleasant enough and served complementary water a small selection of other food and drink were for sale but some advertised items were not available. Seating is now a bit cramped with even less leg room than Easyjet I am just 6 and my kness were toching the seat in front and were crushed further by the person in front moving and the person behind digging their knees into my back as thay wer oviosly struggling for room too. Much more cramped than the previous time I flew Adria over 10 years ago.
Bangkok to Krabi. My friend and I paid for return flights and hold luggage. We could not check in online for the return journey as their website was not working and when we got to the airport we were told we had not paid for hold luggage. Despite showing a receipt they made us pay THB 3900 and THB 3000 on our debit and credit cards or we could not fly. We both felt totally humiliated and it ruined a good holiday to end it that way. I will never fly with this airline again
Curacao to Georgetown. Arriving by KLM from Amsterdam to Curacao on 25th Sept I was first told that my flight to Georgetown was 3 hours late then shortly that it was cancelled and that I would fly 24 hours later. Upon arrival at the airport the the following evening I was again told that the flight was cancelled and would fly the following morning which eventually did happen. On top of the 36 hours delay the only services provided by the airline were accommodation and meals in mediocre hotels where I met other Insel Air passengers having been delayed five days to go to Trinidad and who had declined the hotel they had first been offered. Ground staff services at the airport were really disorganised and appalling. The MD80 I eventually flew on was clearly very old and shabby. This airline is a disgrace. Reputable airlines and travel agencies should avoid offering InselAir connecting flights.
Delhi to Kathmandu with Nepal Airlines. Tried this airline again after a very long time. I thought after introduction of their brand new A320 they would providing smooth customer service on their new routes. I was wrong. The staff took about half an hour to check us in which is ridiculous. Inflight there are no IFE systems which was expected but there were overhead moniters that came out of the overhead compartments albeit only showing flight status and route duration. The food served was absolutely tasteless. Peas mashed potatoes paneer sticks apple pie terrible and drinks were served. Even though I flew economy my friend flying in their business class complained of the same food dilemma. The airlines magazine was decent. The aircraft interior was very good being a brand new aircraft. The seat was semicomfortable. All over it was a less than decent experience and I wouldnt fly with them again. Id rather choose Air India Jet or Himalayan Airlines on the DELBOM route.
Syrian Air is gradually improving its image worldwide as its retiring all its old B 747SPs and B 727s with Airbus A 330200s and A 320200s. These new aircrafts will have tvs in every seat and business class seating will be way better. I believe that they already have many A 320s operating and the A 330s are arriving this year. After the A 330s arrive it should be a good airline to fly. All that is more needed is improving the quality and facilities of Damascus Airport
Paris to Dublin. Very good overall. Aircraft clean boarding on time. CDG very nice airport huge clean with lots of staff that can guide you. Counting that got tickets only for 49 with taxesa bargain. Since I was flying with my little daughter whos suffering from travel sickness very important for me how smooth landing was on our flight from Paris to Dublin. So a kids friendly rating approved.
CPTGRJ with SAA Air Link. Love this route serviced with a superb EMB135LR. Prebooked seats and check in easy. Domestic side of CPT airport is a pleasant roomy building with a couple of good cafes. Flight called on time and departed on the dot. Friendly and efficient single cabin crew member managed to get through snackjuice service in 40 minute flight even though plane was full. Impressed with her diligence to cabin safety. Captain informative during short flight pointing out way points on what was a stunning day. On time arrival and picked up bags as we walked off the plane. Great little airline.
MXPSIN and return. First time for me with SIA in a very long flight in Premium. Very positive the attitude of the whole cabin crew very kind professional and available to satisfy passenger requests. Food and drink were the same than economy besides they supplied sleeping masks and socks for the night flight only after we requested them. Poor IFE and annoying loud music during the whole descent and until arrival at the finger. All in all very good crew but I suspect that in these last years they lost something regarding the quality they were famous for.
Back in December my family and I as we were getting onto the plane were refused. Even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked 6 months in advance we were refused. It turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldnt let all the passengers on the plane. So quite randomly not 9 people were selected and turned away. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA which I was told I could do and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldnt acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though I booked and paid for the tickets. So I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadnt. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So again I send them the same information that I have done before. AND I wait patiently for my reimbursement. I am convinced that their business model is for you to get so frustrated you just go away. Well you know what I wont.
Sydney to London via Singapore. Fantastic service. Food was delicious I had Indian vegetarian meal and great improvement to last time. The old A380s are the best so comfortable the new ones have uncomfortable cramped seats that I cannot sleep on not as wide as the old ones. Also not sure what the problem is with the cabin air but every time Im in the new planes theres a smell from the toilets. Arrived feeling as though I hadnt flown some 10000 miles.
Johannesburg to Dublin via London. I get to the counter and require a transit visa. Since when and why if you are in the same terminal even. There was no support guidance or remorse from the staff. I also had a non refundable hotel booking in Dublin BA need to communicate such changes.
Seoul to Los Angeles. The A380 is something to just behold the size of the aircraft interior space the onboard store the lounges etc. I was flying economy so I did not get to see the 2nd deck however the photos that are easily available can certainly demonstrate the flying city that the KE A380 is. Customer Service that is provided by the professional staff is jawdropping when compared to US Airlines. The International carriers actually care about the customer and it shows. Service was impeccable in economy. Once airborne the various sections of economy had their own dedicated flight attendants and they ensured each passenger in their area of responsibility was taken care of. The onboard store is a nice touch on such a long flight. The food was outstanding. And I was sought out by the crew about 120min before touchdown in LAX and asked if I would mind moving to 1st class for the remainder of the flight in order to ensure that I made my connecting flight I had a 2hr 10min layover in LAX. Of course I accepted so by the time I traversed the aircraft to the front I had about 1hr to enjoy 1st class. Upon landing I was the first off there was a KE attendant at the end of the bridge with my name on a sign and they took me thru Customs in a expedious manner even though I was Global Entry the KE clearance was much quicker. The attendant stayed with me until I retrieved my bags and I was clear customs and out of the International terminal in about 40min total If you are flying to Asia there are several 5star carriers but KE is at the top of the list.
Bristol to Naples. TUI Airways offer an overall good standard service. Both outbound and inbound flights were on time and the staff onboard were courteous and professional. The seats and inflight service are in line with other shorthaul flights and budget airlines was perfectly acceptable for a 3 hour flight. The only downside was ground crew which were not TUI Airways being a bit slow with the delivery of luggage but that is partly due to the summer peak season. They are primarily geared up for passengers flying as part of a TUIFirst Choice package holiday which means the fares are not great value but since it was the only airline offering this route I was happy to fly with them and would consider doing so again.
I bought 4 electronic tickets for my 2 children one of them already pays as an adult my wife and me for travelling from Barcelona to Florence. I had received the four ETKT numbers long before the travel date and the four of us presented on Barcelona airport well before the boarding time. When we arrived to the counter the agent told me that only three people could travel. The only explanation that he was ready to give was that one of my four tickets had not been issued which was ridiculous because I could show him the four ETKT numbers. Despite I had the four ETKTs he made me call my travel agency who confirmed that the 4 tickets had been equally issued at the same time and suggested me to tell the Meridiana agent that he should try to open the ticket he was refusing to accept. The agent refused to open the tickets but in the end for some magical reason they decided to accept the ticket and we could travel to Florence although the boarding card seemed to be refused by the machines at the boarding room and one of us was seated 10 rows behind the rest of the family. For the return travel I double checked with the travel agency and ticket office at Florence about the validity of the 4 ETKTs. At check in they punished me again by giving me a seat 10 rows behind the rest of my family. The service on board was correct. The punctuality was OK. But can I trust the next time that they will let me travel
Unfortunately my experience on Emirates airlines in economy class from Dubai to Paris CDG fell short of expectations. While I recognize economy class may not offer the same amenities as higher classes I found the level of service and food to be subpar. Additionally at Dubai airport I was required to use an eboarding pass only to be informed upon arrival that a paper boarding pass was necessary causing inconvenience. Furthermore the air hostesses I encountered displayed a lack of professionalism and at times seemed uninformed. Regrettably based on this experience I am uncertain if I would choose to fly with Emirates again.
Bangkok to Krabi. Nok is a true budget airline a little gritty rough around the edges and youre never really comfortable in terms of believing that youll get where youre going on time. I checked in online and bypassed the ticket counter but past experiences have been less than easy. If you dont prepay your bags online you have to check in via one line go to a bag drop and another line then go to a payment counter to pay the baggage fee. Its a pretty terrible system. But this timenone of that. Straight to the gate. Dont expect much in terms of announcements watch for the crowd and go queue up when its time. Their flights seem to require a bus out to the plane and thats your typical budget airline experiencethey try to get all 150 of you into one to avoid making two trips. The aircraft on my trip was old and a god bit worn out. Nok chose to paint their planes in a really colorful scheme I call it Sky Chicken Fabulous with a bird head on the nose of the plane. Unfortunately the colors havent held up well so the appearance of the plane is shabby and faded even from the outside. The crew is quick and a small bottle of water is included a nice touch. The English skills of the crew are marginal for an airline that carries a lot of tourists but if youe heard the safety presentation before elsewhere theres not much that the crew has to talk to you about. They advertise WiFi on board but no Nok flight Ive ever flown delivered on that promise. My flight left late and arrived late but no announcements or apologies were made it appeared to be just part of a normal Nok day. Air Asia is still the cream of the crop in Thai budget carriers with VietJet delivering mostly good results as well. Nok joins the second tier with Lion Air. Nok does offer a frequent flyer program which sets them apart but it requires you to write them and send a copy of your boarding pass to get credit which is honestly just too much hassle to get a free 25 flight. Id fly Nok again but theres nothing that would steer me toward them either.
The air crew members of Flight 1X 442 Muscat to Cochin on 29.4.23 were accommodative and hospitable. Kudos to the air crew team. Especially the airhostess was very sweet in terms of remediating a seat error which had occurred at the front desk while issuing the boarding pass and she went the extra mile by even ensuring that the restroom was good enough to be used after another passenger had used. Food was hygienically prepared and packed and services were professional.
This airline uses the oldest planes I have ever flown. I use Bulgaria Air very often as I fly for business to Sofia from Athens and I have been disappointed several times. The cabin crew is ok but their cabins smell horrible. When there are less than 50 passengers for the route which is very often they bring in propeller aircrafts ATR42 which almost double the time of the journey and offer much less cabin comfort. They change the departure time sometimes without any notification and as it may be up to 2 hours there is no refund of the paid money. For the quality of the meal and the seats I would absolutely agree with previous comments that it is unacceptable when the price paid is equal to this of Alitalia Lufthansa Air France etc.
Asuncion to La Paz via Santa Cruz. Booked these flights through Opodo as I could not find Amaszonas website. Flight to take off 1330 with 50 minute stopover in Santa Cruz but nobody could tell me if I had to go through ImmigrationCustoms and if so in time for connecting flight. Received flight time change a day later now with 2 hours 20 minutes stopover. Received third flight time change a further day later now 0820 from Asuncion with 9 hours stopover in Santa Cruz. Phoned Opodo and asked for a refund but was asked to wait and see if another flight was available. Received fourth flight time change 10 days later take off 0820 from Asuncion with 1 hour 30 minutes stopover in Santa Cruz. Received fifth flight time change seven days later take off 0820 from Asuncion with 1 hour 40 minutes stopover in Santa Cruz. Checkedin for flight and an Australian family was having a loud argument with staff as their flight time had been changed to the afternoon but they had not been informed by Amaszonas. Flight left on time. Yes had to go through ImmigrationCustoms in Santa Cruz. I was the first at both but quite a queue formed behind me. Found Departures at Santa Cruz airport and checkedin for flight to La Paz. Had time for a drink. Dont think the first schedule of 50 minutes would have been sufficient. No complaint when actually on the flights but why oh why did Amaszonas change my flights 5 times. Did not inspire me with confidence.
Flew SmartWings from Tel Aviv to Prague. Not recommended at all stay away Poor value for money. We paid 1725 for 4 tickets and the flight was awful. Beginning with the seats terrible and not comfortable at all worse than a football stadium seat. They dont even serve a free cup of water on a 4 hour flight. Everything costs money and they wont take local currency on our flight back to Israel Long delay 2 hours on our way back from Prague to TelAviv.
Johannesburg to Windhoek. They make abuse of the Coronavirus. Because we cannot go to Namibia at the moment we have to change the dates of our holiday. Air Namibia will charge the normal fee 45 usd per person to change the dates Really unbelievable KLM already did it for free
Mumbai to Ahmedabad. I am a frequent flyer and most of the times my bookings are last minute so I always pay a premium for the tickets. The grumpy ground staff made me stand in a queue for checkin and then instead of issuing a boarding pass they direct you to the self service kiosk for boarding pass and the baggage tag as well. The attitude of the staff was curt. On entering the flight and a till well after take off the AC was not working properly and it was sultry and suffocating and again the reply from the staff that we will try to rectify it. The captain did make an announcement of inflight audiovisual entertainment and out of curiosity I tried it but it was not functioning. The snacks they were offering were some stale veg puff and on enquiring if they have anything else they asked me to take it or leave itk. A foreigner couple were sitting in the adjacent seat enquired if non veg option is available were greeted with a condescending grin and told to prebook their meals if they want such luxuries. Anyway the only good thing was that the flight was on time and on completing this horrid ordeal made a mental note of trying to avoid this airline as much as possible. If youre traveling in India much better to take a low cost airline like Indigo or others. They score over this airline in all aspects are courteous and have spacious seats as well
Narita to Sapporo. This is by the worst airline in Japan. Not only do they not care about their customers the initial ticket prices are a decoy for you to purchase the cheap ticket only to discover later that you are screwed with random fees on things you never heard of. Their website is created to trick you by misinformation and misleading details.
Great experience. The cabin crew Food Seat comfort Wifi all the things were great. Glad to have a safe journey with Vistara. Satisfied with the journey.
BA213 Heathrow to Boston 290914 B747. There was nothing at all to commend this flight. I have had better comfort and service on low cost carriers. The seats must be the narrowest in class for any major airline. The business lounge at Heathrow is not well signed and awkwardly placed at the top of escalators. At 0830 in the morning the tables were overflowing with used crockery and waste food. When staff did appear they did a very cursory clearing job. Never once in two hours did I see any of the sticky tables being wiped down. On boarding I was neither shown to my seat nor addressed by name as I have been on other airlines. When I asked for assistance in putting my hand luggage in the overhead locker I was told in no uncertain terms staff were not allowed to help. Again I have always had help on business flights on other airlines. In the air the level of discomfort rose as those in the inside seats were forced to jump over my out stretched legs and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seats. The level of service could not remotely be considered acceptable for the price paid. Add in poor food and IFE and decision to avoid BA flights in future was made for me.
La Paz to Cuzco with Peruvian Airlines. The aircraft is 22 years old everything worn and aged from chairs to carpet to window blind to toilets. The seat was most cramped. One welcoming think is that they still serve drink and snacks even for an one hour flight. My flight was on time but I observed flights were cancelled frequently. For the daily LPBCUZ route I found 3 out of 7 flights were cancelled. Avoid this airline if you can
My wife and I flew business class upstairs on the A380 Hong Kong to LHR flight BA 26 on the 211214 seats 51 K and J. We found the seats comfortable and the window seat was private with plenty of storage my wife found the reverse to be true of the aisle seat getting out of the window seat is quite tricky. We found the food to be quite tasty. We had the beef tenderloin for dinner which was cooked nicely and tasted very good. The cooked English breakfast was also good. The plane was clean and new looking and the toilets were clean and fresh. Staff service on the whole was reasonable however they did very little other than the main meal services also the head FA was particularly unfriendly bordering on rude. Will we fly BA again after our return on the 23115 Maybe if they are considerably cheaper or Cathay Pacific are full.
What a nice little airline Air Astana provides economy passengers with a surprisingly generous amenity bag which was a nice touch. Cutlery was real metal rare in economy The food was really good and the staff were friendly. This is how an airline should be run Well done guys.
Before booking my return flight from Edinburgh to Southampton I was horrified after reading the unfavourable comments given to this airline that I nearly wanted not to book with it. In the end I decided to fly with them. I felt I need to counter balance those unfavourable comments as they did not reflect the experience I had flying with this airline. The service was reasonably good. The flights Edinburgh to Southampton and Southampton to Edinburgh both took off on time. The inflight staff were friendly and they even served coffee and a small snack. The luggage arrived on time as well. Only thing I could say is some seats on the aircraft looked a bit worn out but for a flight of just over an hour it was not too bad. I would fly with the airline again if the domestic airfare is not so high. Next time if I were to travel to Edinburgh to Southampton I would probably drive as this would save me money. That doesnt mean I would not recommend flying this airline because I would.
The flight service started well with staff being warm and interactive. Aisha warmly smiled and engaged the people around me. She has great customer service and deserved a recognition. I was having red wine and when she did not have any when I asked for it once she found the wine she brought it for me and warmly said that I found your preference The food was not so great and the flight felt congested however the service compensated for some not so good things. Hopefully this message of appreciation will reach her Aisha and her colleague Dams. To be honest as well that Kenya Airways is probably the only airline that offers one of the best luggage allowance making it a top choice while travelling home.
I had originally booked this flight from Zurich to Ho Chi Minh City with Swiss Air. Then I found out it was operated with Edelweiss Air. Im so glad they did. The airline was absolutely excellent. The service on there was first class even in economy you were treated and cared for like you were the only passengers on the flight. I cant praise the cabin crew enough for how friendly they were how generally interested in us and couldnt do enough for us. Food without a doubt the best Ive ever had on an airline. A cheese and meat platter for breakfast was a total wow factor. All meals very tasty. Legroom perfect. Only downside the movies werent great. But by no means does that dampen my incredible experience on this airline.
I have booked a flight to Istanbul on 14th March via my travel agent..But due to the latest development of the Covic19 crisis we decide to pull out on 6th March and sent an appeal via our agent to postpone our trip to a future date. We didnt even request for a refund we just requested to postpone to a future date when it is safer to travel .On 5th March 2020 a Turkish airline plane that landed in Singapore was found to carry a covic19 victim.. So we have every reason and right to protect ourselves and by not travelling to Turkey during this time of crisis. However our request has been turned down. The response from the Turkish airline has been very disappointing and irresponsible no postponement is allowed. They should put the lives of customers above their self interest.
Flew Singapore to Kuala Lumpur with Malindo Air. I flew both ways on the same day and the cabin on both occasions was at least 30 degrees This is inhumane and they did not provide any answers when questioned. All they did was to ask us to be patient. Throughout the flight everyone was fanning themselves but why didnt they bother to maintain their plane
Terrible experience with Aeromexico in Mexico City flight number AM 378 on December 28 2022. First of all they dont even board by zones and second thing I was on zone 3 along side with my wife I paid for the seats I was in. I wasnt even ask to gate check my bag and one of the staff member just pulled me aside and took my bag without asking what zone I was in and than proceed to throw the tag at me really bad experience with Aeromexico will not recommend.
VIEKEF on an A320. Slightly late getting away from VIE landed 20 mins late. Online check in good. Boarding well managed. Seat horrific. Exceptionally uncomfortable for a 4 hour 15 minute flight. Parked at a remote gate and took 45 minutes to arrange a bus to collect us they even managed to bring the next set of passengers returning to VIE to the aircraft before offloading us. A total mess. Despite the huge delay we waited for 15 minutes for the luggage. Appreciate that it was the fault of KEF ground handling but its the airlines choice which company they use. Lack of comfort and ground handling failure will probably mean that I avoid Niki next time.
Ankara to Melbourne via Doha. I booked Melbourne to Ankara via Doha in July 18 but the flight was cancelled due to engineering fault. Reticketed next day for tight connections flights via Singapore. I had booked a premium lounge pass for Doha and as I was unable to use the pass with cancellation and rerouting I tried and was denied entry by lounge staff on my inbound flight. I was told to pay for admission and to put in a request for refund online for unused pass. My request for refund for the unused lounge pass was denied and I was offered a restricted voucher instead. This is a pity as for the most part their flight staff is above average
Would not recommend this airline to anyone. Firstly my luggage was lost when flying from the UK to Vietnam and the airline was not helpful in keeping me updated on the progress locating my luggage. I finally received it about four days after initially landing in Hanoi and was told that I would be eligible for 30 compensation as I needed to purchase essential items that were in my checked luggage. The price of these exceeded 30 even for essential toiletries but this was all they were willing to compensate. However they are unable to transfer the money to me the two options are to either get it sent to a Vietnamese bank account or to collect it in cash in Vietnam. As an international traveller I do not have a Vietnamese bank account and I was not informed of the option to collect the money in cash before leaving Vietnam. Therefore it seems impossible to get my compensation. Second the food and drink options on board are extremely limited and despite trying to request vegetarian meals a number of times before checking in there were no options on board apart from one pot of instant noodles over a 12 hour flight. Furthermore you are only allowed one alcoholic beverage at meal times and there is no option to purchase additional drinks.
Terrible value for the high price we paid. Its almost a 5hflight and theres no food offered during the flight plus my husband and I booked our ticket together and not only were we not seated together but each of us was seated at the opposite side of the plane. They didnt even try to put us close. I wont even talk about the very basic comfort of the airplane. Will always avoid that airline in the future its like throwing your money away.
Yet another fantastic experience with Qatar Airways. Check in service at Heathrow was an absolute pleasure. Services onboard QR 010 on 7th September provided by cabin crew was second to none. They were a fantastic cabin crew and was absolute pleasure flying with them. Thank you very much.
Cebu to Dubai via Hong Kong. The flight was delayed by more than an hour in Cebu but the consolation is that we were upgraded to Premium Economy for CebuHKG route. I hate delayed flight they did not provide any drinks or snacks fortunately I have access to the Premium Lounge courtesy of my MC. The flight was comfortable the legroom and the seat pitch was good enough. The HKGDXB route was not quite interesting food served was bland and the plane cabin was not neat as expected. The handling of the crews aboard the flight is very average.
Internal flights in Chile to and from Concepcion. All flights on time. In service quality good. No problem when extra drinks asked for. This is our second time with them and would definitely fly again.
I traveled with Insel air June this year from Aruba via Curacao to Suriname. At the checkin counter I asked the lady to label my luggage all the way to Suriname. In Curacao I discovered that it was not done and since I was in transit they had to intercept my luggage and change labels. After 2 hours and repeatedly asking it was finally done. We had a delay of approx. 1 hour. The aircraft was pretty old and packed with embassy and refinery people and there was a fight about a seat police had to escort a couple off the plane which resulted in another 45 minutes delay. Cabin staff mishandled the issue and shouldnt have allowed the back and forth scenario. My return flight date had to be postponed so I sent Insel Curacao an email followed up with calls to Curacao but the person in charge was never available. After a lot of calls and emails we never got an answer. I decided to fly SLM back to avoid more issues with Insel Air.
Booked flight with Frontier 3 weeks prior. Checked in 10 hrs before take off. Received notice flight was hour and half delayed. 3 hours before boarding received notice flight was canceled. Went thru all options no offer to assist with another flight no phone number to get a Rebooking website routing just kept popping up with do you want a credit or a refund. Tried for hours only could reach robots with standard response like go to manage flights Cant manage a canceled flight Kept trying every avenue. Finally 6 hours later after booking a flight that cost 6 times more than my frontier flight I asked to write a complaint I got a chat agent that gave human responses which were Sorry we had to cancel flight we do this to ensure passengers safety Sadly I do not see where you contacted us. When I asked for help getting home rep offered me a flight 3 days from my original date at twice the money... Word to the wise. If you can afford another airline take it. If you have to fly frontier take snacks and water they wont give you anything and may strand you and they will not help you to your booked destination. By the time they cancel you could have booked first class tickets on a dependable customer friendly and professional airline. As I told frontier I may be slow but Im not stupid. Booking with frontier is a gamble but you will eventually loose
Bombay to Copenhagen via Doha. The aircraft on both flights was equipped with Qsuites. The onboard experience was flawless on all fronts seat comfort service meals and WiFi. While the Qsuites are outstanding Qatars more traditional Business Class configuration is as good or better in some respects. The experience outside the aircraft was far less impressive. Our flight from DOHCPH was delayed by 6 hours and while the Qatar personnel were very friendly there was no clarity in their updates. The Al Mourjan Lounge in Doha during crowded hours is unpleasant they should fix this.
Flew Gatwick Zagreb on a modern new to fleet aircraft 2nd April very good flight good leg room meal was tasty with free wine coffee or soft drinks very welcome. On the return leg Zagreb to Heathrow two weeks later flew in an older plane with extremely good leg room courteous staff and once again a tasty meal with free drinks no inflight entertainment but a travelog of Croatia was playing on the overhead screens.
I flew CUNHAVCUN with Cubana in November 2014. Inbound flight was delayed for 3 hours due to bad weather in the region. Service was average and no entertainment onboard but it is a 1 hr 20 minutes flight so I did some reading. Outbound flight was on time. Good value for money but do not expect nothing fancy.
I was told on the Saturday that my hand luggage was fine the right size by BA staff at Geneva airport it was physically inspected. Then on Monday I was ordered to pay 65 83 Francs. Staff at the airport were insanely rude to be honest the supervisor particularly. Their customer service is also awful. Its a joke of an airline compared to competitors like Qatar. When filing a complaint they did not respond for 3 weeks. They only responded when I chased them up said waiting time is actually 4 weeks. Can you believe that The explanation was their IT system failed in May 2017 an internal matter which they clearly still not resolved.
First the flight was rescheduled 6 hours from original departure time. Flight was faster than expected. Thats OK we had to wait on the plane for an hour to disembark. With an additional hour to wait to go through customs. Never fly Silver Airways.
2332015 LHRSIN BA011 First. Awful from booking to completion of the flight. As a BA. Gold executive member at time of booking some 11 months ago booked this flight on the new A380 only to be told by BA in May 2014 the equipment had been changed to the extremely old 744 due to technical issues. Sold feeling a little let down secured seats 1a and 2a on the 744 these are the best of a bad bunch as to I wonder why BA squeezes 14 seats into such a small area where other airlines only fit 8 seats into the front sections of 744s. At the beginning of March I checked the booking online only to find that we had been moved to row 5 in the middle this was not acceptable. I called the BA gold line to object only to be given numerous contradicting excuses non of which were valid whilst on the flight I found out that the passenger in 1a was a lifetime gold member so. I can only assume that rank has its privileges. Now onto the flight arrogant staff with one exception really poor food served at different times as we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to us. Plane interior shabby not surprised for a 20 plus year old plane along with the PA being inaudible I felt this to be a safety issue and when mentioned I was ignored. I booked this flight for us a part of a special Far East holiday I had high expectations of BA First which have not been met in anyway what a total waste of money. Will now try to avoid flying BA in any of there classes once I have redeemed my Avios balance.
Hong Kong Airlines uses two types of planes on their Hong Kong to Bali route. An A330200 which I flew on as well as a newer A330300. The 200 series has a 222 configuration in business class with angled lieflat seats which is good enough for this 4.5 hour flight. The service is good and the food choices reasonable. The IFE is old with not many movie choices but for a regional flight thats quite decent. This was my first time flying them and I was pleasantly surprised. Although next time I will try and fly on the A330300 which has a more modern 121 lie flat biz class seats.
I flew to Toronto form Montreal with Flair on March 10th 2023 and upon arrival in Toronto I realized that my suitcase did not arrive with me. I was told that it was left in Montreal and that I may receive it by March 12th. Now I was in town only form 1013 for a Wedding. Obviously I did not receive my suitcase while I was in Toronto so I had to purchase new closes to wear to this wedding. My suitcase was only found and returned to me on Mar 23th. I was told to contact them if anything was missing from my suitcase as well as to be reimbursed for the clothes that I had to purchase. I emailed them on March 29th providing all the details of what happened as well as my receipts. They responded with a generic message asking me to describe what my suitcase looked liked they clearly didnt even read my email since I already told them that I now had my suitcase. I have been emailing them back and forth since then and every time I do I get a new person asking me to describe what my suitcase looks like. I have yet to receive an email from someone who has any kind of customer service training or experience. Its been two weeks since they bothered to respond to my last email. Clearly they dont need any customers. I will never fly with Flair Airlines again even if it was for free.
Munich to Bologna and Pisa to Munich both on an Embraer 195 economy. Both flights handled efficiently southbound on time northbound delayed by about 25 mins on departure due to to late arrival of incoming flight there had been thick fog at MUC early that morning which had sent things adrift for much of the morning. However support given to those with tight connections. Modest inflight service snacks and drinks wine came in proper glasses. Air Dolomiti worked okay for us.
Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to Stay hydrated. We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding.
Bengaluru to Mumbai by Vistara. Today I tried flying the new feeling for the first time and I was very impressed. I had checked in online for the flight and had the printout of the boarding pass however during check in I was really happy and appreciated with the check in agent Vidhya who was kind enough to give us an extra legroom seat for our flight which was not chargeable and that was hugely appreciated. Boarding and departure was well on time and the seat was quite comfortable and soft. The extra legroom seats were very comfortable and it was also a pleasant surprise to know that the airline have also started resuming their inflight meal services which consisted of a veg sandwich cookies and a bottle of water. There was also the inflight entertainment Vistara World which was accessible from the devices but I didnt go through it in detail although it seemed it had a decent collection of bollywood hollywood movies. Arrival was ahead of schedule and baggage retrieval was also very smooth. Overall I have to say that this was an excellent flight service for such a short journey I can only imagine how much better flying on premium economy business would be. If one is looking for comfort and luxurious flying you wont be disappointed with Vistara. I might travel in Premium Economy or Business in the future if possible. Highly recommend it.
NewcastleBirmingham. Flew out and back on a Saab 41 Turbo Prop with 29 seats. There was surprisingly a lot of leg room which was welcome. One member of cabin crew was very efficient and the captain kept us up to date when we encountered a 20 min delay. On the short flight we were served complimentary drinks and snacks. Very good professional airline.
My flight was Sapporo to Bangkok but I had to transfer on Hong Kong about 24 hrs. For first 24hrs I accept to wait because that was the ticket I bought but the airplane was delayed after that. I asked them as I want to get a shower but they say no and give me a voucher for food. The flight still delayed so they gave me a second voucher food which mean nothing to me. Im disappointed didnt fix the problem properly to me.
Terrible checkin experience. The flight WE588 was scheduled for 7.45am departure. I arrive at the airport and straight to checkin counter Row G since 5.30am. However there was already a very long line of passengers to checkin for the morning flight for international route while only 34 counters were opened. One counter for online checkin counter was opened with very short queue of 1015 passengers. Unbelievable it took me 45 minute to reach that counter to have my passport checked and receive boarding pass. There were staff sat at the closed countered but only for passengers who nearly miss the flight because of waiting too long for check in. This is irresponsible of airline management. They do not care about passengers at all. The boarding was late as usual for Thai Smile. Take off time was more than 15 minutes late. Inflight service was nothing special. Food was unacceptable as usual. They still serving pie with sloppy soft and moist pie crust which should be flaky pie crust. Also they overused packing. To serve a small piece of bad pie and 100 ml of tap water they use 2 thick paper boxes.
Edinburgh to Fuerteventura. I would just like to say a big Thank you to jet2 who I think without doubt are the best budget airline I have used again and again and i have tried a few enroute to Fuerteventura. Staff fantastic and polite and space in compartments and seating for what you pay is above any other.
Budapest to Dubai. A regular traveler to Emirates I was very disappointed once again by this companys sharply lower performance. The welcome on the plane is expeditious the smiles rare. We had two hostesses one obviously beginner shy to the point of not being able to look in the eyes while talking to us and faster than lightning the tablecloths are literally thrown on the shelves the drinks served without presentation she ran most of the time like most hostesses. The dishes had little flavor. Only positive points the quality of the wines including Champagne and the plate of cheese. The device wifi control of audiovisual instruments did not work despite the repair efforts of a hostess much more experienced pleasant and smiling that we saw that during the claim. The limousine service promised in the price of the ticket is nonexistent in Phuket for reasons never explained and the car provided to Dubai was the worst dented on its flank must while we have well reminded the hostess of the counter. we were theoretically entitled to two cars having two separate tickets. It will be I hope our last experience with Emirates happily competing on the same lines. FR Voyageur habitue de la compagnie EMIRATES jai ete tres decu une fois de plus par les prestations en nette baisse de cette compagnie. Des lembarquement assure a Phuket par des employes de la THAI AIRWAYS on est traite comme des animaux pas de sourire en vue. Laccueil dans lavion est expeditif les sourires rares. Nous avons eu deux hotesses lune visiblement debutante timide au point de ne pouvoir nous regarder dans les yeux en nous parlant et plus rapide que leclair les nappes sont litteralement jetees sur les tablettes les boissons servies sans presentation elle courait la plupart du temps comme la plupart des hotesses. Les mets navaient que peu de saveur. Seuls points positifs la qualite des vins Champagne compris et lassiette de fromage. Le dispositif wifi de commande des instruments audiovisuels ne fonctionnait pas malgre les efforts de reparation dun hotesse nettement plus experimentee agreable et souriante que lon a vu que lors de la reclamation. Le service de limousine promis dans le prix du billet est inexistant a Phuket pour des raisons jamais expliquee et la voiture fournie a Dubai etait la pire cabossee sur son flanc doit alors que nous avons bien rappele a lhotesse du comptoir daccueil que nous avions theoriquement droit a deux voitures ayant deux billets separes. Ce sera jespere notre derniere experience avec EMIRATES heureusement concurrencee sur les memes lignes.
Terrible experience. We were scheduled to leave out on a 7 am flight. Received an email at 10 pm the night before that the flight was delayed 6 hours. Luckily we happened to check the email. We logged in and the sun country website said the flight was on time and not delayed. Called customer service and what a terrible customer service experience. They could not confirm either way if it was delayed or not. We arrived at the airport for the 7 am flight just to be safe. The agents at the ticket counter told us the flight was on time so we checked our bags and went thru security only to find out once inside that it was actually delayed 6 hours. Now we were stuck and couldnt leave. We were stranded for 6 hours when we could have gone back home and waited if they had given us correct information. We live 30 minutes from airport. The delay caused us to lose deposits on scheduled activities because we didnt arrive on time. I have attempted to contact Sun Country customer service several times and Im promised a call back but no one ever calls back Terrible experience. Avoid Sun Country at all costs
Birmingham to Sydney via Dubai Bangkok. Very disappointed with the inconsistent service at the airports. Birmingham ground staff and cabin staff were miserable and sarcastic. The journey then inproved from Dubai to Bangkok. We stopped at Bangkok for a couple of days and then onto Sydney. The plane was cramped hot and uncomfortable. Long delays getting our luggage off the plane. I was expecting a lot better from emirates and the A380. Will be looking to fly with another airline in future
I bought a very cheap return flight from HKG to CDG via IST for my summer holiday. There was one minor schedule change before the outbound flight but this wasnt inconvenient departure was brought forward by 40 minutes. Document checks at the checkin counter and the gate were efficient. Upon boarding the aircraft the crew handed out a Covid hygiene kit that included a quality face mask small bottle of gel and some wipes. Turkish Airlines is making a big play of its safety precautions with dedicated videos and the kit. The crew were professional and friendly. Dinner and breakfast were very good main meals come with a small serving of hummus which is very pleasant. Transfer at Istanbul airport was easy and worryfree. The ISTCDG flight was packed but service standards were still good. On the basis of flights flown Turkish Airlines didnt disappoint. My return flight scheduled on August 7 was first subject to a schedule change to August 22 four days before departure and then cancelled altogether which obliged me to make alternative arrangements which I was going to do anyway to navigate the constantly changing Hong Kong entry and quarantine requirements. Hopefully there will be a partial refund at some stage.
Larnaca to Athens. I fly Aegean twice weekly almost every single week of the year. And I could say that 90 of the times their flights are delayed specially the ones towards the end of the day. And it is not due to the overall mess that happened this past summer Im so many European airpors. I can understand that delays pile up along the day but knowing that this happens they should review their schedules. Or try to catch up during the flight. The excuse is most times the same the ridiculous late arrival of the aircraft thank you. Their app is also faulty lately you call then show them and still dont accept it things like not being able to check in wrong pricing information no incoming messages with flight delays etc. Also when they change planes and they cannot relocate you in a pay seat you have to call them to get a refund What they dont miss is to send a a silly survey upon landing asking about the quality of the service on board forcing you to chose an area of improvement while not asking for the endtoend experience from reservation check in baggage drop boarding disembarkation luggage. They deserve some competition theyve simply got worse in service unfortunately for those of us hooked to them.
I was very disappointed how I had to pay 50 for a carry on my son was in a wheelchair and could take his own bag. The employee didnt believe me and made me pay. I had purchased 6 tickets and would never fly with this airline again.
An airline that lives in their past glory and heading a future of crisis is British Airways. I am not joking we are a family of 7 all in Business Class heading for a Norwegian and Arctic Cruise and they lost 10 of our bags They will never see me on any of their flights ever a disaster of an airline
First time flying with Batik Air from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta and it is such a hassle. You have to check in at the counter since online check in is unavailable. During checkin at the counter the queue is unorganized which caused confusion. I needed at least 30 minutes to just to get checkedin. During the flight the seat was okay and looked dull. The seat incline is the same as other lowcost airlines seat. During meal time there are no options and I received pizza like bread and a muffin with a cup of mineral water. It is terrible.
Athens to Kefalonia. Flight was a little late but the service was good for a budget airline we purchased extra baggage which was a good price which came with the added bonus of a lounge pass at Athens airport a free drink and biscuit was also supplied during the one hour flight
No in flight entertainment. Inconvenient food ordering system that has to be done in advance. People who had flight delayschanges with kids and planned to get food in the airport were at risk of having no food available because of the limited amount they had for those who didnt order in advance. My flights were either extremely hot or extremely cold. The first class seating had broken charging ports that had coffee spills on them. Stewardess simply said 3 of the first class chargers are broken out of 8 so the two of us in my row are out of luck. The tray between the two first class seats was just gross. Dirty. The ticket counter was absolute chaos both on the way here and on the way back. Half of the self serve baggage tag printers were out of paper resulting in long lines and lots of anxious customers. I dont get it. I wouldnt normally add a review if I thought my experience was an isolated one but there seems to be a lot of shortfalls all over the place with this airline.
Gatwick to Faro return. Having flown Monarch many times and not had a problem we were surprised to be delayed firstly when boarding and then again whilst waiting for our slot. Not only that but upon arrival at Faro an ambulance arrived to take a disabled person off the back. Instead of opening the front and letting us all go out that way we had to sit yet again why Coming back from Faro we were shocked to be told that extra legroom seats were 32 euros each We declined but were happy to find that our return flight was on a new plane with the slimmer seats this means there is extra legroom anyway. I would be interested to know why they dont restock with sandwiches for the return leg We had our own food but there were a lot of unhappy golfers on board because there were no sandwiches to be had at all.
JetBlue is just simply unreliable and your time is valuable. The website is so glitched you end up calling a clueless helpless reservation agent. If you do manage a successful online transaction with an actual confirmation code be sure to triple check because chances are it will be an incomplete record because the payment process never works. We find this to be specific to the seat assignment or extras. You book your flight you pay for your seat upgrade you show up to the airport in plenty of time and then delay delay delay delay .. andor cancel. Save yourself the expense and aggravation.
TIPBEN on a nearly new Canadair regional jet with leather seats and decent pitch. Very happy with the short flight. New terminals are being built at both ends sorely needed. Otherwise would fly them again
Frankfurt to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. Ground service in Frankfurt was very helpful and nice. Both legs were on time seats comfy staff was very friendly. I had glutenfree meals my husband normal food. Both were excellent. The movie choice was rather good though including some very old successful films that must be known to everybody. Only complaint on the leg DohaBangkok my entertainment computer stopped the film every now and then and rewinded till I pushed the playbutton. I tried two other films the same.
Left on time and arrived early which was a pleasant surprise. Friendly service. The seats seemed a little on the hard side but that could just have been me.
Santiago to Arica return for holidays. It was a nice experience to fly the newly turned lowcost Sky Airline from Chile as the competition for this route had the double price. Only 1 checked baggage allowed as compared to 2 for.most South American airlines was enough. The prices on board for beverages and snacks were not that high as compared to the European low cost airlines and with the exception that when we landed to Arica we had to wait more than one and a half hours in the plane because somebody forgot hisher luggage inside the terminal and the police had to check it for a bomb this was what we were told afterwards in the airport both flights were on time or before schedule flight attendants were very helpful and friendly. There was a lack of entertainment on board.
I have just completed a round rip from Papeete to Osaka via Noumea with Aircalin. I was extremely surprised by the quality of service provided onboard and on the ground. I flew their Hibiscus Business class PPT to NOU then coach and I have to say that Aircalin beats several major airlines I have travelled with during the last few years. The plane used was a brand new A 330 aircraft and once onboard you can expect to be greeted with warm and friendly smiles from the flight attendants. The food was plentiful and varied. The entertainment system was tip top. All in all for very long flights a generally pleasant experience would definitely consider flying Aircalin again.
First time I have used Eastern Airways so wasnt quite sure what to expect however I was very pleasantly surprised at the experience. The price was 98 return LeedsBradford to Southampton. This is about 40 more than the cost of driving. It would also take 10 hrs in total driving especially through roadworks on the M1. The flights were both on time and took less than the scheduled 65 mins. Check in staff very efficient including fasttrack through security nice touch. Price also included a 15kg suitcase. Complimentary mints handed out at take off and landing also offered complimentary drinks and crisps during flight. When was that last offered on a domestic flight on budget airlines The plane as an older turboprop plane but clean and comfortable with lots of legroom. I will certainly use again and thanks to all the staff for restoring my faith in air travel as we all know how tedious it can get. I actually felt I mattered as a customer for once. Well done guys.
Flight on time. Smooth cooperation with their partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. Luggage transfer went smooth arrived quickly in Hanoi. In Doha I had 12 hours layover I was eventually denied a hotel stay but had lounge access to their decent Platinum lounge. Onboard recognised as elite traveller and was well pampered by professional attendants. They secured me 3 seats in a row by applying seatblock for me as elite flier. The plane was not fully occupied as this is a new additional flight on this route. IFE of high class and movies renewed frequently. Food onboard improving for QR 3 offerings at dinner of which I had two dishes of beef which was excellent. Beers were of ridiculous poor quality wines were fair including a sparkling Spanish cava. The wineglasses are so small that they embarrass the passengers. They hold 58 cl only. The wineglasses on my previous flight Rwandair are 4 times larger. Amenity kit given though rather useless. A hot snack was offered before morning landing in Hanoi. Recommended cant demand much more for economy class. But bring onboard your own slippers and headset. Qatar Airways tickets have become too expensive during Corona.
The flight was delayed and under EU261 my hubby and I were owed 600 Euros each. I started requesting my refund on July 13th. It is now September 15th and still nothing. I was told over a month ago that the hubby and I qualified for a refund but nothing. I have called over 30 timesuse their help request format and filled out their feedback over 20 timeswas told to contact the Miami office which has no phone number so you can only contact via email. Emailed the representative from Miami 38 times to which I have received 9 replies which offer very little help. Last I heard from him was September 1st asking me where I wanted my refund transferred to. Well its now September 15th. I have c but he also has not replied to the numerous emails that I have sent him requesting the status of my refund. I have had so many problems with this airlines. After purchasing seats so that the hubby and I would get to sit next to each other our seats were not given to us. Had to call several times to fix that problem. Some of the stewardess were plain rude. One of their phone reps told me to shut up literally. Overall the worst customer service I have every experienced. Only pro Food was good and plentiful on the plane.
Flew LBA to BRU at the beginning of May. Both flights on time planes clean efficient service. Would definitely use again. Unfortunately our return flight was BMI regionals last flight into LBA so this route on longer exists.
Bangkok to London for myself and two children 50205 flight delayed 2 hours from Bangkok no explanation given On boarding found no one at the entrance to plane so just wandered on and found our seats. Two of the three were broken and could not recline. A passenger behind us could not find her seat as shown on boarding pass. Eventually cabin crew discovered that the seat on aircraft did not exist and had to cross out a seat number using felt tip pen and write correct number up above. Overall impression of interior was very unpleasant and dim hardly any light at all due to the very old aircraft used and no updating of interior. After taking off no hello from captain or any communication it would have been courteous to know what the delay was . We never heard his voice throughout the flight. After arriving in Dubai the hour hour turned into 2hours 15 minutes no cabin crew would tell me what the delay was for although I did see a Phuket Airlines engineer inspecting engines. Took off for final leg at least this change of captain did mean that we heard his voice and he at least apologised for the 2 hour plus delay. I should mention that during the stopover the engines were off and no aircon inside cabin which left most passengers very uncomfortable. Food was of low quality and beer i asked for was warm and not refrigerated. Crew were ok especially after seeing what they have to put up with. On arrival at Gatwick had to wait exactly 60 minutes for bags and with the extra delay of flight meant we missed our coach we had previously booked. Total flight time 18 hours 21 including arrival time at Bangkok as we were told to arrive 3 hours before boarding After travelling for 20 years I can honestly say that this has been my worst experience ever and has put me off flying especially with children. I have to return to Thailand and would not fly Phuket Airlines if I was given free tickets the whole experience from check in to arrival was most unpleasant.
My flight was May 6th 2022. The day before the flight they email me that the flight will be delayed to 240am instead to the original time which is 145 am. I checked in and waited for the time in front of the gate . But when I checked at the flight information board they re timed it at 320am not sure for the exact time and boarding gate changed too. As the time nearing they change it again to 400am and lastly they change the time again to 520am. They retime the flight 5 times. Its very upsetting. I went to the airport early to avoid the queue. Ended up staying in the airport for 8 hours before boarding. They delayed the flight without anyone talk to us what is happening. We are all tired. And we dont have a choice to sleep on the chair and floor.
Bangkok to London via Doha. Check in at BKK was quick and easy offered fast track immigration and lounge access with my FF status QR use the Thai Airways lounge in satellite E which was packed so I didnt stay long. Boarding from E1 was organised and very early completed 30 min before departure time I was a bit sceptical using the 777300ER because of the 343 seating my previous QR 777 flight was only 25 full so comfortable but again this flight was only 50 capacity so had 3 seats to myself 12A. Aircraft was clean and tidy and departed before scheduled departure time. Once airborne a pretty decent breakfast served along with drinks and a hot sandwich 1hr 30 min out of DOH. This 7hr flight was great I managed to sleep 4 hrs. I only had 45min to transfer at DOH although it was plenty of time with the flight to LHR departing from the next gate. My first time on an A350 and what a nice aircraft lucky enough another half empty aircraft in economy so once again I had an exit row to myself 30K. Departed on time and again food served within an hour of departure the flight went quickly great service food was good for economy. The aircraft is great very comfortable. Arrived on time with bags waiting once through immigration. the best 2 economy flights I have had for many years. Clean aircraft great crew good food and great value for this trip. Still my favourite long haul airline.
Lion Air manages to constantly disappoint even when expectations are extremely low after flying with them from time to time the last four years. Planes are often canceled and almost always delayed by hours. Information is scarce and the unfortunate personnel is constantly stressed to make the best of a horribly managed airline. All other airlines in Indonesia are better. At the very least you would expect to get to where you are going this is not always the case with lion air as they frequently cancels flights and good luck getting refunds. If they do fly that day you can expect a delay of 16 hours. Again forget any compensation which they are legally required to provide. During this inevitable delay expect to get zero information. Id literally go to the counter and ask if the plane will be on time 20 min before and they say yes. When I ask if the plane has arrived yet they do not know and when they check its still somewhere else. I then ask when it will arrive to this airport and the staff would then sms or WA the ground staff of the previous airport asking when the plane left. When the plane do arrive at the airport it will have missed any slot it was allocated and get allocated a gate on the other side of the airport. Due to low prices lion air is the only airline trafficking some destinations. Try to avoid always pay triple to do so if you can its always worth it.
TallinnKievTallinn. Using Estonian Air is like using a scheduled bus service in best case. They will get you from A to B without any amenities. Estonian uses B 737500. Seat pitch is average. Both flights were on time. Luggage arrived as well. On board service has to be paid extra. For a flight of about 2 hours this is not much. I use them because it is the only direct link between Tallinn and Kiev but if there was any quality airline I would prefer them.
My flight to Curacao was scheduled for October 05 at 6.40am however on arriving at the checking counter I was told that the flight was delayed. After waiting for 4 hours I was then told the flight was cancelled. A taxi was offered to take me home and return the next day as the flight was now scheduled to depart at 5.30pm. Again on arriving at the checking counter I was told the flight was now delayed by 4 hours. The flight eventually left at 9.30 pm. Curacao is a very nice island but would not recommend to my friends to visit until there is a reliable option from Trinidad and Tobago.
Frankfurt to Los Angeles via Reykyavik. Its a pity that there is no option to give you zero stars because the flight conditions are fully unacceptable. You cannot perform 9 hour flight from Reykjavik to Los Angeles without offering your passengers even one cup of free water. Your name meets well to your passengers experience. What if the credit card is not working and I dont have cash with me I can understand that prices are sometimes cheaper than competitors but passengers have to be informed about this condition before the flight. It was my first and last flight with wow air.
Larnaca to Singapore via Dubai. Our flight from Cyprus got delayed more than an hour so we missed our connecting flight from Dubai to Singapore. As all other airlines do we thought that a group of flight attendants wold escort us to the new gate to catch the next flight we also informed the flight attendants in our flight from Cyprus to Dubai to do so and they ensured us that this was going to be done and nothing to worry about. We needed to reach Singapore the following morning as we had a very important meeting arranged at the airport. However coming out the aisle none called our names and none would answer our questions on how to reach the next gate. They would only tell us that we missed the next flight as well and that there is no chance of us arriving on time to the gate to get the next one. After a lot of drama with the useless connection manager we lost a lot of valuable time with result of missing the next flight as well. It was simply horrible. Never experienced worse service in my life not even with a budget airline. After arranging to stay in Dubai in order to have our meeting online we realized that we got an email from the airline that they rescheduled our seats for the following flight and we could have made it on time if we saw the email earlier and not listed to the negative outcome from the unhelpful manager. This is the second time this happened to my husband with this airline and we want to tell the travelers out there not to waste their valuable time and money well earned to throw it to them. Any other airline is much better
Their legroom is better than other low cost airlines and national flag companies. It is a breath of fresh air to fly on well managed airline. It is good to know one can count on them for the maintenance of competitive air fares on the routes they decide to operate.
Athens to Helsinki via Belgrade. Our company booked the trip trough Air Serbia website. I was travelling together with my boss and colleague who had return flights from Helsinki to Athens but I flew to Athens from Rome. We booked oneway ticket from Air Serbia website. After filling the payment information we got the Trip Confirmation to our email with Confirmation code. This was only email we received from Air Serbia. We printed out this document and showed it at the check in desk on 29.10.2019. They replied there is no such booking and the aircraft is overbooked. We did not understand what they meant by overbooked and why a confirmed flight did not exist. There was no help at the airport to sort the situation so we called Air Serbia. They repeated we have no such booking. For a reason or another this trip was cancelled and we never got a good answer for why. There was enough credit on the card the trip was confirmed from the company we had the necessary document from the confirmation but could not check in. I had to get back to Finland soonest possible and the airline did not do anything about this so my boss booked me a return ticket to the next available flight Air Turkey 72451 that is quite much for a trip that should cost around 100. Later at the airport I contacted Air Serbia again and now they replied that we can see the booking but maybe there has been some problem with Air Serbia website. They did not give any explanation about why this flight was cancelled Maybe because they had overbooked the plane and had to drop out someone I am stunned about how bad this airline handled this situation. The rest of the evaluation about the flight comes from my boss whose reservation was valid.
I had a business trip from Madrid to Riyadh on July 30 2022. My ticket was on Saudia. After 50 minutes from takeoff the plane landed in Valencia. The Captain informed us that there was a mild technical difficulty that would be fixed in an hour after which we would resume the flight. When we landed in Valencia the Captain and the crew left immediately without providing the passengers with any information. The only persons available were the ground service personnel in Valencia airport who informed us that they had no details and that the Saudia crew had left. The captain asked Valencia ground staff to let us know that the flight would depart from Madrid the next day August 31. So we had to find our way to Madrid. It was already 3 am when we got the information. The passengers and I were obliged to spend the night on the floor of Valencia airport with no food or water because all the facilities in the airport close at night. I booked a train ticket for 70 Euros from Valencia to Madrid at 730 am. When I arrived at the airport I was informed that the flight had been rescheduled for July 31 at 6 pm. I tried to check in at the counter at 2 pm but the agent told me there was no flight and she did not know when the flight would leave. After waiting four hours a message arrived that the flight had been rescheduled to August 1 at 6 pm. This means more than 48 hours of delay. This resulted in my inability to go to my business I had two bronchial asthma attacks and I paid a lot for transport. I called Saudia more than ten times and they never responded. I sent them complaint forms with no response.
Flew Solomon Airlines from Brisbane to Honiara. We boarded to be greeted by smiling attendants. The flight was not too full so we had 3 seats to ourselves. Leg room was quite good. IFE was just a screen panel lowered from the ceiling watched a movie. The meal was lunch we had the beef and it was delicious. Staff came around to check if we needed any more drinks throughout the flight.
This review is with respect to the second leg of my journey from Doha to Munich. Considering an international 3hr 20 mins flight Qatar Airways should have provided a better aircraft than the A320. The flight was packed with less seating space and difficulty in managing the cabin baggage. I had prebooked a vegetarian oriental meal the cottage cheese was quite hard and amount of rice was bare minimum.
Gatwick to Malaga. Nothing special nowadays theres unfortunately not much difference between BA Easyjet. Flight left Gatwick late arrived in Malaga late. BA seats no longer recline. Food and drinks are expensive their Cream Tea excludes tea. Lift your game BA your product just continues to get worse.
The service level of China Southern Airlines is still guaranteed. Compared with several wellknown lowcost airlines in China that provide lowcost services to reduce costs China Southern Airlines is more reassuring in terms of service level aviation safety and flight punctuality.
Flight departed 1 hour late from the original starting point hence the 1 hour layover at Kuwait was missed and hence I missed the connecting flight from Kuwait. Initially the staff didnt take any responsibility and only offered the same flight the next day and hotel accommodation but I had to reach COK urgently. After 3 hours of struggle talks and debates a manager turned up and people who didnt have to travel urgently were sent to a hotel and the rest of us were booked onto an alternative airline Oman in my case via Muscat which would get me to my destination 9 hours later than my original itenary had no choice
Cardiff to Palma. Had to pay extra 50 to sit next to relative which wasnt explained during booking. Flight delayed. Put on ASL Airline not TUI. Got diverted to Toulouse. TUI unable to get fuel there as no contract to do so. This led to further delay. All in all the experience was awful. I would not recommend TUI.
Hong Kong Airlines ground staff were pitiful. The woman that printed our boarding pass for the Hong Kong to Beijing flight was absolutely rude and talked to us like we were stupid. We were only asking questions about our baggage to make sure we dont lose them. She was not nice probably because it was 510 am. She was not able to provide a nice service information and good words to customers.
Flew Turkish Airlines from Miami to Istanbul. Positive things were the plane looked really nice every passenger has a screen in front of himher with a lot of movies the drinks are free. Negative things were there isnt enough space for your legs when you are 185 cm tall and the food was not good enough taste variety.
Kuwait to Amman via Dubai on 3rd July 2019. If you ever depart from Kuwait and are flying Emirates Id strongly suggest using online checkin. At KWI Emirates has a separate counter for online checkin passengers thus enabling passengers to skip the queue and proceed directly to the counter without having to wait. Be aware that during online checkin you will not receive eboarding passes if departing from Kuwait. I contacted Emirates and was told this is not an issue. At the counter I received the boarding passes for both flights EK 856 KWIDXB and my connecting flight EK 903 DXBAMM. The checkin experience was smooth and within 10 minutes I was through to immigration and security. Online checkin if departing from Kuwait is a lifesaver First leg EK 856 from Kuwait to Dubai on the B777300 ER. Boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. It was chaotic as expected for a fullybooked flight. Unfortunately the aircraft was really old registration A6EBE. The screen was very small and ICE version was also very old. 343 configuration is not a favorite and the seats felt narrow. Only 1 meal choice and no menus were given. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Kuwait due to late completion of boarding. Luckily arrival in Dubai was only 5 minutes late despite the 30 minute delay departing Kuwait. If possible book a seat on the left or right side of the aircraft rows A B C or H J K. These seats will feel less cramped than seats in the middle rows D E F G. I was seated in seat 33A. Overall a good flight although Id avoid the EK B777 economy product alltogether unfortunately EK doesnt fly the A380 to Kuwait so thats not possible. Second leg EK 903 from Dubai to Amman on the A380800. First time flying the EK A380 Again boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. The aircraft was definitely newer registration A6EOU. ICE version was newer and screen was much bigger. Still a 343 configuration however much more comfortable than the 777. Just like the previous flight no menus were given and there was only 1 meal choice. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Dubai and arrival in Amman was only 3 minutes late. I was seated in seat 78K. Baggage claim at AMM was abysmal I wonder if the problem lies with Emirates or the baggage handling system at AMM. I cant really give them much blame due to the fact that the aircraft was an A380 but waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for baggage delivery is still unacceptable Also in my opinion Emirates should really rethink boarding times. Boarding an aircraft 45 minutes prior to scheduled departure time surely guarantees a delay. On EK 856 pushback was not until 15 minutes after scheduled departure time and on EK 903 pushback was not until 13 minutes after scheduled departure time In my opinion boarding should begin 60 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. Also Emirates should grant its aircraft a 2hour turnaround time slot. This would give 1 hour to clean and prep the aircraft for boarding and an additional hour to complete boarding ensuring an ontime departure.
We travelled on Singapore Airlines many years ago in economy class. We travelled this time in business class because of the long flight. The service provided on the latest trip was very good however we did pre order some food that disappointingly did not arrive but the flight menu options were good. The biggest problem we had was the seating arrangements in business class the seats were hard and uncomfortable. A weird cover was provided to increase comfort. The problem was no calf support and any way shape or form this has a big impact on leg comfort. There was a flap thing that came out but onlyto the back of the knee which was so useless. The second problem was there was no tunnel to slide into for a flat sleeping position. Instead of the tunnel there was a shelf that had to be pulled out but this was to the side of the seat. Instead of laying flat which we were supposed to achieve the side shelf meant sleeping at an angle which was so uncomfortable. I do not understand why Singapore Airlines would ever believe that their seating arrangements would provide comfort. Cost is huge for these additional benefits for both comfort and health as older people travelling. The outcome is of course we wont be travelling business class with Singapore Airlines again which is really sad.
My son and his girlfriend flew July 22nd. They had a layover in Charlotte NC. Well my sons girlfriend needs a wheelchair which the airline left in North Carolina. I know this happens. My complaint is if it does with Frontier there is no customer service phone number. I had to file a complaint it could take them 7 days to respond. They arent responsible for lost items well they lost it. Also their baggage fees are outrageous. They advertise cheap well they arent. I and none of my family will ever fly Frontier again.
Toronto to London Heathrow and was very pleasantly surprised. BA Lounge in terminal 3 at Pearson is small but quiet compared to others. Great window seats overlooking tarmac. Separate meal service area prior to flight allowed me to focus on sleep during this redeye that left at 2200. Meal in lounge was buffet style but had a really good made to order noodle bar. Drink choices perfectly adequate. Staff very helpful and cordial. Flight left half an hour late but made up time and landed early. Cabin staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The seats must be the most talked about issue for BA club world. They do indeed pack them in compared to any other business class flight I have taken. That said seats fully reclined I had no issues with faulty equipment and it was very comfortable. Aside from takeoff and morning meal service privacy screen never came down between me and fellow traveler. Cost of flight was 3050 less than other business class options available to me so with this in mind experience was very good. As a side note connected on to Madrid and BA lounges at LHR are fantastic. W
London LHR to Milan LIN. Boarding was quick and efficient flight departed on time and cabin crew were very friendly. The aircraft was clean seats were comfortable and the price was excellent. I strongly recommend Alitalia.
We were booked to take 4 flights on Yangon in June. A little concerned when we fronted the quaint little desk in Yangon to find it unattended but were assured that there are helpers at all Myanmar airports who take your bag to the desk and deal with it. The next 3 flights on Yangon were good. Planes were all prop aircraft seating about 70. I think we were on the same plane every time. Seats are not allocated which worried us at first but it was not an issue. The sticker to identify patrons in the departure lounge are a cute touch. Nice little snack and drink no matter how short the flight. Staff were friendly and helpful.
Wonderful experience with Singapore Airlines. Once entering aircraft was greeted by friendly cabin crew who showed me to my seat came around and gave me headphones and eye shades. With my status I was given a whole row to myself and the crew gave me businessclass quality hot towel and headphones. The aircraft being 15 days old at the time of flying had a fast touchscreen monitor. The toilets were stocked with free amenities including toothbrush and toothpaste. Crew took my order first food choices sweet and sour pork or steamed fish. I chose the pork was so delicious. Delicious Turkish pide couscous salad and bread roll. I was also given an activity pack although really not for my age still a nice touch which featured a deck of cards and some crayons. KrisWorld lounge was a bit crowded even at midnight with a stream of people waiting to connect. The seat was plush and featured adjustable headrest footrest and much more. Probably my favourite are the little storage pockets you will find under the seat one is shaped perfectly for your passport and phone and the other for your boarding pass and immigration cards. However the WiFi is very overpriced cannot believe that they are charging 20 for some 100MB of data Scoot is cheaper at 18. Would also have liked to see some more new and blockbuster movies on the iFE was a bit disappointed.
Porter Airlines is quite unreliable I had my flight cancelled twice and was rebooked for a flight 6 days after the original. However the customer service was amazing and my flight was brought forward by the amazing Shasha. She worked really hard to find a way to get me to my destination despite booked up flights and was the most efficient kind and friendly airline customer server I have ever spoken to. Thank you Shasha for brightening up my day and being such a life saver
Barcelona to Boston via London. Mixed review we had to rebook suddenly for nextday business class because my wife broke a bone in her shoulder and had to go home urgently. BA cut us no slack for the injury and the change cost a fortune. The good flight crews were wonderfully supportive and helpful food was surprisingly good wheelchair attendants at LHR were wonderful. The bad A321 business class was an economy seat with slightly increased pitch and the middle seat blocked Boeing 777 business class seats were very comfortable but a seat in the middle of the 4seat central block allowed no access to the aisle if the aisle passenger had the seat flattened or was using the footrest LHR connection of 2 hr was barely enough for terminal 3 to 5 transfer BA representative said 1 hr would be adequate even with a wheelchair that allowed priority through security and transfer bus. Also a nasty surprise no wifi on a 7hr transatlantic flight.
London City to Manchester. After reading other passengers comments I was expecting a great service. This is far from what I received. My original flight was cancelled with no reason or explanation given they managed to swap me to another flight but that was running late. My colleagues on the 720 flight didnt take off until 1030. Upon boarding the fokker 50 the cabin crew just one person may just have been wearing a sign saying Im having a bad day the attitude was absolutely terrible. It would be unfair to name this person but she did not smile once during the flight and was stern and just so unfriendly. There were no pre take off sweets. I do not understand how anyone can say VLMs food is good you get offered half a brown sandwich in a plastic wrapper or fruit not even both and no plate. Certainly no chocolates as others have mentioned. On a positive I had a problem with my eticket for my return trip and the lady at the VLM ticket office at Manchester airport was helpful friendly and smiled Shame she isnt working as cabin crew
Johannesburg to George. I had a very bad experience with flysafair both times Ive make use of them and this is my first bad review of any service or place. After booking online for a extra check in suitcase they denied it and make me pay again further the staff at boarding in Johannesburg shouts at us. In George on 3 seats with a window seat only to be called back to exchange tickets for seats across the passage now I sit with a crying daughter who made herself ready for a window seat so I would rather next time use a more organized airline.
London City to Luxembourg. Absolute shambolic excuse for customer service. I boarded a flight from London City airport to Luxembourg on 080422. I paid for the luggage to be transferred. When I arrived in Luxembourg to my surprise my luggage had not. I informed luggage assistance at the airport and we logged the report but the information provided was nonexistent log your details and well get back to you when we hear something. I called Luxair a few hours later with my reference and was informed that my luggage would be on the 6pm flight and someone would contact me. At 7.15pm I received a call from the rudest socalled customer service I have had the displeasure to encounter. He asked me whether I would like my luggage delivered I which I agreed when I stated the postcode he refused. He said no you better come and collect it if you need it. My argument is that I paid for a service that was not delivered. At this he hung up on me. If this is the type of customer service training you provide your staff it needs to be reviewed. My weekend in Germany with my partners family is being interrupted as I now need to drive to Luxembourg to pick up my luggage for a mistake you made.
Id always avoided Ryanair but succumbed to a good deal. It turns out that you do get what you pay for. An hour sitting on the runway eachway no explanation queuing waiting arguments for passengers with bags bigger than allowed and a who cares attitude throughout. Just a really negative vibe.
Unpleasant ground staff at Deauville Airport believe that it is forbidden to fly if you do not have your own completed name and address tag on your suitcase. Even after pointing out to them that the baggage checkin tag contains your name and destination they insisted on a separate baggage tag as the luggage might get lost. I did mention to them that as it was the only commercial flight of the day that I would be rather surprised if they lost it All the time the baggage handler who looked about fourteen was shouting the one English word that he knew at me name.
Marrakesh to Fez. The domestic check in was handled by Swissport and was efficient. The security screening took about 30 mins. The departures lounge was relatively compact and seating was limited. We were bussed out to the aircraft an A320. The flight took off about 10 mins behind schedule As it was overcast there was limited views of the Morroco on the 50 min journey to Fez. The crew were friendly efficient and were quick to serve passengers that had prepurchased food and beverages on the short flight. Air Arabia is a dry airline and no alcoholic beverages are sold on board. We arrived into Fez on schedule. Despite being a domestic flight were were required to pass through immigration who required both the boarding pass and passport. We waited for about 20 mins for our bags to be delivered.
Gatwick to Las Vegas. Boarding by group number seemed to work well at Gatwick we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about 45 min after take off. The crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team. BA have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best Ive ever had on a long haul flight. The aircraft was old and dated and the IFE was a throwback to the 90s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to HD quality these days. All in all a very enjoyable flight.
Ground staff was helpful. The flight itself was uneventful. Cabin staff was nice and helpful as usual. This was an onehour flight so no food service but each passenger got a bottle of water not bad at all. There is no IFE which was not a problem. However for a 4star fullservice airline this is underwhelming as the aircraft can be used for longer routes.
Paid for a priority ticket travelling with my partner the checkin staff didnt even look to the priority lane to motion us forward we had to almost barge forward. The staff member took offence until I Said to her that we were waiting in the above said queue. Boarding was late no fault of the airline or crew. Here is where it gets interesting. As soon as we boarded I needed to go to the toilet as the terminal toilet was out of order. I asked as soon as I sat down and was told the front toilet was out of order and was told to wait until we are in the air to use the toilet at the back. Shortly after take off I saw a cabin crew member use the so called out of order toilet. To add Insult to injury the seatbelt sign was kept on way after we had levelled off. The crew were up preparing for food and drink service. As they were about to wheel the food trolley down just in front of me I asked them now a third time that I urgently needed to use the toilet. Their reply was after the meal service. I said this is the third time asking and you are doing meal service with the seatbelt sign still on. This is obviously a strategy concocted by the crew to do uninterrupted service whilst denying paying passengers the right to use the lavatories. One crew member was forcefully telling me to wait till the sign was off. Now if there was up coming turbulence then the meal and drink service would be suspended and the seatbelt sign would come on. But to use this strategy as trick to do their little bit of work and then chat in the galley with the curtain drawn is just unacceptable. Holding your passengers captive to satisfy efficiency comes from a poor work culture and in my book is pure laziness. To keep the the front lavatory solely for staff use is unacceptable.
Dubai to Bangkok. Used to be a very frequent flier on Emirates but standards have deteriorated more and more. This flight was probably my last one for me with that airline. Very nice plane but extremely mediocre service. Staff mostly seemed more interested in enjoying themselves in the back of the plane than to look after passengers. Food was also rather uninteresting staff forgot to offer any drinks with the meal very impersonal service. Not that flight was full.
Seoul to Los Angeles. This is my 9th time flying business class with Asiana Airlines. But during this last flight I didnt feel like I flown a business class seat. Only 2 washrooms were available for business class passengers which were small the 3rd washroom was for FA staff use only The meal service was very slow. Dinner service took them almost 2 hours to finish due to the fact they only had 2 FAs for the whole business class section 20 passengers the FA forgot my wine a spoon a couple of times. The crew manager went around but didnt actually introduce himself and thanked the passengers one by one. They saw me awake during the flight when they were making rounds but didnt bother asking if I wanted a snack or anything. The amenity kit has changed and it looked really cheap
Lusaka to Cape Town via Windhoek. I booked this ticket on line about 4 weeks before the departure date. I had to phone the Air Namibia call center after booking as I received a confirmation email but not the eticket. The night before the departure around 2000 I received a call from Air Namibia informing me the flight had been cancelled due to an operational issue most likely not enough booked passengers I was given the option of being rebooked on any of the daily flights on South African Airways to Johannesburg and then Air Namibia to Windhoek. I chose the 1325 flight and was told to pop into their office at the airport to collect my new ticket as it would be waiting for me. Unfortunately it wasnt and it took three hours of sitting around and a final mad rush to board ever walked onto a plane where everyone has been sitting waiting to see what idiot has held up the flight Anyway to cut it short a journey that should have been 4 hours check in and flight time ended up being 11 hours. Air Namibia not a care in the world.
We purchased our package in March of 2022 scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022 they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldnt upgrade me or give me my money back. I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However coming back was the same they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November. I send email after email call after call and no help.
Istanbul to Dammam with Turkish Airlines. We entered Istanbul airport and the staff were so kind the checkin staff had a big smile on their faces and the checkin process was quick. When we entered the plane we were welcomed by the staff and they were very polite the seat is comfortable for a mediumhaul flight and the IFE has a great selection of music and movies. The breakfast was alright not the best the only problem is that the IFE kept kicking me out of my movie every 10 minutes. When we landed the staff said goodbye to us and our baggage arrived safely.
Had a bad preflight experience with the airline I had accidentally booked 15 kgs of extra Luggage instead of 10 KG. I contacted Vistara customer care to reduce my extra Luggage to 10 KG and refund the rest as airline points so as that I can use it in my return flight to Delhi after a month. I offered to make an additional 10kg purchase of luggage along with this carryover 5KG right away but they refused to help me out. These requests were made 6 hrs prior to my first flight here from Auckland.
This is such a convenient flight from Chiang Mai to Hua Hin as it eliminates the 3.5hour transfer from Bangkok to Hua Hin or 3hour transfer to Cha Am. Pity its only 23 times a week usually on Wednesdays and Sundays. The aircraft staff and service are what you would expect from any AirAsia flight. Efficient and costeffective. No frills to the extreme but worth every penny.
Bad experience bought a tickets from the internet and paid more 100 for a check in. Dont fly with wizzair. Very bad company its only feels cheap and at the end you are paying more than normal flights
Not happy. Have just paid 75 for excess baggage. I believe the costs are too high in comparison to BA and many other credible airline companies. Croatia Airlines failed to offer a possibility of paying excess baggage online and reduce the costs did not offer a possibility of upgrading into a higher flying class to avoid the charges. Additionally they do not offer online check in and they could only issue me two boarding passes while I have to get the last one in Vienna to London even though theyre aware that there is a very limited amount of time between the two fights. Ill do my best to avoid Croatia Airlines in future.
San DiegoLHRMAN. On 6th January we flew from San Diego to Manchester UK via Heathrow. After flying out on Christmas Day via LAX on the A380 this flight was a welcome return to form for BAs Club World offering. The San Diego Admirals Club lounge is currently undergoing refurbishment but is still a nice space and unlike the UK lounges upon arrival we were offered a menu not just a self serve buffet. When it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the A380 the staff at San Diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft glass of bubbly in hand in minutes. The cabin crew were much friendlier and professional than those on the outward flight as this is smaller cabin with fewer passengers you definitely felt that you were the premium customer your ticket price would suggest and nothing was too much trouble. Drinks were constantly topped up food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. The entertainment system might not have been quite as impressive as on the A380 but considering we slept for a large portion of this 10 hour flight that was unimportant. After a very average outward flight on the A380 into LA this superb flight home on the smaller aircraft restored my faith in BAs club offering and means that for future trips to the West Coast we will be flying direct into San Diego rather than LAX.
Check in at Tegel was a disaster and ludicrously for it has a lot of BA flights I was told there are no BA staff at that airport to sort out problems. 100 minutes prior to departure 2 check in desks were open 1 business 1 economy. As a BA Silver card holder I joined the business queue. First one lady had considerably too much baggage. The arguments went on for more than 10 minutes before she paid the extra fees. Then the technical crew for a pop event the previous day had to be checked in. Not only were some of their 20 or so items very overweight others were way too large. After 20 more minutes I asked a young lady why the other business passengers could not be processed at the economy desk. This was not possible I was told. Eventually another economy desk opened yet our queue remained immobile for a further 15 minutes. Finally after more than 40 minutes someone decided we could be processed at an economy desk after all Looking forward to a drink in the lounge I then discover there is no lounge airside. As for the LHRORD flight I have been spoiled with business class intercontinental travel since business class was introduced. To board an international carrier and discover a seat pitch of just 31 was a major shock. This is like travelling long haul on a budget carrier only at considerably greater cost. The worst part was the cabin was kept at an extremely warm temperature throughout despite requests for the captain to reduce it to a more reasonable level. The meal was OK and the IFE had a decent selection of movies. But overall the flight was hugely uncomfortable. With some other carriers still offering a seat pitch greater than 31 BA has lost my future business.
Terrible food didnt schedule buses for gate to aircraft transfer both directions of travel. Poor planning. Loaded commercial cargo last minute causing over 55 minute push off delay. Are passengers really worth this little
I couldnt check in online during both my flights to Cancun and back to Toronto. I tried multiple times from multiple browsers and systems but online checkin did not work. As a result they did not provide my family 2 seats to sit together both ways They couldnt get me any accommodation or changes on their flight seats inspite of checking in 3 hours earlier. I will not recommend this flight to even family of 2. And you will have to buy your seats extra than buying flight tickets.
Traveled from Miami to Port of Spain on a Boeing 737800. Check in was smooth and quick. Purchased a Caribbean Plus seat 9C. As a member of Caribbean Airlines club check in process is via the business class counter. I proceeded to the LATAM club. This club was very clean and offered light snacks free wifi charging ports for electronic devices. After I proceeded to the gate for boarding. Boarding process was very easy as Club members board after business class passengers. Upon arrival into the aircraft I was personally greeted by the purser. He checked my boarding pass and directed me to my seat. My seat was very comfortable and very spacious. I highly recommend purchasing a Caribbean Plus seat. The advertised seat pitch is 37 inches and seat recline was great. The meal service was excellent and comprised of chicken breast noodles and vegetables. The meal was delicious. The flight attendants were very friendly and professional. The flight left five minutes early and arrived into Trinidad 25 minutes early. The landing was the smoothest landing ever. The captain and his first officer were outstanding.This is a small airline with great qualities and I hope it continues.
I am in Australia and on Friday night went online to book a flight from Heathrow to Malpensa Milan. I did not realise that when I specifically searched for flights to Malpensa it offered options to other airports in Milan. When I received my itinerary by email it was to another airport in Milan. The itinerary email did not provide any means of contact for changes or advise me of the 24 hour cooling off period. As it was the weekend here I was unable to reach their office until Monday when they advised me there was no refund other than fees as I had missed the 24 hour cooling off period. Apparently as the ticket was issued in the UK I needed to contact them. I have now cancelled the ticket and I will be going out of my way in the future to avoid flying British Airways.
My family and friends 6 persons bought on 1342022 tickets to Vienna for Christmas 2022. We received confirmation from Austrian Airlines for Flight Athens Vienna on 25122022 at 1455 Flight Vienna Athens on 31122022 at 2205 On 23122022 I tried to checkin online for the first flight but I received a reply from the system mentioning that it was not possible to complete the checkin and that I should make it at the airport when I will arrive to board to the flight. I called the Customer Serviceto understand if there is something wrong with the system and I discovered that Austrian Airlines cancelled both our flights without notice to us. I asked for a solution for the situation caused by Austrian Airlines and they informed me that they could Book seats in an earlier flight 2512 at 1325 instead of 1455 Book seats in another return flight on 01012023 at 1825 instead of 3112 at 2205 I accepted and booked these tickets upon receiving an assurance from the Customer Service that they will pay for the additional cost that will arise due to the change of our departure date. I asked if there is any restriction prerequisite for the expenses and they replied that they do not have any restriction as long as we do not book a five star Hotel. After our trip we sent the invoices of the expenses to Austrian Airlines and after a two months dialogue they denied to pay our expenses and furthermore they denied to pay compensation. Fortunately we discovered APF Agency for Passenger Rights and with their efforts Austrian Airlines was convinced for their mistakes and payed full compensation according to the EU directive but about 65 of our expenses because as they claim they have restrictions. At the end we accepted the 65 because after five months of continuous efforts with the airline we could not stand it any longer.
Denpasar to Sydney. There is a big difference with Garuda depending on the configuration of the aircraft. Unfortunately this flight was the old configuration and was not a true lie flat bed. The IFE on Garuda is never great but this was as poor. Garuda also seem to struggle in Business Class when the flight is full. I have to say that the service on this flight could have been much better. On boarding there was no introduction by the FA we then had to wait for an hour to get a glass of wine off the crew and this was not replenished without asking. As it was a late flight there was not dinner service and the breakfast. was tasty but service was haphazard. Overall not the best experience in Business Class.
Generally Im full of praise for this airline but a number of tech faults on the Saab 2000s recently including right now as Im stranded at Leeds Bradford has slightly shaken my belief in this company. Poor communications apparently reducing reliability lack of punctuality no staff available at LBA etc etc what should be a fast twiceweekly commute has become very hit and miss. Most distressing was calling Eastern two weeks ago knowing that LBA was closed due to snow only to be told that their flight was departing on time Not clever. I didnt even bother to go to the airport preferring instead a 5hr drive. Theyve got to try harder to keep business customers like me on planes that are generally lightly loaded we are the only ones providing regular revenue. Feeling unloved currently.
The flight attendants were amazing. One in particular Jessie sorry if I spelled that incorrectly went above and beyond. She addressed any concerns passengers had. My friend and I were concerned we wouldnt be able to eat so she gave us some of her snacks because she didnt need them. Those who were worried about connecting flights she assisted right away. Will definitely fly with Air Canada again.
I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a lowcost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes economy premium business first but each of those classes is split into 4 types special saver flex flexplus. The saver fares usually look too good to be true because they are If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate fare differences. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class they will tell you that your fare type is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. Even if the flight youre on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty something you think the airline would be glad of they still try to gauge you. If youre lucky enough to get through to customer service they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of 100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. As soon as I got back to my hotel room I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later there was suddenly a fare difference to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to. Eventually I was put through to another man a second level supervisor or officer
They force to check in small cabin luggage although you have a tight connection after and might miss your train. KLM used to be one of my favourites airlines unfortunately the service quality dropped off dramatically last years. I can give an example from today. Firstly I could not check in online because of the flight was overbooked. Therefore I had to arrived earlier to the airport to the check in counter although I didnt have any check in luggage. The line was very long and it was already a bit stressful to wait there. Secondly they FORCED me to check in my small cabin luggage that I had with me although I EXPLAINED MANY TIMES that I have a train to catch and additional waiting for a luggage after arrival will almost surely end up missing my connection. I understand that there sometimes there is no place for all luggages on board but they should not force passengers with very valid reason for not doing it. As I supposed before after landing I waited for a luggage for 25min and missed my train connection. Im cursing at KLM service. Thanks for many flights but not recommended anymore.
Have flown Amsterdam to Dubai roundtrips with Emirates A380s since they started the route. Seat IFE and overall cabin comfort remain top in class. Catering has recently improved quality of the FAs is still erratic but Emirates find it increasingly difficult to depart on time both in AMS and DXB. When departure is delayed by more than 45min it is not possible to catchup during the flight as the sector is not long enough. Turnaround time in Amsterdam is very short and thus departure time suffers quickly when the inbound flight is delayed. Not sure why leaving Dubai on time is so difficult but according to announcements made by cabin staff it is often due to passengers arriving late at the gate.
GCISOU. Very good value. Everything included in the headline price no extras. Nice little lounge at Guernsey for free drinks and biscuits. Dornier 328 very comfortable aircraft.
What a disgrace this sad little airline has become. I fly regularly between Amsterdam and Malta several times a year and unfortunately Air Malta is the only direct option. Air Maltas aircraft are old shabby and dirty and the leg room is pathetic Because their economy product is so abysmal I recently decided to travel business class what a joke Firstly their is no business class check in lane at Amsterdam airport so this means queueing with everyone else. After waiting for over 30 minutes I finally arrived at the business class check in counter. Why have a check in counter for business class but no separate check in lane When I enquired about this I was met with a shrug and giggles pathetic. Once onboard the seat 1A was filthy and the window covered in fingerprints and was so badly scratched I could barely see out of it. There was also rubbish stuffed between the seats. Amazingly to me there was no separation between economy and business not even a curtain. This meant that the front toilet which is normally reserved for business class was open to everyone. For pretty much the whole flight there was a queue of passengers in the aisle. I paid over 1000 for my ticket and am absolutely shocked that this is what Air MALTA try to pass off as business class. For shame what an absolute disgrace. This airline is an insult to the beautiful country of Malta and its good people.
I have flown many times with this airline. They never left on time. We are sitting in Las Vegas on a plane and have been sitting for 40 minutes outside at 120 degrees. Im late for a business dinner.
Despite the fact that we were there as per the 90 minutes expectation and there was no end to the queues in sight we were told that we cannot board the flight 10 minutes prior to its departure. Flysafair took no responsibility whatsoever for the long queue and we were sent from pillar to post trying to find assistance with almost none of their employees being able to give us the answers we need. Had they been competent and knowledgeable we may have been able to board the flight in time but instead wasted so much money. Thats exactly what they want it seems. We were told that we could be on the wait list for a non refundable R300 and couldnt even tell us how many people are on the list already. Paid the fee and it turned out that more than 13 were already on the wait list so not only does that just show how many people werent able to make it in time but also how they get you to pay because you hope that you may be next on the wait list. Im really disappointed in this type of service in this age
We were not able to check in online for our British Airways flight from Bangkok to London. Boarding was a shambles with no clear boarding of business class first. I was travelling with my partner and we were not initially seated together. Seating together was only confirmed at the time of boarding. It is unacceptable to have to pay for a seat. Food selection and quality was poor. Chicken Tikka dry and the appearance a murky brown colour except the rice. Meal was starchy with both rice and potatoes. Overall cheap They had run out of our choice for the next meal by the time they reached us. Again the selection very limited. Meal very cheap and unappetising and left almost uneaten. Offered only one drink tea coffee water with no refill offered. Staff service very mediocre at best. I could not charge my computer on either the outbound or return flights.
PenangLangkawi on ATR Flight was on time crew worked excellent together and the flight attendants were cheerfully serving orange juice and water during this 20 minute flight. A very good experience.
Wish I had read the comments on here before booking with El Al. This was hands down the worst experience I have had on any airline ever. It is virtually impossible to speak to anyone on the phone at El Al. Online booking system was relatively straight forward and even booked and paid for exit row seats. Flight departure time changed one week out from departure. Exit row seats not honoured at online checkin. Blatantly lied to at check in with assurances that we had just been moved to different exit row seats the new seats were not exit row seats. Delayed or deliberately withheld my bag from the flight and only delivered the bag 2 days later. Impossible to contact anyone from El Al and the WhatsApp option is just a joke. Food terrible service terrible and toilets disgusting. Thankfully it was only 3 hours of hell. There is not much to like about this airline. Flight times on this route are also elongated by about 30 min as compared to nonIsraeli airlines due to geopolitical concerns for Israeli flagged carriers.
Boston to Ponta Delgada with SATA Air Azores. I was very disappointed with this airline the seats were extremely small and I am only 54 so I can imagine how bad it was for taller people. The flight to Ponta Delgada is an overnight flight but the lights kept coming on and off the whole flight. They served a meal a few hours into the flight but it smelt so bad and I was woken up from sleeping that I didnt try any. The food on the way back to Boston was edible though. We left Boston almost 45 minutes late as well. We also flew from Ponta Delgada to Santa Maria for a few days and that 15 minute flight each way was on time and fine. When we left Ponta Delgada to return to Boston the flight was an hour late leaving making me miss my flight back home to Phoenix. They spent the time busing us all from the gate to the plane even though they made us walk the distance when we first arrived and that process was slow and unorganized. I have never seen such a disorganized airline even in Boston they dont have lanes to line up in so everyone crowds the doorway making it impossible for the people who are supposed to be boarding to board. This happened on all flights very disorganized and no semblance of order for the passengers. The video and entertainment systems did not work on any of the flights either. I really hope to return to the Azores Islands as they were beautiful but I really hope there are better and more choices for flights the next time I go.
Again Avior and disapointed but its the only carrier operating between Trinidad W.I. and Isla Margarita. They recently cancelled the operation of the old B732 except public Holidays and long weekends in Trinidad into a small 19 seater Turboprop Beech Aircraft. No washroom on this Aircraft and no FAs. The only safety instruction was a lousy tape in Spanish. Only English speaking Trinis on board. Return flight we were told that the flight is delayed from 9am to 12noon maybe because of technical problems in Barcelona Venezuela. Actually the flight came in 2PM and after again 2 hrs we were able to board the flight. The ground staff from Avior was helpful and organized for other passenger to get baggage in the terminal to feed small children and change clothes. We arrived safe back in Trinidad but still worries about the standard and safety of this airline.
Madrid to Nice. Checkin at Terminal 4 Madrid airport was fairly easy where there are many self service kiosks available. After obtaining a boarding pass from the self service kiosk I had to drop my checkin baggage at designated counters a short walk away. A staff member checked to ensure that the baggage tag is tagged on correctly before accepting the baggage. The boarding gate was a good 2025mins walk away. Boarding was orderly. The flight was over 90 full and overhead cabin space was quite limited. Seats in economy cannot recline but it was not a problem. There is no inflight entertainment. Each seat comes with a charging point located below the seat so it takes a bit of a search to be able to locate it.
Check in was efficient and fast. The Business Cabin was full. There were drinks at the pre takeoff stage. Flight was a little late boarding and taking off. The flight was comfortable and the food service adequate. There was no IFE on a six hour flight. Leg room and recline was adequate and given the length of the flight could have been better. Level of service was only adequate and airline on this experience barely justifies its three star rating. S7 Siberia Airlines recommended only for the value for a direct flight from Bangkok to Irkutsk.
Kahului Airport. I was traveling with two kids and an infant. We got our bag tagged and only seen my infants paper ticket. Upon checking in my bag and my daughters car seat the lady who assisted us kept yelling at me for a good 6 mins bc I didnt see my ticket printed and it dropped on the ground. I was about to show her my eticket and she did not even bother and told me she didnt need that and she demanded the paper ticket. She literally kept yelling at me trying to explain how she needed the ticket in order for her to scan. She told me to go back to the self service to check if I dropped my ticket in which she could have just easily printed it herself because she had already verified my ID. I went back and grabbed my ticket from the floor and gave it to her. She then told me she didnt need it because she will print a new set of tickets. Such a bad customer service rude and disrespectful AF. She shouldnt be in a customer service industry with that rude attitude of hers.
Riga to Reykjavik. A truly awful experience. We traveled from United States to London and then took airBaltic from London to Riga. No problems. Baggage was accepted. On the return flight from Riga to Iceland we were required to pay 120 euros because our carry on bags were 1kg over the weight limit. Yes 1 kg. We told the attendant that it was the same luggage and weight on the way over and we didnt have a penalty. She demanded payment in a very loud and militant voice that we must pay 120 euros. She was awful. Militant is the only word I could use to describe her very rude behavior. Take a different airline is my advice.
Hong Kong to Bangkok. An 8pm flight is reschedule to 8.20pm notification via email. Queue opened at 7.50pm but boarding has not started until 8.17pm. When asked of announcement at 8.10pm the staffs indifferently replied they have not received any confirmation by the pilot. After advising they should do something to manage to the expectation of the queues full of passengers they declined and repeated the same thing and challenged to write a complaint. So this corresponds to their request. Entering the cabin the inflight manager could not answer the approximate arrival time needed to repeat the same question and insisted the answer before takeoff for communication reasons. Otherwise I wouldnt think the Cathay staffs are care enough of their ontime performance. A couple of apologies only follows after all the repeated requests and questions. Cabin service ok but it is offset with the inefficient lack communication and reckless ground staff.
Sriwijaya Air have quite good value of money for this flight from Silangit to Jakarta. There are other airlines with better amenities flying the same route but Sriwijaya is one of the few who is doing the direct flight. The worst gripe is that some of the flight attendants are really not professional. The flight attendants generally is bugging the passengers to buy from the inflight shop which costs lots of money. One of them even sit beside the passenger to ask the passenger to buy the item. While the passenger is also on fault for not rejecting this behavior the actions of the FAs are not professional at all. The food is not good. The seats are pretty standard in Indonesia. The ground staff at DTB is quite nice and quite quick in checking us in.
Amsterdam to Ohrid. This company was a joke before I even got off the ground. I booked a flighthotel deal from Amsterdam to Lake Ohrid Macedonia. I have been there several times before and wanted to go to Albania. I booked a more expensive day Friday versus a Saturday and paid single supplement because frankly there was no possible way to get back to my home from Schiphol at 4 AM. I realize its a charter and know the game but they kept changing the return departure time with no notice I only accidentally noticed when I was booking a seat and they eventually settled on the same timedate as it would have been if I had booked the Saturday flight. No notice no refund and really no class. I called them and they said they were really unsure when the return flight would be. I decided to cut my losses at this totally defunct way of doing business and fear of what would happen to me if I actually went to Macedonia with them. Lesson learned at 40 penalty and hope I can help you avoid this airline as well.
After reading lots of reviews I was really sceptical about flying with WOW air. I still went ahead and booked my ticket to detroit as it was the cheapest option for a one way and I had to book last minute which is always more expensive I decided to pay for selected seats up the front with extra leg room on both flights and got really lucky with having no one in my row for the first flight. The second flight I chose a seat with no middle seat and was really happy with this decision. As its a cheap airline a lot of people do not pay for the seat upgrade its really not expensive to purchase the extra leg room and well worth it for the comfort Plus you will likely not have many people around. The food and drink on board is very expensive but as I knew this beforehand I purchased food and water at the airport to take on the flight with me. I think I was lucky with the reliability of both my flights taking off on time as this was the one thing I was worried about The seats are very dirty front seat pocket but all airlines are usually quite unhygienic so this was to be expected. The service on board I thought was great very friendly staff and attentive. Overall I would say you get what you pay for and you are taking a risk booking with WOW air but lucky for me I had a good experience with them and would book again
Id rather not go on the trip than fly with Air Canada. I was stuck for over 24 hours at the airport with no food or drink or idea of how Id get home. The flight was delayed 100 on them and the manager said he ran out of everything and wed have to sleep on the floor until someone can rebook our tickets. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Waited in line for over 5 hours. Had to scream in order for a answer to sleep on the floor. Worst experience ever still trying to get in contact with them to receive a refund and compensation. No help at all. Customer service line has to high of call volume and hangs up on you.
Ive always flown with them and theyre nice for short haul flight. Welcome on board with a bottle and after that given a small sandwich compare to other airlines which will even make you pay for it. Sometimes they do have delays but which airlines doesnt For the price your paying I think its worth it Ive always picked them in front of other companies.
LCYAMS on KLAF codeshare. A 146 and though seen a few miles was smart and comfortable albeit a bit noisy. Left and arrived on time. Crew very good and got refreshments out quickly on this short mid morning flight. Soft cheese roll and a coffee just fine for the 50 minutes at cruise. With well manned immigration at SPL and my bag appearing on the carousel as I reached it a good service as advertisedrefreshing.
Manchester to Palma. Arrived 3 hours before our morning flight from Manchester to Palma. Done everything we were asked to do had our printed boarding cards so all that was left was to drop off our luggage. When we arrived at terminal 2 we were greeted by a queue almost the full length of the terminal which we were told to join. After about 30 minutes we got to the zig zag line so thought that we would soon be through only to find that the queue extended down the tunnel towards terminal 3 for some 200 metres doubled back then you got to the zig zag queue. After almost 3 hours with our flight time approaching we got to the root of the problem. Only 3 tui staff supervising travellers to check in their luggage using the installed self serve machines. We managed to check most of our luggage in but the machine wouldnt accept one of them. We asked for assistance 3 times and waited but got no assistance for over half an hour. We then had the security checks to contend with which is another story. We eventually made the flight but only because all TUI flights had to be delayed due to the farce at the bag drop. Never again
Prague to London. A two hour flight on 27th July was delayed by 3 hours with no heads up given by BA. There was no sympathy or compensation especially as our original flight was early morning and with an email informing us of the delay we could have stayed longer in the hotel.
My brother and I had flown from Charlotte to Dulles and originally had seats towards the back of the plane. I am 66 and my brother is 64 with a prosthetic leg. Our flight attendant watched us struggle to get to our seats and cram ourselves in for the flight. He walked back and invited us to come sit in first class in 2 open seats and proceeded to make it one of the most enjoyable flights we had been on with outstanding service. We will be back to American in the future
Manila to Taiwan return they issue a travel ban on February 10 so were not able to use the ticket. I checked on their web site that its either I call the hotline or go to the nearest Cebu pacific branch. What I did is I went to their branch in Puerto Princesa to asked for the travel fund their staff has no knowledge about what to do on travel fund they gave me incomplete requirements needed for the refund. I specifically asked them what are the documents needed and the other staff told me just 2 government identification but only to find out that I still need an authorization letter from my sister. Ive been coming back many times because the supervisor whose supposed to do the refund is not around because shes the only authorize to do it according to them .. it took 11 hours for the travel fund to finished.. They are very incompetent.
Kuala Lumpur to Toronto via Taipei. I am an EVA Air convert. Seating is comfortable and the service is great. There was a stop overnight stay in Taipei and we were looked after as soon as we arrived. They quickly took us to the airport hotel. As it was a stop for about 24 hours a day tour was offered but we took the bus to Taipei to see the famous 101 building. Savoured the local delights and bused back to the airport. The airport hotel has good selection for breakfast. Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely fly EVA when we next travel to the east.
Its hard for me to write a review because I am not sure if the airline always cancels flights or if it is just problematic to leave from Sudan. My flight was suddenly canceled twice. One of the times it was canceled was right before departure after I already took and paid for my covid test. It was incredibly stressful. I wrote to an assistant on whatsapp who told me it was a computer error and that my flight will still go and that I should just go to the airport. But I felt it was not this way I called. Thankfully someone helped me and put me on a flight with Ethiopian airlines and I flew with them via Ethiopia. So in the end i never flew with Kenya Airways. It was an incredibly stressful experience and dealing with people over the phone was impossible. In the end the woman I spoke to was the only helpful person and putting me on a new flight with another airline helped a lot. From what I read they cancel often. If it wasnt for this woman at the end I would give them a very low rating.
My minor daughter flew on Frontier. First the plane was delayed four hours. She was expected to arrive around 10 pm but didnt arrive until almost 2 am. Second when I arrived at the airport to pick her up no one was at the counter amd no one was expected to be at the counter until after 3 am. So I could not get a security pass to meet her at the gate. I tried calling Frontier but its system hung up on me. All airlines should always have someone at the counter at all times. This is completely unacceptable.
Its not about the flight I already took but the one I was supposed to take back. I booked through an agent in Morocco was supposed to return in May but the Delta airline not me not the travel agent changed my dates of travel which messed up everything then they tell me because I didnt book through them specifically they wont do anything about accommodating a different day since I couldnt travel on the day the gave me. How messed up is that this mega airline is so shameless that just because I didnt book straight through them even when it was them that changed my dates they wont do anything which totally messes up everything for me do they care No Their attitude iswhat they kept saying you didnt book through us so we cantwont do anything about it I will never fly Delta again.
SydneyBallinaSydney. Was really impressed with both flights. The small cabin was not an issue on 80min flights. Seats comfortable and adequate room. Only recommendation is to not take too much carryon baggage as there is limited storage space. Both ways the flight attendants were helpful and happy. Great addition to both flights were the FAs who stopped to have a chat to passengers after they had served the small snack either a museli bar or packet of shapes and either teacoffeewater. On the flight up we were delayed 90mins due to mechanical problems. The weather in Byron meant some baggage had to be taken off so extra fuel could be put on board in case of diversion. Staff were helpful and dealt with it in a professional manner sending the remaining bags up on the afternoon Virgin flight. Id recommend REX over Virgin and Jetstar. I payed less than half for the REX airfare than what the other two were offering and was twice as happy flying with them.
Holguin to Havana last week. Okay apart from issuing duplicate boarding cards to different passengers. Return was in a turbo prop plane which was 1 hour late and was infested by cockroaches running along the floor overhead lockers and electrical ducts. The plane was generally dirty. Obvious lack of maintenance.
I recommend ZIPAIR. My friend and I booked a flight on Zipair because it was cheap. Once we booked we noticed the website was hard to navigate the app we were supposed to download preflight isnt available in the US yet and there werent many reviews. We Googled Zipair to make sure it was a real airline. The moment we checked in we realized this airline is real and its an amazing deal. The customer service reps at check in asked if wed been to Japan before and what we were excited about doing while quickly and efficiently checking us in. It was a great start but were concerned about seat comfort and inflight Wifi. As we entered the plane we realized seat comfort was not an issue. The seats were a clean comfortable leather and had more leg space than most American carriers. Once we got in the air the Wifi connected quickly so we could access email and order food. Its not strong enough to download movies or tv shows so do that before you board. Food options are limited they run out quick if you dont preorder. I suggest eat early or bring your own food. Beverages were comparably priced with other airlines and it didnt seem to run out of any drinks. The inflight staff was very attentive and kept trash out of the aisles and seat backs the entire flight. Our return trip from Tokyo to San Francisco was exactly the same. Friendly staff during check in comfortable seats quick WiFi for ordering food and checking email and very attentive flight attendants. My friend and I agreed wed definitely recommend ZipAir to others and would fly them again.
I flew on Air France from Atlanta GA July 7th to Casablanca Morocco via Paris. They lost my bag between Paris Casablanca. I called their Customer Support line. They never found my bag. I called frequently to no avail. Air France couldnt or wouldnt call Casablanca for me. They gave me for Casablanca but no one spoke English. I was never reimbursed for new clothes I had to buy or contents of my bag. Im out several hundred dollars because of this. I had 1 pair pants 1 tshirt tennis shoes. It was 113 out. I was on a tour so not much time to get other clothes shoes toiletries etc. I got no help from Air France at all. It was a horrible experience. Our guide even tried to help to no avail. I lost some very sentimental items in my bag. What a disappointment that trip was.
Worst Airline Ever I never write these but this is terrible. My recently widowed sister her 4 kids grandparents my wife and I were supposed to take our First family trip. This company just ruined Christmas for these kids then we rebooked for New Years and now 16 hrs before our new flight Sunwing decided that SK doesnt deserve vacations until Feb. We will never book Sunwing again They will surely disappoint you and their customer service is beyond terrible. NO communication. Not trustworthy.
Bangkok to Paris CDG. Flight was delayed nearly one hour on outward leg and 30 mins on return. I am tall and had no space for my legs very tiny if compared with other airlines. Flight attendants do the minimum job not even giving water during the flight when you seat on window seat its always hard to ask the others to move just to go and catch a glass of water. No choice for food its either chicken or chicken very basic but thats fine this is economy. I took Air France for the price and direct flight but service is very basic boarding is chaotic in Paris airport. I wont fly Air France again. Screen are so tiny and quality of movies is very poor.
Hong Kong Istanbul Copenhagen on B777300 and A321 respectively. Flew 56 September 2017. Both flights on time. I arrived very early due to few connections to HKG from my departure town Danang by Vietnam with a LCC carrier Jetstar. Thus I had to leave transit and pick luggage after immigration. However I could not check in early in HKG so I had to take the Airport Express train and backtrack myself some 40 km downtown for city check in which is possible 8 hours prior to departure while in Airport only 4 hours are granted. The city checkin took 2 minutes when finally there but to access the Kowloon station in question for city checkin took me 1 hour. By checking in there I got rid of my luggage and the BP issued granted me lounge access upon returning to HKG airport. I tried all three Staralliance lounges and found Silverkris having the best food drinks and staff while the Thai and United lounges had stunning panorama view towards the tarmac making up for modest food and drink supplies and no champagne and very few staff. Onboard the FAs are friendly and caring. However all appear to be of only one Turkish nationality. This is a pity as they obvious have received limited internal training which results in a less perfect flight experience as the FAs in general have lower skills and possess limited modest exposure. The wandering cook onboard is superfluous in my view and makes a clown out of himself. IFE good. Headphones were of superb quality Devon. Chairs turned into spacious flat beds. Full set of bedsheets provided. Toilets clean throughout. Food was very good with options. Two full meal rounds served on this 12 hour flight plus dine on demand was apparently possible hot snacks. Drinks fine with G.H. Mumms champagne. Transit in Istanbul is normally a hassle but this time it went smooth and no queues. CIP lounge is a breeze I had nice shower and a delicious breakfast. The last sector ISTCPH was on an A321200 with true business class seats 2 x 2 configuration and good service including offering champagne in minibottles. Only 6 seats were occupied out of 20 on this morning flight. IFE also good.
New York to Bangkok via Seoul. Both Sections were on A380. First the good news planes were immaculately clean staff were superb throughout food was great on first leg not so good on BKK section. Both planes were delayed we had received notification that the JFK to ICN flight times had changed about one hour later departure but we left about another one after this this. It appears that OZ221 is always late leaving JFK its not the airport issue as the KE a380 seems to leave on time every day around the same time. Connection at ICN was tight but the plane was delayed once we had boarded. Food option poor only two choices on ICN to BKK no Korean option Movie choice on ICN to BKK poor only 4 Hollywood movies. The price was keen and would use again.
Terrible delays. Had to rebook our domestic travel for 5 passengers and havent received any reimbursement on the same. Lost all my luggage received luggage after 4 days. Had to purchase new clothes for the family for a wedding. No customer service rep picks up the phone.
I have flown with this airline when it was still a top airline choice for anyone traveling offering two luggages and a carry on entertainment and complimentary food and water. I just finished getting off my flight and I have have to say it is not what it used to be. We get there and only a carryon is allowed and there was no complimentary food or beverage options on a nonstop 6hour flight. Apart from that the seats were extremely uncomfortable and since I am of elderly age I do not have a credit card and they do not accept cash for an outrageously small cup of water for 3.00. I believe that they should at least offer a complimentary cup of water in nonstop flights for the elderly aged since this is completely unacceptable and should be illegal.
Chicago to Toronto they allowed overbooking resulted in finding volunteers in current flight to move to next flight and resulted in delaying. I was very surprised by the fact that they allowed overbooking and they had to find 4 volunteers to move to the next flight. The crew member mentioned that the current flight will not be going anywhere until they find volunteers to move to the next flight. Is this a joke Its a simple math that if the flight is full they should not take any more customers but it happened. Not only this delayed the departure time they provided no compensation whatsoever for people who waited to meet their schedule this is outrageous. They are ruthless when it comes to customers being late to board on the flight and if its other way around they want our patience very frustrating. Another problem was that the flight landed in Cleveland to fuel their gas. This was very upsetting because this implies that they did not fully fuel their gas to get to Toronto. I cant stop myself thinking that they cant do math. This delayed another 2 hours or so and we finally landed to Toronto at 500 pm instead of 231 pm. I have nothing more to say about this airplane other than its stupid and lazy. Only good thing to talk about is that the flight crew lady on the plane was very nice and tried her best to keep us calm. She needs a raise for covering others problems.
Washington to Addis Ababa via Istanbul . Although the flight and flight crew on my trip from DC to Addis were lovely the crew plane food and customer service on my return trip were horrendous. The food served between Istanbul and DC return flight was obviously spoiled and several people were sick as a result. The flight crew did nothing to reduce the impact mess smell from this. The plane itself was dirty and several of the seats damaged in the economy class area. The restrooms within the first 23 hours of the flight ran out of toilet paper and the floors became covered in urine and worse. Upon arrival in DC my checked luggage was returned badly damaged hard sided suitcase with a giant crack in the hard case. Turkish Airlines has refused to compensate me for the damage despite filing all the appropriate documents.
SINSEZ B767200.Meal served very tasty. Aircraft clean and seats werent too bad in terms of comfort. Flight only half full. No seatback AVOD but main screen showing movies on old VHS reel. Impressed with service and professionalism of crew. Water runs by crew through flight. Whilst not near the standards of larger airlines I was impressed with flight and Air Seychelles overall.
First time for a long time with Emirates normally I would use Etihad and first time A380 business class. Overall a curatess egg. However you come to expect more from Emirates particularly given the cost of their flights. The good points check in and bag delivery was excellent as was the chauffeur service to from DXB. The cabin appeared spotless though all was not as it seemed. The crew were immaculate and charming if a little robotic. The quibbles boarding at DXB was chaotic. It should not take nearly 2 hours to clear queuing passengers into the gate the flight eventually leaving 90 minutes behind schedule. On the flight to CAN I was not welcomed onboard or offered a drink or a drink order taken on the return. If paying top dollar there is an expectation FAs keep tabs on their assigned passengers. However the biggest disappointment was the food. Id preordered vegetarian. On the outward leg I was presented what I considered at the time to be the most uninspired slop Id seen in nearly 50 years of flying boiled mixed vegetables in a tasteless sauce on couscous. Until my return flight that is. A dish of boiled noodles with a squirt of neat tomato puree on top and accompanies by half a dozen near raw peas in their pods. The excellent sweet did not compensate. The FA apologized and offered any selection from the menu as an alternative. Trouble is unlike other full fare airlines including for economy class Etihad Emirates offers no vegetarian or vegan options. One assumes Emirates management would rather vegetarians stay away. Henceforth I shall duly support this policy. I strongly recommend other vegetarians do likewise. Finally I enjoy watching wildlife programmes as part of IFE. What I appreciate less is being entertained through the night by the antics of a cockroach presumably making its way home through my seating area disappearing into the seat recess in front. Where theres one therell be many more. Which rather sums up Emirates a glossy veneer but rather grubby beneath.
This is a bad airline. I travelled with Kenya airways on the 20th of May 2023 and now is the 26 May 2023 and l havent received my bag. I was told the bags were left in Kenya. I have made several phone calls to Zimbabwe and also here l have visited their office in Dubai they are not giving mey bag. This is my last time to travel with Kenya airways.
Covid form is broken Called customer service twice on different times and they hung up due to being too busy to pick up the phone. 1 hour flight delay was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as most storage compartments where empty when I entered the plane. I explained that I really cannot afford to wait on my luggage as I have 3 hours drive left after I arrive at the airport. In short totally not customer friendly. Will try to avoid flying next time with BA.
45 minutes into boarding they turn off the screens so you cant watch or listen to anything they do the same 45 minutes before landing. The head phones are extremely uncomfortable. The food is terrible. I wont be flying Bamboo ever again It was uncomfortable the seat wouldnt go back the seat in front of me was broken and hanging where my feet were.
I have to say travelling in Club Europe is a waste of money. The food was no better than economy food from the past. The seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people. This might be a British trait as Ive travelled business class on other airlines and not had the same experience.
My wife and I travelled back to the UK from Thailand on 18th March 2021. We checked in at the Qatar Airways desk about 4 hours before departure and we very thankful that we had got to the airport so early as all our documents for the return trip i.e. Certificate of a Negative Covid Test the UK governments Passenger Locator Form and the receipt for the two obligatory Covid tests that are required by the UK government when in selfisolation within the UK were meticulously checked by checkin staff the whole process taking 25 minutes. Boarding the aircraft at Bangkok was the most professional and well controlled that I have ever experienced at Bangkoks Suvarnabhumi Airport whereas they normally descend into chaos as soon as boarding is announced. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the modernity and cleanliness of the aircraft that we boarded everything we needed for the flight e.g. facemasks hand cleanser ear plugs etc were all neatly arranged in the seat pockets in front of us. The cabin crew were very smartly dressed and neatly turned out and they were very polite attentive and visibly present throughout the whole flight. The inflight meals were of the very highest standard and probably the best that I have ever been served on a flight back to the London. We arrived in Doha on schedule and boarded flight at the correct time and the boarding was conducted with the same proficient manner as out first flight. The London bound plane was absolutely jammed pack but the cabin crew although extremely busy behaved with the same quiet and firm professionalism that I had experienced throughout. I witnessed an incident whereby a passenger removed his facemask and refused to put it back on this passenger was immediately dealt with in a very firm and thoroughly professional manner which was very reassuring for other passengers around. I was impressed all round by the carrier and I certainly will consider using Qatar Airways in the future.
Probably one of the most horrible flight in my life. There is just nothing right with this company from the checkin delay handling to security in the cabin and complaint handling. Flight was delayed over 3 hours because of supposedly bad weather conditions while other airlines were flying just fine for the same routes. Left without ANY updates of confirmed departure time and more importantly we were refused the ability to cancel our tickets. We were not offered any food or drink for our over 3 hours wait in the terminal. Staff English at the counter was below acceptable as they were barely able to understand questions in regards to how to deal with my music instrument. Staff on board failed to give instruction in English. I was addressed multiple times in THAI which I do not speak and I wasnt even given the chance to ask what it meant. Ground staff at arrival Lost and Found counter dont speak English at all. Call center called 18th March 320PM excuses failure to follow laws and basic security and information requirements by We are a low cost airline.
We are living a nightmare with this company. My parents and my niece 5 years old were supposed to fly ClujIstanbulChicago in July 26th 2021. They flew from Cluj to Istanbul waited there 6.55 hours to board to Chicago. When they were about to enter the plane people from the gate took their tickets and passports without any explanation and they werent allowed to enter the plane. So I called them and they said they got orders from Chicago Airport not to allow my parents to enter the US. We contacted the US Custom Border Protection and they said there is no restrictions for people that come from Romania like my parents. My parents waited 30 hours in the airport to find a solution and then they had to buy a ticket to fly back to Cluj. Weve been trying to find a solution to this mess for 3 days. Turkish airline gave us answers like check the US restrictions which we did and there is no restrictions for us. They dont answer the question why didnt they allow my parents to go to Chicago. Their call center people said they dont have access to see or do more than that. The truth is that they didnt know Romania is not in the Schengen Area and somebody made a huge mistake. We are still waiting the answer to our 15 calls and 5 complaints.
LHRASB. Busy flight mostly passengers to Amritsar. No inflight entertainment not even map. No duty free magazine or alcohol. Main food service tasty curry choice of veg or meat. Crew ok but English not first language. Toilets clean. Over hour delay in take off from Heathrow probably due to few checkin posts being open. Landed on time. Return flight was not as busy room to swap seats. Map this time and crew ok and remembered to get me black tea without asking.
Rome to Los Angeles was the worst flight experience Ive had. The first problems occurred when we tried to check in online with Alitalias website it took over 3 hours just to check in and print boarding passes. I tried to to call Customer Service for help to no avail. Onboard the seats are narrow and theres no leg room. The passenger in front of me kept trying to recline his seat which almost placed his head in my lap and made it nearly impossible to watch a movie which may or may not have been a good thing because their inflight entertainment leaves a lot to be desired. The movie screen is only about 4 X 6 and my entertainment system continually crashed. We rarely saw flight attendants throughout the flight and even if you pressed the call button no one came. The mealssnacks were less than mediocre. The one snack we received was a tuna salad sandwich. When I asked if they had any other sandwich choice the flight attendant asked if I had requested a special meal due to food allergies. When I told her no she went and got me 2 small packets of their crackers. Beverage service was lacking twice I asked for a glass of water I never received it. About 2 hours into the flight I used the bathroom only to find less than 14 roll of toilet paper sitting on the sink counter.
Cuenca to Quito. Second flight cancelled in the space of a week after checking in at the airport. First one resulted in a 3 hour delay after rerouting from Guyaquil to Cuenca via Quito. This one is an 8 hour delay leaving us no choice but to remain in Cuenca airport. Just an 8dollar lunch voucher offered as compensation. Staff were friendly but information given was haphazard. Seats on other flights have been old and ragged food very poor. Would avoid if you can find another carrier.
London Heathrow to Amman. It was my first time to fly the A321 exBMI aircraft in business class on BA and I really like the layout that feels so spacious. The service was great throughout and the cabin crew were active in checking if passengers needed anything. The checkin queues in Amman were annoying but other than that this LondonAmmanLondon trip reminded me of how flying used to be.
Montreal to Cayo Coco. This was the worst flightcompany I have ever dealt with. On April 29th at 345am I get to the Montreal airport where I am to board the 7am flight to Cuba Cayo Coco. Upon my arrival I am told that the flight has been delayed to 950pm when I left my house at 300am the flight was still on for 700am. They told us that they were giving our plane to the flight for Cayo Largo that was supposed to leave the day before. All in all we waited in Montreal airport for 19 hours. After a lot of arguing Cubana Airlines hired Sunwing to take us to Cayo Coco. We had to wait in the plane from 11pm to 12h 30am because Cubana Airlines had to give a document to them. Finally arrived to destinationhotel at 530am the next day. On our way back Cubana was on time no issues there. The issues however came up with the plane itself. It was the most decrepit plane I have ever seen and flown. I get to my seat get my bagages settled only to find that I can not actually sit in my seat without have the back of the seat lay down on the passengers lap that was sitting behind me. With a a lot arguing with the stewardess they finally changed my seat they actually wanted me to sit there the whole time without resting my back. Get myself settled again to only have someone comme up to me and tell me that this was their seat. This happened to me 3 other times I finally get a seat that no one claims but the plane was dirty. This plane looked like it had not been cleaned since its inauguration it was just downright dirty. You get what you pay for but seriously this was beyond that. Never ever again will I fly Cubana Airlines.
First flight was poor seat backs were like bricks no food no viewing screens. 3 hr flight. Second flight had a problem so had to get off the plane and wait on another. 1st plane seat was good but when seated back on new aircraft same seat number it turned out to be a seat with no seat in front good some would say for leg room but the tray table did not fold and as Im a large guy could not get it down. There was no headphone for the screen which seemed odd. The original girl beside me had switched with her husband and he being a large guy as well made the flight awkward. He was much larger than me. The best is the food. Piece of chicken with cauliflower and spinach. Not nice at all with a tiny bread bun. Salad bowl thing which I passed on and a chocolate wafer bar. Poor offerings and not plentiful at all. Landing was only an hour late so no worries but before we landed at 5.30 pm we were given a small box contain 2 wet hash browns and a few mushrooms with an omelette on more spinach. Breakfast. The seats were fine the staff were nice but I really think this was like a budget long haul flight. And I will not be flying with them again until people start raving about how good they are. One more thing Dublin had 2 of the worst and slowest check in staff out of 3 appalling how they did not show any interest in being professional.
Perth to Nice via Dubai. I used to love flying Emirates. What has happened Very expensive flights to Nice and service is terrible. I pressed the bell 6 times and the second time 4 times on another connecting flight but no one showed up. The service from Europe was no better. I waited over 15 minutes to use a toilet in business and then one of the hostesses came out with her makeup bag there was a line for both toilets. Service so slow and they act like they are doing you a favour. I asked for a red wine and got a cup of tea When I mentioned this I still did not get the red. Two Sauvignon blancs is not smart for a choice of white wines. On board ICE entertainment system clumsy. Chaffeur did not confirm and we had to chase them to see if we were being picked up for two legs of the trip website section said booked but empty. Business lounge outdated and they have the childrens play room down in the smoking section. What has happened to my favourite airline
Istanbul to Budapest. They overbooked the flight and even though we were checked in 24 hours before the flight they didnt let us on the plane and didnt even give us options if we want to stay or go like other airlines when they over book. And no answer at the gate The guy totally ignored us and finally when we complained they lied to us about having another flight leaving in 2 hours and they will send us with business class. It took us more than 2 hours to finally getting help and leaving 7 hours later. Finally they sent us tot he denied office which took them forever to help us. I would never fly with them again.
Luxembourg to Madrid on Boeing 737800 in Economy. Check in easy no line and friendly agent. No line at security and into the gate area with plenty of seats. Not much choice for food one restaurant with snacks. Around 80 full cabin friendly attendants welcome on board in EnglishFrenchLuxembourgese. Departed 15 min late due to baggage loading. Good flight overall just over 2 hours and served a snack and drinks. They had some entertainment on the dropdown screens but I was watching my own Ipad. Flightmap would pop up here and there to let us know where we were. Landed in Madrid at T4 and bags were out pretty fast. A good flight for US150.
Id booked a flight from Surabaya to Bandung on August 8th 2019 but because of a sudden meeting schedule required me to reschedule my flight on August 06th 2019. I paid 663k Rupiahs for the rescheduling administration but I got my flight delayed for 2 hours without any proper announcements just from the display on the airport. And the airline gave the passengers the compensation rice noodle spicy beef after I asked about it. If I dont have a meeting required me to attend early in the morning I would have bought the tickets from another flight providers.
Flew from Barbados to St Martin via Antigua. Flight to Antigua no problems but transfer from Antigua to st Martin was a joke Cancelled flight with no direction from staff at airport. Poor staff being given hassle found out same flight cancelled yesterday as well and other reports continued cancellations. Shocking service and a disgrace. This airline clearly needs competition.
Sydney to Doha. I have flown with Qatar Airways a couple of times before. Great service. Fantastic food. Great airport in every way Doha Hamad is big and stunning. Service from cabin crew amazing at all times very helpful.
Hong Kong to San Francisco. I am typing this on the flight. Todays experience has not been great. Many disappointments from the checkin counter and now on the flight. We are flying with an infant. While I appreciate the airline is giving priority to passenger with infant or special needs there are still quite a few things lacking to the overall service. Instead of a long write up below is a list of things we have encountered so far. Assistant at the checkin counter is impatient. Speak so low and unclear. She let off when she found out our stroller is one piece instead of two because she printed two baggage claim tickets for the stroller. Promised baby food before takeoff never arrives. Flight attendant is not apologetic when closing the overhead baggage compartment loudly on top of our sleeping baby. Overhead compartment has two large greenflat bags belong to the airline. We are lucky to fit all our small bags there. Typical hand carry baggage definitely wont fit. A passenger sitting not far from us dropped his food tray and made a mess. The same flight attendant a guy walked by twice without even offering help. That is terrible. In general all attendants seem to be very busy doing their thing. I am not seeing customer servicecare in my recent flights with CX anymore. I have been flying mostly with CX for years. It is sad to see their customer service going down.
I cannot say enough good things about Zipair. First and foremost is the excellent price for a round trip ticket from LA to Tokyo. With the current exchange rate you can go Business class for under 2000 RT or for under 900 if you fly economy. This is with all the upgrades added. You will spend a little more on snacks and drinks but that is even cheap with our current exchange rates. The seats are all comfortable and their internet is free. I would recommend downloading some shows prior to take off as the internet did drop a couple of times.
San Francisco to Los Cabos. Virgin America has always been a good airline and this flight was nice and easy They have tons of entertainment on their screen Wifi is very expensive at 16. A couple of our family members had trouble with the remotes not fully working but overall a great airline to fly
Flight was cancelled. Actually destination was cancelled and we werent notified. Apparently NOK stopped flying to Mae Hong Son in April 2023 but still took a payment from us for two tickets. No notification from NOK whatsoever. We had to arrange flight to Chiang Mai obvs with a more reliable airline and a 6 hour bus to Mae Hong Son. The booked and paid for flight was scheduled for 14 days prior to this review still no contact or refund from NOK despite several attempts by me to contact them.
New York JFK to Duesseldorf. The worst service in a business class cabin Ive received. There was nothing that I could say positive about this flight 7481 of Air Berlin departing April 8 from JFK to Dusseldorf. Arrived at JFK with more than 3 hours in advance. There were people in the priority business line waiting because the two staff that attended the site were gone for a break and no other attendance paid attention to us. Suddenly another travelers that arrived after us were allowed to go through and when I complained a very young man responded that they were attending first the Berlin passengers was no way this gentleman could know without asking whether I was going also to Berlin When we arrived at the time of boarding we were told at the counter that there was going to be a 25 minutes delay we had to wait for an hour without anybody explaining what was going on. We later found out that they had to switch the aircraft and make the catering. When we finally boarded never were we were approached by our names I had to wear my jacket since nobody came to ask for it. Food bad catering but that was not all. My dinner selection was Rissotto with a pinot grigio the staff brought me the rissotto with a red wine when I told her that that was not my wine and that I order the grigio I think I spoke in esperanto since she had no idea what I was talking about I said white wine and she said ok and she never came back with the wine. Tire of waiting I sipped a horrible red wine and my wife took it and changed it for a chardonnay she was having. Dessert with the whole tray occupied with the other plates. The cabin was a mess the flight staff spent the flight running coming and going and that is the reason why I did not have the chance to request for some better treatment. My only comfort was that this was a 6 hours flight. At the end when we were to land the flight attendant asked me to put my jacket back since I couldnt have it in my hands. A business ticket with an economy class treatment.
Hyderabad to Seattle via Dubai. Even though I had booked the ticket for my spouse and 11 month old kid with bassinet Emirates did not honor the ticket and rejected my spouse request for providing the bassinet and forced her to sit with my son on her lap. She could neither eat properly the whole journey nor was she able to take rest even for a bit on top of that the rudeness of staff worsened her experience of the trip. She never want to fly Emirates again.
Santiago to Puerto Montt return. Flights on time service efficient and polite although not over the top. Aged B737200 well over 20 years old but that is one of the reason I selected Sky. For the cost cant really go wrong and would recommend for anyone who either is price conscious or loves flying different aircraft.
London Heathrow to Newark return. Having just returned from my holiday flying with British Airways in their World Traveller Plus class I thought I would post my review. The week before we flew we paid the 48 per person to select our seats so I had the comfort of knowing we would be sat together. We flew out of T5 at LHR one what I think is one of BAs new 787 to Newark at 10.35am and plane interior looked new and clean. We took our seats 21 J and K which were right next to the toilets. On our seats we found a small pillow blanket headphones and an amenity kit. I had plenty of leg room ok I am 55 and my partner had the entertainment box impacting his leg room but he seemed to be ok with it he is 510. Although our seats were next to the toilets we didnt get disturbed movement or smells. Once the curtain was pulled between us and World Traveller you wouldnt have known we were by the bathrooms. We were offered a glass of something fizzy water and juice were also available. Hot towels were handed out. Menus were handed out and main course was a choice of beef or chicken with a pasta salad to start and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert with cheese and biscuits. The food was ok it was hot and tasted good. The food service was quick and prior to the food served drinks were handed out including a drink for the meal. However during food service another drink was also offered. So three small bottles of wine for the flight and I was well on my way to relaxing and starting my holiday. As we didnt have anyone behind us we could recline our seats without worrying about disturbing anyone. As there was a wall behind us we couldnt recline as far back as others but it was comfortable enough. Luckily for both of us the people in front of us didnt really recline theirs too far. The seat was really comfortable and even with my generous back side I felt I had plenty of room. Although I had loaded up my tablet with films and books I didnt use it at all. Neither did I use the vast choice of IFE I used to 6.5hour flight time to have some me time. My partner found plenty of choice and enough to watch during the flight. After food the mood lighting was switched on and stayed that way until we were an hour from landing. Most people me included took the opportunity to have a bit of shut eye. A sandwich and small chocolate bar tea and coffee was served and after a quick freshen up in my seat. The pilot announced we would be landing and that the toilets would only be available for another 20 minutes or so. I quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up but what was annoying was the number of people who decided to have almost a full make over in the toilets spending 10 or more minutes in there whilst the queue of people waiting to use the facilities grew longer. However the toilets were clean. The landing was smooth and we arrived on time I suppose you would say we were 20 minutes early but dont the airlines have that little trick of appearing to land early On leaving the plane I did have a look at Business Class and without offending regular Business Class users I did wonder exactly what you get for your money. All the pods looked very tightly packed together.
The flight itself was fine however dealing with our baggage which they lost has been absolutely terrible. When we arrived at our final destination our checked baggage along with 25 other passengers was missing. After 3 days Qatar has not been able to locate our baggage or supply the last known location. The baggage department does not answer the phone their email or their WhatsApp chat function. When I got ahold of someone in the reservations department they told me these things take time. We are extremely disappointed with the service from Qatar.
Taipei to Toronto. We flew EVA home from Asia in business class and this was the first time we had used them. Our routing was Taipei to Toronto a 13 hours plus flight. The Boeing 777 aircraft looked super clean and fresh. Even during mid flight the galley area where the lavatory was situated was super spotless and tidy. I loved the business class configuration it is the best I have used so far. Everything was designed to maximize passenger comfort and space. The details of the seat were well thought out with lots of space and shelves to hold your stuff. The seat was the most comfortable I have experienced for sleep wider and lie flat surface longer than any other so far. The pillow was plush and large and the blanket thick and warm. PJs and a thin mattress also available if desired. I had no trouble sleeping well on our over night flight despite lots of turbulence. The food service included dinner and a breakfast just before arrival. I chose Chinese style cuisine for both and they were delicious. Food presentation was excellent. EVA paid attention to little details for example chopstick and spoon holders were an elegant touch. The young ladies FA did amazing job. They worked super hard and served with a smile despite same shift for 14 hours. The amenity kit was placed in a Rimowa silver container very nice. Two lavatories up front one bigger than the other with wood floors and hand cloth towels to wash our face and paper cups to brush our teeth again great attention to customer service. All in all very impressive airline and my best flight to date. Wish I can use EVA all the time.
LCYAMS. I wanted to fly to Eindhoven but Air FranceKLM charged extortionate fares for oneway flights. As Amsterdam Schipol is only 90 mins away from Eindhoven by train I thought I would give VLM a try. I wasnt disappointed The plane was clean and the drinks were served in glasses as opposed to plastic cups. The single sandwich was a bit stingy but of high quality. My only grumble with VLM is that the website initially displays fares not including taxes. Its only when you select the flights and proceed to booking that the price becomes comparable with other airlines. Other than that highly recommended
Bangkok to Seoul via Hong Kong. Both flights on time with orderly boarding. Both flights on the rather uncomfortable regional business class seats. Flight from Hong Kong to Seoul was downgraded on the last minute from herringbone Style lie flat seat to the regional seat. Service as always top notch lounges in Hong Kong great. The only let down was the downgrading of seat.
Delayed for 3 hrs and when all passengers seat in airplane they wait more than 30 min for another passengers. One of the worst airlines with cheap crews
I was flying from BOM to CUN using my unused Schengen Visa. Mexico immigration clearly says that a person having a valid Schengen Visa does not require a Mexico Visa to for shortterm travel to Mexico. Following the rules the Turkish Airlines staff boarded me and issued boarding passes from BOM to IST and IST to CUN. I reached IST and when I reached the boarding gate of my Mexico flight I was denied boarding by the Turkish Airlines staff citing that the Schengen Visa must be used before to travel to a Schengen country before flying to Mexico. This self made logic of theirs is ridiculous because firstly 1 Mexico govt simply mentions that any type of multi entry Schengen Visa is accepted. 2 A Visa is not an obligation to travel if I got a Schengen Visa that does not bound me to travel to Europe. 3 Also I know a couple of my friends who also flew to Mexico on their unused Schengen Visa with other Airlines and they were allowed entry to Mexico without any hassles at the Mexico airport immigration. After I was denied boarding at Istanbul IST airport gate I was made to run behind counter after counter but no one in the Turkish Airlines staff actually knew how to handle this situation and they demonstrated an utmost level of hostility and lack of empathy. Because of all this my entire trip got ruined. Now I have been waiting for a week for at least a full refund if not compensation for the mental agony they caused me but they are not responding and acting as if nothing happened.
There are many negative reviews on this site its almost embarrassing to admit to flying BA. I am adding another one. I have flown BA onof for 37 years. I guess that makes me qualified to write a review. My main gripe is the total lack of value for money. The erosion of quality and services and the sky rocketing prices. This flight from Heathrow to Barcelona and the return accentuates the lack of value. Barcelona flights operates out of Terminal 3 at LHR. Quite why BA use this ageing and outdated terminal is a mystery. You walk miles and if you are unfamiliar with this point as we were you end up running a panicked race to the gate. Its worse on arrivals. Immigration and passport control was a zoo. The T3 Business lounge is mediocre Plastic tables and chairs. The most awful selection of dried out bacon baps and dried out omelettes stuffed into baguettes. The seating areas overlooking the airport was cluttered with newspapers. There was plenty of booze. Flight left on time. The meal inflight I could not be bothered with. FAs all fine. On the return the shared lounge was surprisingly good. More comfortable than T3 at LHR. Ageing plane. Mediocre afternoon tea. Frumpy FAs who forgot to hand out our Fast Track tickets to help speed up through immigration. We got held up for half an hour. On both flights we had to endure the silly Club Europe seats basically two seats with the middle seat closed down into a table. Cramped leg room. Definitely no value here. I only fly BA when I have to. It really needs a clean out of the management and a new team with some vision on how to make British Airways a world leader which right now they fail miserably to achieve in all their cabins.
We flew from Montreal to Havana on the 22 February 2015 and back on the 27 and everything ran smoothly on both flights. The plane was on time and the personnel onboard were ok. The plane and the toilets were clean. It is the third year in a row that I have flown with Cubana and I have nothing to complain about. Great value for the money. It is basic transportation but for a 4 hour flight we dont need more. If you want a newer airplane and more services take another airline and pay much more.
April 6th CSXSHA. On the flight to Shanghai the plane was very new and the lights in the cabin were warming and comfortable cabin crew were okay but not very impressive they were very rushed during the flight but understandable as it was only a 75 min flight. Inflight entertainment was a shared TV. Shanghai Airlines really need to improve their cabin crew on common knowledge during the crew announcements they mistakenly said Skyteam as Sky Alliance. Overall a satisfactory trip but not impressive.
Business class July 8th from JFK to Port of Spain. The seats were dirty with crumbs all over. When it came time for the meals no hot towels and the food was horrible and cold like some of the flight attendants. The entertainment was the worst the quality of the picture may as well have been in black and white.
Dubai to Prague with Emirates. I simply enjoyed the flight. The crew was very amicable open and easy to reach. The food was tasty plenty and you did not have a feeling you are eating on a plane but in a restaurant. Later they served snacks and drinks. Their wine is superb. Movie list never end and the quality of the picture is excellent. The only thing I minded were the seats they were way too narrow.
We flew from Athens to Mykonos and the way back to Athens on June 2023. We have tried to add bags via Voloteas website and app for both flights but the system was not working not allowing us to complete the purchase. We have tried then to contact via email and phone their client attention service and have just received general protocol replies. No human interaction existed. We had to pay 400 in total to carry our bags while buying them online would cost only a fraction of that. A real extortion we were left with no option. The worst service I have ever received from an airline.
I and my son travelled from Mumbai to LA via Doha Mum to Doha then Doha to LA on 6th Aug22. This was a personal trip. While I have been to US several times over last 17 years for business as well as personal trips it was a first trip to US for my son. My son will be pursuing MS at USC in LA and hence he needed extra luggage allowance. My past experience with Qatar is the primary reason I booked our flights with Qatar though it was not the cheapest option. I wanted to make sure that even if I had to cancel my travel plan at last minute my son will have hurdle free journey. However I was happy that I chose Qatar Airways. Every stage flight booking seat meal selection checkin inflight exp meals snacks inflight entertainment baggage handling was a pleasant experience. Qatar provided extra luggage allowance as student allowance to my son. Qatar also provided fullflight complimentary wifi to him as a student offer. We are vegetarians. Almost all airlines have vegetarian meal option but a handful provide good quality and tasty veg meals. Qatar veg meal was excellent. So was their choice of snacks and beverages. Staff was polite and friendly though we were in Economy. I have noticed a stark difference in airline staff behavior when they deal with Business versus Economy class passengers. Even in Economy their staff was cordial and caring. There were several passengers with variety of queries ranging from meal options to why satellitebased wifi was not working at certain times. Staff was answering and helping passengers with genuine interest. A couple of suggestions 1 Qatar should consider waiving off seat selection fees for middle seats. I had to pay for it as I wanted to make sure I travel together with my son 2 I am not sure if Qatar provides confirmation notification about successful luggage transfer in connecting flights. If they dont then they must consider providing this notification as it will serve as a huge relief for the passengers that their luggage is not left behind. Some other airlines do provide such notifications either via their app or SMS.
Paris CDG to Los Angeles. Good food crew entertainment and leg space. I enjoyed the whole island theme that was experienced onboard. A plus about the entire experience was the level of visibility and attention the crew provided with frequent water runs and prompt responses to call bell. Another feature was the snack bar set up at the galley for passengers. Flight departed and arrived on time.
Brisbane to London via Taipei. Overall EVA Air has a good product. The aircraft are clean and modern food of reasonable standard and Flight Attendants efficient. As Australians and hence English speaking communication was at a minimum with us. Announcements were very difficult for me to hear on all flights. Premium Economy seats were good but passengers in front reclined seats for full journey making our seats and activity in flight very uncomfortable. TPEL airport is not customer friendly when you need to transfer and seems to be focused on Asian passengers. EVA Air scheduled a day layover on return leg from Paris to Taipei but this was not a easy process for viewing the city with delays at security.
11 Dec flights 3311 and 8028 economy. Attention at the airports and on board was excellent. TAM is really improving. Food was the normal cheese and ham sandwich to GRU then a better snack with a better sandwich GRU to SCL. What was nice was the attendants passed by 3 times offering drinks something unusual but very welcome in economy. I also like the attention paid to safety on board as the crew were far more conscious of it than on other airlines. For example we were not allowed to sit in emergency exit rows as we didnt speak Portuguese. I would have thought that speaking English would be good enough but I understand their point. Also there was a lot of turbulence across the Andes and they constantly reminded people to sit down which is also welcome. Im liking more this airline the more I choose them.
We had to travel from Mumbai to Mauritius. Air Mauritius flight MK749 got cancelled on 1772015 10 hrs before departure without an alternate flight arrangement. We had to book tickets from Mumbai to Mauritius via Dubai. Return flight of Air Mauritius on 2172015 MK748 to depart at 2120 hrs was rescheduled late by 3 hours at last moment without indication to passengers.
Most incompetent and hostile airport ground checkin crew I have ever seen during my many ears of travel. Three agents took 25 minutes to process a passenger with excess luggage. The supervisor was abscond until the last minute. Business class checkin counter was unmanned and unattended. Finnair business class standards are very low. Stay away from this airline.
Sydney to Madrid via Dubai. Being a Qantas FF I occasionally travel on Emirates but with a Qantas code on it. Now same aircraft A380 but the whole experience is totally different. Have been on Emirates a few times a year mostly when routing to a Europe port other than London. Sydney being the Qantas home base is these days very efficient to get through. Self check in even though i can use the First counter and through security and to the Qantas lounge in probably 15 minutes. The Emirates version is very different and rightly so as it is not home base. The economy line up was massive. Fortunately could use the premium line and was through swiftly. Time for Emirates to start using self check in. Used the superb Qantas First Lounge and then moved over to the Emirates lounge which was a very pleasant place. From there the whole experience was pretty dismal. Had a whole row to myself in the main cabin which was great. Same sights and sounds as for the Qantas A380 but its the customer service that lets Emirates down. They just simply have recruited too many young kids who just dont have the professionalism or charm of the slightly older crews on Qantas main line. Its really a training problem. Having crew that speak 30 languages on board is fine but does not help if their manner is to put it mildly rather brusque. Charm school is sorely missing. Mid flight snacks are poor to non existent. Food is a little underwhelming. Delayed start from Sydney due to bad weather and a tight connection meant a run through Dubai T3 to get to the Madrid flight. Same plane different crew but same lack of charm and professionalism. And Emirates...one other thing. Please do not have your crews take away blankets act as general cleaners and so on around 30 minutes before landing. It jut is not a great look. Overall the airline needs to employ proper training methods or better still get some older crew who can teach the young ones how to. The fact is that Emirates gets away with sloppy standards since they have a great network hard product in the A380 great airport in Dubai. For me it is the easiest way to get to Madrid from Sydney so have to get used to a substandard level of service which many people have commented on. I would recommend Emirates only as it has the route network and schedules. Bit short on other alternatives at that price point.
To me Emirates hasnt changed much since my last trip with them in 2013. It still offers free train ticket in Germany that connects your home to the airport. Flights from Munich to Beijing via Dubai were ontime. Onboard service was great with a good selection of food and alcoholicnonalcoholic drinks. I went for some vodka and they served me Russian Standard a premium vodka distilled in St. Petersburg. That was a pleasant surprise. The only downside of the trip was Munich airport. Emirates uses Munichs Terminal 1 which is very outdated and small especially so when being compared to Munich airports new Terminal 2. On our way back at Munich there were only 3 immigration windows and a small luggage carousel for the 500 passengers from a fully packed A380.
Barcelona to Mumbai via Doha in Economy class paid to upgrade to business on DOHBOM segment during online check in. On balance this was a good experience not great. BCNDOH on an A350 that apparently is owned by Latam and operated by Qatar. Branding was Qatar but business class configuration was pure Latam ie 2x2x2 hence when they asked for in excess of 700 Euro to upgrade for a 6.5 hour flight I passed. Economy was pleasant as the flight wasnt crowded and I had three seats to myself. I did opt to upgrade on the DOHBOM segment as it was a Qsuite configured aircraft and priced at just over 300 euro for a late night three hour flight arriving at 230am. India flights all running full post Jet Airways collapse so I thought it smart to upgrade. The Qsuite product is very good although I found the suite a bit claustrophobic. Service was good. Theres a bit of a cool demeanor with their cabin crews. Zero special treatment or recognition for Oneworld Emerald for seat allocation or onboard. The Doha lounge was overrated and almost appalling for me. In summary the trip was good not spectacular.
Dubai to Beijing in business class and what a mistake. I could have routed through Doha or Abu Dhabi but Emirates was a little cheaper for business class and now I know why. The Boeing 777 had seats in this cabin arranged 2x3x2 and being in the middle block I couldnt believe how cramped uncomfortable and positively horrible this is. One expects this from premium economy but not business. The IFE was okay but I had expected something much more and realised they bulk up the quantity by many multi national offerings and a plethora of old not proper classic movies that other airlines wouldnt bother with. The cabin staff performed their duties not with any friendliness or courtesy and Im glad my return route flights are arranged with China Southern who at least offer proper flat bed seats and comfort in business class. Never again via Dubai with Emirates.
Flew Qatar Airways from Doha to Sydney. The business class cabin is situated on the upper deck of the A380 behind the first class cabin. The seats are in a herringbone configuration of 121. They are very comfortable and can be converted to a full flat bed however some may find the leg space limited in the bed position. But still they are well ahead of most business seats of other airlines. The onboard service was excellent and smooth. Passengers can select when what and how many times they wish their meals to be served. It is a nice thing but it means that people eat in different times hence the flight attendants run up and down the cabin during the whole flight and smell of food is always present in the cabin. At the aft of the business cabin a full size bar can be found with canopies fruit and a bartender who serves cocktails. It is simply amazing The WiFi is free up to 10Mb but it did not really work to me and the selection of movies could be wider.
London CityFlorence return. Usual swift checkin at LCY. Halffull Avro RJ85 took off on time. Interior slightly worn but clean and seats comfortable with just about enough leg room Im 1.83 for the 2hr flight. Staff professional handed out drinks and sandwiches which were adequate but which could perhaps be upgraded slightly from slightly skimpy cheese or tuna mayonnaise. The basket of complimentary Belgan chocolate squares passed round later is a nice touch though. Return flight checkin handled by Air France at Florence. For some reason AF staff insisted that queuing passengers should print out their boarding cards from automated checkins before dropping baggage. Flight similarly smooth although delayed by about 20 minutes due to late incoming aircraft for which captain apologised. Cabin crew made a second sandwich run offering more to anyone who wanted them. Overall good flights that were less expensive and better quality than those offered by Meridiana the airline we have previously used for LondonFlorence trips.
Madrid to Johannesburg via Paris. Air Frances customer service is the worst Ive ever encountered with an airline. Having been delayed for a total of 26 hours they are refusing to pay any compensation despite me providing invoices for a rebooked flight from Johannesburg to Harare because I missed my original flight due to the delay. I was very unhappy with the manner in which I was dealt with on arrival in Pairs by the airline staff on the outgoing plane who told me I had nothing to worry about and would make my connection no information at the disembarking gate to say it was futile to go the boarding gate for a flight that had already closed and no assistance enroute at any stage in a very unbusy airport terminal. Also no compensation for having paid extra 85 euros for extra legroom seat which was not not available on my rebooked flight the following day.
Absolutely awful planning by the staff. They havent done one thing to help me and my flights were delayed for 3 hours making me miss my flight and making me travel to 3 other airports. They are a disaster. Im currently 36 hours on the planes my flight from Calgary to Edmonton is 1 hour long but instead Im going to Vancouver Kelowna then Edmonton with 13 hours of waiting if you have to be anywhere important make sure you plan for the delays.
Budapest to Reykjavik via Berlin. Probably the worst airline experience. The worst customer service nobody able to help you anyhow on their hotline and when you write them through their web form they dont respond. Lost all 4 of our checkin baggage which arrived 4 days after us. I calledwrote them several times asking how should we handle the lost baggage Ive got a serious reply the 11th day of our 12 day holiday. Except that we flew our first flight with some old Italian plane and crew should have been Air Berlin leg space was really small 3h 30 min flight without anything to drink.
Flew on this airline on the 16th August 2014 POSTAB and TABPOS. At checkin counter at Piarco their main operational hub checkin was 2 hours before flight. I got there 1.5 hours before flight and no one from CAL was at counter so there were long lines of irate passengers. Flight crew very cold and unfriendly. Return flight even though it was touted as new ATR aircrafts was not cleaned and maintained inside and the air conditioning wasnt working.
AmsterdamCancun bought Comfort Class seats. The cabin attendants were friendly food served was a little less good it wasnt bad just average. The legroom in Comfort Class was good and other benefits are the complimentary alcoholic beverages and personal media player that you get. So overall a satisfying flight.
Frankfurt to Sydney via Doha. All it was perfect. Perfect food perfect crew perfect time of flight all was perfect and fine. All crew work hard for economy class to do our flight the best they can.
The worst customer service My friend and I were traveling to Lima. On our way to Lima our flight was delayed for almost 12 hours we were supposed to land at 09.00 and instead came to Lima very late after 01.00 in the morning the next day. My luggage was also damaged on the way. While I was returning to LA. I had a checked luggage it was a small carry on 12.5 kg I had another carry on with me even smaller. While I was boarding the representative for Avianca at Lima Airport was very rude and inappropriate and kept arguing that I had to pay for that small carry on and charged me 80. Her attitude was very bad and inappropriate. Our plane was almost empty and there was space for every customer to take carryons. I flew so many times and this has never happened to me. Inadequate customer service Stay away from this company
Worst experience ever. Will never fly again. All they want is to find a way to charge you extra. Seats are cramped unprofessional behaviour of the staff late check in and late arrival and overall a horrible travel experience. I have flown enough low cost airlines in the world I would rate Air Asia as the worst ever.
Scoot was the worst budget airline I encounter. I recently took Scoot airlines from Singapore to Penang Malaysia on 17 Jun22. As I have checked in my luggage and upon arrival my luggage was spoilt. So I made a complain to the ground staff and was requested to fill up the form for claim. Since then I have been following up numerous time and it is already more than 1 month and yet to get any reply.
At least 4 inches more legroom in economy class than most other airlines Ive flown. It makes such a big difference in terms of comfort and its not something for which they charge more. With that much legroom it doesnt matter if the passenger in front of you fully reclines. A lot of movie selections on the entertainment system and the food and service was good quality. However I would recommend that if you are vegetarian that you place the meal request prior to flying because I saw two meal servings that had no nonmeat options. The 14 hours of the flight went by faster than I expected.
They cancelled our flight and we asked for a refund one year ago it has been a full year and they did not refund our money yet. I wrote several emails and called several times but they keep saying in process and did not refund the money back. The worst airlines in the world
The crew on Emirates are superb staff that look like they love their jobs. It was the little touches that made a difference like taking a Polaroid of the kids for them to take as a souvenir or wearing Happy New Year head gear as we were flying on New Years Eve. Seats had a lot of leg room. I was sat next to the window and didnt feel claustrophobi probably as the planes walls dont curve in so much on the lower deck and the windows are so large. Main problems were the IFE wasnt working properly plus the system was trying to offer too much i.e. loads of films without much thought gone into the execution and ease of use of it. Other problem was the food. Really appalling Was happy to go hungry instead.
London to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Earlier flight cancelled long delay in airport. Booked window flights on cancelled flight and we have middle aisle seats now. Food on flight from Perth to Hong Kong was awful. Wont be flying Cathay Pacific again 5 star I dont think so.
I am a regular flyer but only had my first experience with SkyWest last week on a flight from Milwaukee to LaGuardia. Unfortunately I have to say it was the worst experience I have had with an airline. I booked the flight via Delta who did not include baggage in the ticket price and would not allow me to pay for this immediately I had to wait until it was time to check in. Very inconvenient. They then proceeded to rescheduled the time of the flight about four times. As a result I had to call them to reschedule to a later flight which resulted in my missing several hours of my NYC vacation. The later flight took off as scheduled but was very old and had the smallest seats I have ever seen and I am a small person. Safety is clearly not a priority for this airline as the flight attendants did not explain what to do in case of an emergency and by checking the safety card I discovered there were no life vests or life rafts on board. In the event of us landing on water we were to use the seat cushions to stay afloat Considering this flight crossed Lake Michigan and Lake Erie and flew over the Atlantic before landing at LaGuardia I find it baffling that they would even consider not having life vests on board.
The most horrible ground service They will lose your luggage and never take care of finding it. When I arrived to Ankara airport my luggage did not appeared on the belt and I then consulted to lost luggage desk. The guy working there told me that he can see my luggage is in Istanbul and they will send it to my address tomorrow. he even told me that they have received an email for my luggage already. The next day nothing happened and I called them. Quite surprisingly I found out that they know nothing about the luggage they even dont know in which country is my luggage at the moment meaning the THY assistant on the desk lied to me in a very professional way. I has been couple of days now and heard nothing. No one is contacted besides I then saw the report that the initial guy wrote the color of my luggage was written wrong and the flight number I took was completely wrong. I wish there would be better options then them so no one would feel they have no other choice.
Just returned today on trip from Boston to Asheville flight delayed Approx. 3 hours. On trip to Boston was delayed about 6 hours. Worse trip ever. Plane was old faux leather seats well worn. Plane was dirty food under seats. Weather was supposed to have problem on Friday no reason today. Pilot gave virtually nil flight information. Flight attendant making announcements could not be understood talk too low and fast. The plane noise was terrible seats popped and cracked. Never again.
The flight was smooth and service was great. I didnt take the food as I was had enjoyed lounge food prior to boarding. The entertainment system had new movies which I like even though its a short flight. I wish boarding was more organized where people boarded based on their rowszones because it can get chaotic.
Melbourne to London via Shanghai. Customer service Both customer service office in Melbourne and Sydney office were very helpful. Please note that the Melbourne office is only contactable by email never answers the phone If you want to speak to someone call the Sydney office. Crew Very professional in all flights. Thank you to them for making our flight an enjoyable experience. Time Keeping all four were flights arrived on time very unusual in my experience. PVG Terminal 1 DeparturesTransit Depending on your ticket class the airline offers a dining voucher selected places when having a long stop over in PVG 80RMBpp. This is enough to get you a decent bowl of noodles each at Hope Star Coffee Cafe. The info is on their website but difficult to find. See below for more transiting info. Check In PVG Many checkin desks open very quick and painless. CONS Food Poor even coming out of Shanghai. Turbulence At the first sign of turbulence the seat belt sign lights up and then stays on for the entire flight. This happened on all four flights. Everyone ends up ignoring it as a result. Website Hard to navigate and makes many errors Online Check In Pointless both in London and Shanghai no bag drop for online check in Only MEL. Check In LHR Very few check in desks open 1 hour to checkin. Boarding Passes When checking in online it asks you to print your boarding passes no point as they print it for you at the airport. Our computer could not find the font to print the boarding passes. Another occasion the website did not recognise our checkin. PVG Terminal 1 Arrivals cash machine did not work on our arrival. If this is the case you need to walk to terminal 2 to withdraw cash. PVG Terminal 1 DeparturesTransit Shops are generally quite poor and expensive and so to are the nearly all the restaurants. One cafe that stands out is Hope Star Coffee Cafe serves decent food nicely presented by far the best place to eat in Terminal 1. There is also two Starbucks one at each end of the terminal one has seats inside the other just takeaway. Depending on your ticket class or your time of stopover you could instead choose a maglev pass or a hotel room for a number of hours over the dining voucher. But the airline said we could not leave the airport with a 7hr stopover. When waiting to go through immigration and number of people we told they could not enter on their transit and we directed through to the transit area. If youre looking to stopover for a couple of days you can get a 144hr visa on arrival at no charge. This also allows you to visit selected provinces. The Bullet train makes it possible to do this. We visited friends in Nanjing on our return leg to Shanghai the train took 1hr 11mins to travel 290km costing around 35AUD one way.
Bologna to Johannesburg via Paris. The staff of air France are the most compassionate people Ive dealt with on an aircraft. They are focused on Customer comfort. I will recommend Air France.
In favour of the staff onboard the attitude was extremely friendly we got a biscuit together with some water and the cabin looked clean and crisp. What one can get on low cost airlines doesnt justify flying with many European full service airlines and that includes Air Dolomiti. The reason I took them was only the time schedule certainly not for flying premium as the experience was nothing else than the opposite.
Online checkin did not exist so I had to use the desk even without bags. Onboard experience was ok. The planes were very old B737500 with nonexistent legroom and An148 where legroom was ok. The crews were mature but welcoming. Their English skills are very basic and announcements were just incomprehensible. Overall ok but very much postSoviet style. All flights on schedule. For the price paid I could expect more civilised experience. I have never been able to accrue my Aeroflot Bonus miles on their flights despite them being a daughter business of Aeroflot. Overall very mediocre.
Nagasaki to Sydney via Tokyo Haneda on 12 October 2017. Both flights were excellent. Checkin process at Nagasaki was crowded but all passengers were checked in with ample time to spare. The seats on the plane were in a 343 configuration and there was a standard seat width. However the legroom was brilliant I was able to stretch my legs all the way and I am 63 192cm. Inflight service consisted of a drink and a small snack. Transfer in Tokyo was smooth and was also where I experienced firsthand how helpful ANA staff really are I realised I did not have my passport about 5 minutes before the plane was to board and the staff immediately leapt into action. Two began furiously calling on phones at the gate and three left to go looking around at all the places I had been in the airport. They even told me that they would delay the flight until it was found The passport was eventually handed in to the information desk at the airport and one of the staff then went to pick it up and delivered it to me. After this somewhat dramatic start to the second flight the rest of the journey was smooth The legroom was again impressive and the seats were comfortable enough for me to catch a few hours of sleep. I would highly recommend flying with ANA whenever you have the chance and they are probably the best choice for flying to Japan.
Flew Emirates from Doha to Colombo via DubaiMale. Pros Very nice and friendly cabin crew very quick in service. Excellent food availability compared to other airlines Ive traveled so far. Comfortable and spacious seats. Cons There were long queues at the airport airline could insist the airport authorities had more counters available a little delay in take off timing and had an awful experience at transit airport Male.
SilkAir is a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. It recently started a 4weekly service to Busan South Korea. The outbound flight is a red eye flight which arrived early the next morning. As it was a late night flight only drinks and snacks were served after take off. A simple breakfast was served before arriving into Busan. There is no personal inflight entertainment system on the B737800. Instead passengers have to stream movies and music over their personal devices via the SilkAir Studio app. The problem is that if you do not have earphones you wont be able to listen to the soundtrack. There is an overhead TV screen showing Korean comedy series. Nobody was paying attention to the TV as most passengers were asleep. I was seated in the exit row so the leg space was generous. However the same cannot be said of the other rows. Being a service to Korea there was a Korean flight attendant among the 4 serving the economy cabin. They were pleasant and efficient but somehow lacked the finesse of their counterparts in Singapore Airlines. SilkAir will be absorbed into its parent company Singapore Airlines in due course. It is in need of a rebranding and overhaul to its cabin product.
Ahmedabad to Los Angeles return via Dubai. An additional amount was paid after few days for pre selection of seats. The seat selection was changed thereafter. A web checkin for my return journey from Los Angeles was done on 12th June. After initial food selection of Vegetarian Hindu meal while purchasing the tickets on all 3 subsequent occasions the seat preselection change in seat and web check in the meal selection of Vegetarian Hindu meal was repeatedly confirmed. After boarding the flight the food offered to me was either ChickenLamb. On specifically asking for pre selected vegetarian meal I was told by the staff that my name was not on the vegetarian list at all and was asked to wait till meal was serving was over. I was never approached again for food vegetarian fruits bread or even cookies. The only food I was offered was a small Pizza then a breakfast which was eggsham.
I am flying London to Seattle in Business Class in May 2020 and British Airways wants around 100 each way for me to choose seats. All other airlines I have encountered allow Business Class passengers to choose seats at no additional cost. They decided to change my seat for operational reasonss. What could that reason be The plane is the same. So BA takes 100 off me for me so that I can choose my seat and then changes my seat without asking me. What I get is an automated message the next time I log on to the BA website to tell me. There is a number I can ring 40 minutes waiting for the phone to be answered and I give up.
I flew with China Eastern Airline from Sydney to Frankfurt with a stopover in Shanghai. Both flights were on time. Crew was nice in both flights they checked properly the safety things. Food was even alright. I can recommend the airline for the cheap price.
I had the worst experience from Sharjah to Trivandrum with Air India Express IX536 on 21122017. My flight was scheduled to be at 20.40 hrs from Sharjah but the departure was at 6.30 am next morning. But had a delay of 9 hours and 40 minutes. They keep on rescheduling and keep on sending text messages and were made to wait for flight. Overall I would say. This flight not at all suitable for emergency and well planned trips. Never fly with Air India Express youre never sure to arrive on time. This is completely unrespectful and not honest at all.
This flight was the worst I have ever experienced in my entire life my children were scared to death it was super late to board and fly out. The pilot gave no warning of an upcoming storm and while the flight attendants were out giving drinks the entire plane dropped several feet and the people on the plane screamed in fear. My baby woke up scared to death and my two other children yelled. They continued to fly in the storm instead of go around it and put us all in danger. Do not fly Allegiant.
Johannesburg to George. 2 hour delay old planes would not recommend. Poor communication from the airline. Will not use them again. Cheap in this case means cheap planes.
LHRTUN return to LHR. Aircraft was A320 on both legs a little old but well maintained. Cabin was tidy and the crew were smiling and responding to all demands. Pitch is ok and you are allowed to carry 20 kilos of luggage. We had a choice of 3 meals on a 2 hr 45 mins flight beer is on demand and you could take whatever you want. A good experience.
Ljubljana to Frankfurt. Flight delayed for more than 2 hours due to technical problems. We were not given any food or water and when I requested some I was told to complain to Adria Airways website. Another plane was organized more than 2 hrs later. The staff was trying to convince the passengers that their connection to Singapore will wait they had 15 min in between the new flight arrival time and departure and that the flight to Frankfurt is 1 hr and no wifi connectivity on flight
Our flight was cancelled due to COVID19 but we were never notified by the airline I only found out because I called before the flight to check on my flight status. They told us to contact the Websalesrefund email address requesting a refund but we have only received automated responses that are ambiguous such as We offer to keep your flight open. We believe that we are eligible for a refund however we have not received any clear guidance on if we can get a refund or how we can access credit. The call centre tells us to email and the email responses tell us to call. It has been almost two months and I dont know if we will ever get our money back. All the other airlines that we had bookings with in May and June such as Vueling Scoot and Easyjet have given us refunds. Oman is the only airline that has used tactics to confuse us and ignore us. Unless we are given assurance that we will receive our refund or credit I will never fly Oman Air and will not recommend it.
Our flight back to Athens on a different airline was very delayed causing us to miss our first flight home. I understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline. Whats worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets. The absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with and I will never be flying with them again.
Purchased flight tickets 5 weeks in advance with confirmed seats. Two days before flight seating assignment was changed. Have heard similar stories where seating was changed last minute from others traveling on JetBlue flights. This is a real problem for families traveling with children who need to sit together. Added stress my last 2 flights had issue with TV service. Problem with audio or not working at all. Tried to call JetBlue customer service 800 after landing. Twice spent 70 minutes on hold. Never actually able to speak with a service rep.
Chisenau was our layover stop between London and Krasnodar and our plane with Air Moldova was delayed for a substantial amount of time leaving us worried that we would miss our next flight. However we were able to board our plane to Krasnodar thanks to the staff at Air Moldova. Knowing that we along with a couple of other passengers were getting close to missing our next plane the cabin staff ensured that we were the first to disembark the plane. Once at the Chisenau airport staff took us directly to our next plane which would have taken us much longer if the kind staff had not taken us via the quickest route. Without them we would have definitely missed our flight.
Oslo to Miami via Paris. Were supposed to fly the day after the US initiated the travel ban from Europe. The checkin didnt work rescheduling didnt work and cancellation didnt work. I got the same errormessage each time asking me to contact customer service. Tried to call two days in a row but the Norwegian number didnt work. Tried to contact them on Facebook but the response I got was that I could check in my hand baggage for free. Still havent received any information regarding my flight and there is no way I can contact them.
Best things about Air N.Z. premium economy 2 checkin bags excellent food attentative and professional service. However my seat in front row felt cramped due to armrest having a traytable. The leather seats interior felt dated and worn. Bizarrely the aircon was so warmstuffy. The pilots were outstanding though.
This was the last flight in a One World around the world ticket. Buenos Aries to LHR a 13 hour flight. I really didnt have any complaints about this flight or BA but against the other 7 airlines in 3 months it was pretty average. The FAs were helpful the food was OK the only really bad thing was the AVOD. Half a dozen new releases and a dozen or so older films. Likewise the album selection pretty poor. The 777 was around 6 years old so maybe was due for an upgrade. To be fare Im comparing BA against Emirates so no contest really
Sofia to Singapore via Doha. Hit or miss it with the crew. SOFDOH in a A321 with recliner business seats in 22 configuration for a 5 hour flight a comfortable option. Crew just fantastic and make everything possible great job Food as always very good drink list very decent although Pommery Brut is not my favorite Champagne. Only negative on this leg was the not at all responsive touch screen of the entertainment system. Second leg in a fabulous A3501000 such a roomy aircraft quiet and featuring the famous QSuite the best business class seat I have ever flown. Especially the enormous screen is really impressive Just three restrooms for a very large business cabin somehow did not seem right at all. But although very proactive the crew was providing a very slow service forgot to serve my ordered wines had to be asked 23 times before it was brought to the seat. Never experienced such a service flying with Qatar Airways so far.
This was an unexpected surprise due to my family thinking that we were going to fly Ryanair however in my opinion it was a pleasant surprise. I have a really bad fear of flying so an incredibly nice cabin crew member sat next to me and told me that she loved flying and how long she had done it for and how safe it was. She also said that she really enjoyed flying and the turbulence was enjoyable. The seats were nice and the crew was amazing. I didnt get any food but I loved this low cost airline.
Flew St Petersburg to Moscow via New Delhi. The flight was stalled for 2 hours without any announcements. Half the cabin crew failed to give any substantial reason. After 2 hours we were told to deboard as the flight is delayed for another hour because of a passenger who failed to board and his luggage was onboard. After creating an utter chaos of 15 minutes with people standing and removing cabin bags another announcement was made that now the flight was ready to take off. There was absolutely no reason as to what was happening. I understand there is a reasonable language barrier but for an international carrier it is unacceptable. Will never recommend Aeroflot.
Singapore to Bandung. I call SlikAir premiumlowfare because my base is in South East Asia so my choice is SilkAir rather than AirAsia for low cost. The service is quite good seat comfort is standard the entertaiment is accesible on your own device and they served food too. The cabin crew also nice.
We expected to arrive in Dubai by 0015 and board our onward flight to Kuwait by 0145. Our flight was expected to leave at 1415 from London Heathrow on 31st march but departed at 1520. We expressed concerns to the staff in London and were assured that we would not miss our connecting flight. Onboard the flight the crew said they could not be certain if we will make the flight as it depends which Gate etc the flight would be on. This left us confused and apprehensive for the rest of our flight. As we arrived in Dubai at 0100 we were met by a Emirate representative who said we had already been offloaded the flight and had us booked on the next flight at 0745 the next morning. They gave us a meal voucher and said that is the best they could do. The staff said because of immigration rules they cannot offer anything to passengers if it is less than 8 hours. There was no empathy and I do not blame the staff from connections to the lounges we spoke to as they kept referring there are no managers on duty who are empowered to authorize a place to rest and this is standard policy for missed flights arising due to delays. We chose this flight due to the short connection. If we wanted a longer layover we would have booked it but timing was important to us. We truly experienced a journey in a class of its own.
On 13th July 2023 I traveled with Turkish Airlines from Delhi to Stockholm via Istanbul. I missed the connecting flight and Turkish Airlines made me pay for putting us on the next flight. The staff for Turkish Airlines at the customer service desk were rude to me. I had 1 hr 10 mins to make it to my connection. The plane arrived 10 minutes late we were ferried to the airport terminal on buses and there was a security queue for transfers. Then the walk to the other side of the airport led to missed connection and the customer service desk asked me ludicrous amount to put on the next flight. Overall flight services and cabin crew are nice but the ground staff and systems for Turkish Airlines is designed to be exploitative.
I will never fly them again I booked a flight from Las Vegas to Honolulu and I booked a flight with a different airlines to get from Honolulu to Australia. Right before departure they said that something is wrong with the engine and we have to wait to fix it. They took almost 2 hours and I didnt see anyone fixing anything Due to this I missed my flight to Australia because of the time of landing I basically lost around 2500 because I had book another ticket to Australia and also book a hotel room plus food for that night I was trying to talk to the staff for more than 3 hours at the airport and they kept sending here and there without any solution The service is so bad they dont care if you are satisfied or not.
I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation.
London Heathrow to Dubai. Last Sunday we unfortunately missed our BA flight to Dubai due to unforeseen circumstances so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with Emirates. Today we arrived at Dubai airport expecting to board the flight home that we had already paid for months in advance. At check in the BA staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight. We have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought.
Ho Chi Minh city to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Wow there really is I discovered not a great deal of consistency with SQ apart from the service routine. HCMC to Singapore I had the best meal on a flight ever. Tender pork in gravy with thin sliced fried potato and onion. Was so good. The entertainment was appalling in that the screen was too dark to even see even with lighting altered and the screen tilted blinds down. Anyway we got there safely and being just a 2 hr flight it was fine. Leaving Singapore on SQ 227 at 9.20pm. Full flight. Going through security at the gate itself. Boarded in sections but no one abided by that and they were not enforced which makes for a shambles. Paid for exit row seats. Nowhere to store anything. My husband tried to find an overhead locker but the lady in the aisle two seats down refused to share. Her carry on was horizontal in it and she had another small bag. Got upset when my husband tried to put her bag vertical. Was ignored by FAs. Found somewhere finally but if you do go for the exit row you will be last off as you cant get back to where your bag is. Nowhere for my handbag. I got it stuffed under my own seat via the front. There was a baby in the infant seats but was really good very attentive parents I was impressed. Singapore has got the meal service wrong here too. At 9.20pm you are faced with a proper dinner which a snack would suffice as most have had dinner by then. Breakfast was a roll muffin and a little bit of fruit. After having such a great experience on the initial trip I felt let down. Still quite good but I felt I could have been with any other airline. I wish there was more consistency. I would still opt for them though at least outbound.
Arrived early LAX and wanted to fly standby on earlier flight. Alaska charges 50 to do this. Its free on United. I needed to text Alaska for help because gate and terminal was not on my boarding i formation and after waiting for 6 or 7 minutes for Nikki she didnt give me a chance to text an answer and ended the chat. Customer service is not Alaskas forte. I recommend Delta or United.
I was happy with the four Air Namibia flights of this trip FrankfurtWindhoek WindhoekCape Town and back. Plenty of food and drinks only one minor delay everyone was nice and the price was great. However at Cape Town Airport the checkin for the flight back opened way too late. There wasnt enough time to pass all the necessary security check and passport control queues. When we had to ask for airport employee help at the passport control queue they were rude and said it wasnt their problem but the airlines. This caused delays at both Cape Town and Windhoek and we almost missed the connection. Frequent travellers said this was a common problem on Fridays should have been addressed by now. Also the website doesnt have a filter for visas required to enter the destination.
Vancouver to Bejing. When we arrived in Beijing we had a 8 hour stopover. We toured the Airport and arrived back at our gate about 1 hour before departure. We heard a Chinese Announcement about flight to Manila and repeated by a very bad English. When we approached our gate about 3 mins later than boarding we were informed we missed the flight. The plane had not left terminal.
Guwahati to Delhi. We get it its a budget airline. But if the flight is getting delayed then you should let the passengers know about the delay beforehand and not 1 hour before the flight.
Insel Air has to be the worst airline. Our bad experience started when we traveled from Miami to Aruba when our flight was delayed 7 hours when we arrived to Aruba it was 100 am and had to pay 70 for a cab because the car rental place was closed. Then on our return flight on December 30th it was again delayed for 2 hours then when we finally took flight the airplane was returned to Aruba due to another malfunction then we stayed in the airport another 8 hours and lost our connecting flights in Miami the airline is using old airplanes from the 70s and 80s with visual wear and tear. The attendants at the airport are clueless to say the least all the said was I dont know. I really regret saving 180 per ticket compared to American Airlines for the same route. I guess that you get what you pay for. I someone ever thinks to flight to Aruba or Curacao think twice before you use this lame and awful airline.
BA 059 London to Cape Town April 29 2014 economy. Its been a while since I flew BA world traveller and it will be even longer until I use them again. Clapped out 747 terrible uncomfortable seats awful back of seat video system. my partners failed. The crew seemed totally disinterested and disengaged and far more interested in getting the service note the quotes over with ASAP. all they wanted to do was to retreat behind the curtain and gossip. Perfunctory drinks service when asking for a whisky and soda I was offered whisky and tonic. Paper cups for coffee at breakfast. Meals are better at a Little Chef. The amenity kit was an ancient set of headphones and a toothbrush. Never again. Wake up BA there are major competitors out there and next time it Emirates via Dubai.
Denpasar to Tunis via Doha. The flight from Denpasar to Doha was unsatisfactory. The seats were uncomfortable screens old my food was terrible. Staff was not responsive very slow. The connection Doha Tunis was delayed by 4 hours. They just gave us a breakfast voucher. Very different explanation of the delay from ground staff who from my point of view did not take care at all of the customer. The only thing I know is that I was super tired and that I wasnt expecting this. When I asked about a refund for the delay at least the tax cost they replied in an unpleasant way that it is not possible.
The large upstairs business class on the A380 is often relatively empty on the Bangkok to Hong Kong route route but on this short 2day round trip both sectors were virtually full. Only the excellent bar at the back seemed to attract just a few passengers. The privacy in the window seats is superb the large IFE screens make those of some airlines seem small in comparison and a very extensive IFE programming. FAs go about their business calmly and flat bed seats are popular with some passengers who prefer to nap than partake of the meal service. With Emirates ticket prices for business class vastly cheaper than any other airline this flight is quite literally a steal
I expected the worst due to reviews on here but was pleasantly surprised with Air Europa. Check in was done through my phone the night before the flight boarding was a breeze the flight itself was completely packed. Crew were pretty straight forward and courteous. No free drinks onboard but i managed to buy some OJ for 3 Euros. My ticket included a carry on item plus my backpack. Glad to have chosen Air Europa for this flight. Inflight entertainment was turned on for the full flight.
I have flown with Air Malta countless times in the past years. I can say with all honesty that the airline has proven to become worse and worse every year. The evidence is not only in the small leg space available but the atrocious meal provided. A 4 hour flight to Moscow and only a sandwich and a bottle of water. Its abysmal. Air Malta used to provide hot meals with a choice of water juices and soft drinks and afterwards a cup of tea or coffee. What happened to this airline I am sorry to say but nothing about it makes me want to use the service again. A note to the airline It would be a good suggestion to pay just a little bit more for the flight and it would have a decent meal included.
Glasgow to Miami via London. Glasgow to Heathrow was painless as was transfer to t3. Heathrow to Miami on aging 747. Flight delayed by an hour due to temperatures on board being unsafe to board. Kept informed by gate team about progress. TV screen tiny and poor choices of entertainment. Plane was looking its age and a bit run down around the edges. Premium economy offering in cabin and seat comfort far superior on A380. What made this journey very good was the young lady looking after the premium economy cabin. Polite efficient welcoming and nothing was any bother for her. Service with a smile from start to finish . People in here quick to criticise poor service so big shout out to this crew member for doing a great job. Also meals and drink selection very good. Although leaving an hour late we arrived in time so overall job well done BA and looking forward to return journey.
Singapore Airlines is dropping their lead over other airlines. While service is still consistent as it was for many years nothing has changed and the food is everytime getting worse. I have flown Singapore Airlines in last 2 months a few times and the main courses offered I could not eat them and left them. No question asked of course. Being the most expensive and for long time leading they better watch or they will soon have tough competition.
Heads up for anyone planning travel in the Greek Islands. After visiting 3 Greek islands our last stop was Athens flying from Naxos to Athens on Olympic Air. Short flight very convenient and reasonably priced compared to Ferry option. Unfortunately when arriving in Athens no bags. This is a typical practice by Olympic as the small planes quickly are over weight limits and if you are unlucky no bags when you arrive. In our case the bags are being put on the Ferry and will arrive 3 days later. Not a great situation when on holiday. Strongly encourage folks to think about this risk when taking these short flights between the islands.
Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo via Singapore. It was my first time taking SIA and was not a memorable one. The inflight service is nothing to shout out about. Seating comfort is average. Cabin crews were not that warm they are just doing their job. The inflight entertainment is soso. Nonenglish movies come without English subtitle. My biggest frustration is the quality of food. I am Muslim and preordered the Muslim special meal. On SINHND route as we flew at night and it was midlong haul we were given snack around 2 hours after departure. I was just served a piece of cake while the others got a sandwich. However the crew was kind enough to offer me a vege sandwich. While flight en route HNDSIN was more surprising. I got on board around 9.15am and we had lunch served around 4.5 hour after departure without being served snack. They offered us peanuts and juice 2 hours after departure. All in all I do not find SIA is accommodating enough but they offer good price for the ticket.
Given what other travelers suffered this same month I suppose we didnt have it nearly as badly it was just a bare bones airline that nickel dimed you for everything from soda onboard to an added 25 fee per carryon luggage. First we paid 50 for upgraded seats which unless you are very tall dont bother. You dont get priority boarding as promised they boarded people with children or those who need more time first and apparently more than half the plane thought this was them. At that point the rest of the passengers lined up to board. This is not how other airlines manage boarding they use zones. The same thing happened on the return flight so again not worth the upgrade. There is no inflight entertainment at all we had to pay to upload movies onto our laptop the food onboard is sparse and of low quality it costs for even basic soda and drinks were pricier than Air Canada. Priority luggage is not a thing and Im furious we paid for it our luggage came off next to last and not together. The same thing happened on the way home. Our transfer from the hotel to the airport home never arrived despite our hotel calling and texting them. We ended up paying 96USD for a cab and at the airport we heard the same situation happened for many other travellers who had to scramble and pay for their own rides. Sunwing didnt answer anyone who tried to reach out to inquire about where the transfers were and so far no one has responded to us about being refunded our cab fee. The airport was full of people who had no idea if their flights to get them were even coming and this is because Sunwing is not updating anyone including the incoming airports. Even FlightAware wasnt updating I had to go to the actual live radar app to find out if flights were coming which means the airline itself has no clue where any of its aircraft are. So many angry frustrated passengers and it made for complete chaos in the Cancun airport especially since all of the Sunwing flights fly out of the tiny basement area and not the spacious main area up top. This is the second time Ive flown with Sunwing and the last time they lost our luggage on a direct flight despite us getting to the airport 3 hrs early We spent 24hrs without luggage. I dont care how much more it costs to use a competitor we are never flying with Sunwing again.
We traveled from Ft Lauderdale Florida to Oslo December 2122 Absolutely loved the airline great flight all the employees were super. My luggage was lost but was delivered to me in Sweden Christmas Eve which was 3 hours away from Oslo Airport. Cant say that about Southwest which is the airline we were supposed to get back to Arkansas the 29th.
Chengdu to Singapore. Absolutely the worst business class seat I have experienced. The width of the 2x2 first 3 rows is acceptable but the legroom is absolutely appalling less even than I would expect in a normal premium economy seat. Plus limited recline circa 30 degrees from vertical upon which when the person in the seat in front of you is reclined you have even less space to maneuver in and out and are pretty much forced to recline yourself to retain a semblance of spacing. Added to which the seat controls for recline footrest lumber massage are really stiff mechanical levers. For a brand new plane absolutely abysmal There is no in flight entertainment in the seat backs. In business one is issued with an iPad which can stream movies etc. through the Silk Air WiFi. This does not support Internet connectivity only the IFE. If you want to use your own device you need to have previously installed the Silk Air app from the app store something nobody tells you before you board. In the cramped seat space there is very little place to put the iPad even on the little plastic prop available on request so one ends up holding it whilst also trying to juggle a meal or whatever. No noise cancelling headphones just cheap inear buds so I plugged my own noise cancellers in to the iPad. No capability to connect via Bluetooth of course. I found it impossible to doze on the 4.5 hours midnight flight so tried to pass the time with the limited selection of English language films on the iPad. Literally the only redeeming feature of the whole miserable experience was the cabin crew who try their best to give high quality and attentive service. I feel sorry for them having to pretend that they represent a proper business class operation which this manifestly is not.
Staff were slow in response but friendly. The frustrating thing is that no one checked the hand luggage sizes. They were well over 7Kg and some customers had more bags then the one. The overhead lockers were very full. This meant I had to store my cabin bag weight 5Kg 8 rows away. Almost impossible to get to once we had landed and people were standing up. If you are going to police the weight of luggage be consistent.
These guys nearly spoilt our trip. On arrival in Joburg we were to board Rwanda Air to Kigali. There were no signs of any check in counters. So after an hour of rushing between terminals we finally contacted someone at Rwanda Air who had said the flight was cancelled. He was not even apologetic for not telling us beforehand. I would be very careful if booking with them.
I had booked my ticket from Nairobi to Athens via Addis Ababa and the airline cancelled my scheduled flight due to COVID. When the airline resumed flights and I went to change my ticket I was informed that the price had gone up to double in fact and even though it was a ticket I had already paid for I had to pay for it again. 24 hours before departure I tried to check in online but only the first part of my flight was available for check in. When I arrived at the airport ET had cancelled my flight from Addis to Athens without notifying me and had also booked me to fly 24 hours later meaning I had to spend a day in Addis and arrive to my destination with 36 hours delay. The only way for me to reach my destination on the day i had planned which was important was to fly via Rome adding 9 hours to my trip and a lot more risk of contracting COVID as i had to wait for hours at the airport and later fly with a plane that for some reason was crowded in the front half while the second half remained empty. My trip lasted a total of 21 hours and cost 1100. My husband flew a day later with Lufthansa and was there 12 hours later having paid 600. when I complained about this and requested to be refunded the difference I paid someone replied Please kindly note that whenever schedule change or routing change occur we understand as our passengers plan may be disrupted but sometimes such decisions are necessitated due to operational or unforeseen circumstances. After having flown with this airline a few times I have come to the conclusion that its ok to fly with them if if everything goes smoothly but if something goes wrong and you need assistance and customer service they become the worst.
My group of friends and I were traveling from Jakarta to Los Angeles via Hong Kong and have with us premium economy tickets. We checked in at Jakarta separately. One of us received a surprise upgrade for the flight leg HKLAX. It was a pleasant surprise and great start for the start of the trip for her. As friends all of us were happy of her but a tad bit jealous of her luck. So while transiting in HK I decided to ask the lady at boarding counter if there are any possibilities of getting free upgrade and the remaining 3 of us were given the same upgrade to business class as well. CX has won our hearts. On the return flight we sat on the premium economy seats and the seat was comfortable wide and the leg space is abundant. Service was awesome the staff was very polite and helpful throughout the flight.
Paris to Chennai. I asked if they can upgrade to business class and the amount. They said it would be 625. After thinking I said yes. But by then they started take off procedures and later the air hostess came and said that they didnt do it because of paper work. I was really frustrated as I was willing to pay to get the upgrade.
Toronto to Cayo Coco. I will never fly with Cubana Airlines again because of them our trip was cut short by one day we were supposed to be in Cayo Coco at 1000 am on April 10th but because the flight was cancelled we didnt get there until 4 am on April 11th. When we got to the airport we had no idea the flight was cancelled until an hour after boarding was supposed to start they told us the flight didnt show up then we were told there was no crew members available and the third and final excuse was that 3 birds flew into the aircraft causing the cancellation we all had to either go home or stay at the hotel since the flight was supposed to leave the next day at 6 am we were about to leave the hotel to go shopping when we found out that the flight was actually going to leave the same night thanks for letting us know if it werent for the people that were notified by trip advisor we would have missed the flight. We were all given vouchers for breakfast lunch and dinner guess what we had to pay an extra 70 to eat at the hotel it was ridiculous. Once we finally got on the airplane the seats were dirty and the crew members pretty rude. Overall a horrible experience
This is my second time flying with Qatar Airways since 2015. The trip from Kuala Lumpur to London via Doha was great I received my preferred seat which was the very rear seat. The seats are rather comfortable despite it was almost full for the first half of the journey the foods they serve are tasty and rather fine for the economy class. Entertainment system worked fine and the programs were updated. The cabin crew responded anything I needed very quick and even though I did not sleep I cant sleep on plane ever the whole journey was rather comfortable and I arrive London with a positive happy mood. I guess the only downfall is the wifi connection are not working all the journey.
This airline is shambolic. Our direct flight from Paris to Dzaoudzi was cancelled and another given after 3hours but via Reunion. On arrival in Reunion shoved in my face a letter of apology. Agents very stand offish. Nothing offered not even water. Crying babies elderly customers not taken care of. Just herded like cattle to a small gate area. On embarking from Reunion to Dzaoudzi our baggage could be seen on tarmac but not loaded. Advised Purser and Captain but they shrugged shoulders. On arrival in RUN a total of 8 hours late with no luggage. On return flight to Paris CDG we were advised maybe a stop in East Africa then told once on plane going direct. Served a freezing cold salad as an entree and thats all. A dry baby croissant for breakfast but were made to feel grateful. We pay for service and products but must be grateful for something I contacted Air Austral under EU LAW 2612004 for my refund as laid out under EU Legislation after 17 emails ignoring me I contacted a third party attorney. Sure enough they are paying up my refund. I can only say this airline is awful. They hold you to ransom after you pay your hard earned money treat you like you are doing them a favour glare at you when questioned ignore the law they are contractually bound to serve you cold salad for dinner lose your luggage contact you after 6 months once summoned by a lawyer tell you where they are taking you with no chance to deplane if you need to change your plan. The situation is their Boeing 787 has many technical problems the Boeing 777 is too big to land in Mayotte so instead of being truthful they just lie. Still they are supposedly 3star
This airline is the worst all flights were delayed for about 3 hours and also Eunice one the airlines desk helper in Mexico DF was disrespectful and rude she also said that she had the power to stop us to take our flight back to USA. I will never use Interjet again.
2 recent flights LHR to SFO 12 hrs 7th Sept then San Diego to LHR 9 hrs 21st Sept BA 272. Club World cabin. Wife and I have flown business class on Singapore Air New Zealand Emirates Air Malaysia and Virgin on 20 occasions to New Zealand by various routes so we are familiar with the service provided at this level by other airlines. BA in our opinion doesnt come close. Briefly being charged 284 extra to reserve seats how do they get away with it Personally we felt uncomfortable with the backtofront seat layout too enclosed and awkward to get out of we were in the inner cell and I would imagine irritating for the outside passengers as well to have people clambering over their legs. Details hot towels threadbare scraps of cloth that were stone cold in under ten seconds and then only one and nothing for morning wakeup cheap looking menus lukewarm tea and coffee thrust over the barrier in mugs a sudden rattle as the screen was lowered and a basket of bread rolls thrust under your nose having to reach out sideways to receive meals embarrassment at disturbing the outside passenger trays passed over them minute napkins expect paper sheets anytime soon cabin crew just doing their job walking up and down the aisles at great speeds so as to avoid being asked for something cold soggy croissants which are an insult to croissants and dont get me started about the bacon roll We were offered a drink before dinner and had to ask for a topup one glass of wine with dinner dry tough steak and a refill after we had finished eating no after dinner drinks were offered. Lights outsee you in the morning I could go on but suffice to say we are so disappointed that our national airline could be so far behind the others.
Boston to London Heathrow was excited to experience A380 for the first time. Paid a steep 91 for the seat selection on the upper deck. Was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the Window. Seat itself was the standard one comfortable. The boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. The inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. The food was very mediocre at best not worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the way midflight. The A380 being so massive easily absorbed it. Return was on a B777 flight was not full but almost full. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The baggage drop area however was a disaster. None of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. The boarding was again very orderly. Both outbound and inbound IFE was good but not as good as some long haul carriers. If both legs had similar cabin crew and food I would have scored them higher.
Never try this airline. Akasa Air ground staff and customer support is not good. No one can help in airport. My life bad experience in this airline. Everyone just blamed to other..no one help. I have no words for this airline how can describe my problem here. It almost three months completed but at the moment no one help me.
Hong Kong to Seoul. It was a very smooth flight with no delays. Check in and boarding was smooth. The seat was equipped with a USB plug and a personal TV. Flight attendants were friendly and offered a special meal which I ordered before boarding. However the meal was quite tiny and no main course was served during the flight. They should provide more meal options.
I have to agree with previous reviewers that this is absolutely the worst airline I have ever dealt with. No idea how they are able to stay in business. I purchased the ticket for my friend from Buenos Aires to Cancun roundtrip. Her flight was supposed to be yesterday afternoon. They sent her an email in the morning saying that her flight was cancelled until today. You are not able to call to talk to a human they only use texts. During the texting they informed her that because her flight was cancelled that she would have to contact the third party that I purchased the ticket from to arrange the second leg of her flight from Lima to Buenos Aires. She called them Travelgenio and they told her they had nothing to do with it. Now shes at the airport in Cancun and theyre telling her in person that Travelgenio changed her flight not them. Theyre refusing to look at the email that Sky sent her. If she gets to Lima theyre telling her shell have to layover for 26 hours Shes going to miss out on work and a family gathering. And no fault of hers or mine whatsoever. Its a complete nightmare and communication break down. Stay away from Sky You have been warned
Eindhoven to Heraklion. Our flight from Heraklion was delayed by 6 hours due to a technical problem with the computer. Transavia promised us to compensate us within 2 weeks after filing a compensation report so thats great Flight was OK legroom was poor but cabin crew were very good. Also the sandwich I bought was good and for 4 euros well priced.
British Airways standards have dropped dramatically. My flight from Heathrow to New York JFK was awful. Passengers were not given a hand towel or a menu before the dinner service. I was only given one choice of meal. The interior of the aircraft looked worn and shoddy there was litter on the ground when entering the aircraft with the onboard entertainment system on the aircraft outdated to say the least there were limited choices available and the screen which was scratched kept flickering throughout the flight. Even the blanket and pillow looked as though it had had too many washes. The exterior of the aircraft was also dirty and unkept. Staff on board appeared far from athletic. British Airways are falling far behind the level of service provided by the top tier Far East and Middle Eastern airlines. Not impressed at all.
Berlin to London. What an embarrassment Our national carrier has become a laughing stock. German passengers with us were amazed that all items of refreshment had to be purchased. Each transaction took a long while being paid by card. Two elderly male flight attendants were barely able to service a full flight within the time available. The refreshments on offer were limited. British Airways used to epitomise service and quality it is now just like any other cheap carrier.
Manila to Tokyo with Jetstar Japan. Our scheduled flight was cancelled on the spot due to a crew member getting sick. It was a poorly managed situation as all of us passengers have already checkedin and we were simply made to wait by Jetstar to be transported to a hotel without any assurance or given timeline of when the next flight will be. The notification of the cancelled flight was made way past the time of departure. We tried to coordinate through hotline even speaking with an agent for more than an hour and to no avail they didnt have any idea what plans have been set out for us who needed to be in Tokyo as we had prepaid arrangements and plans. This left us with no choice but to book to another airline for a hefty price as Jetstar cannot finalize a decision that morning. Tokyo to Manila both our baggage were left in the return flight because the plane was overloaded. We prepaid our checkin baggage of 20 kg each person months before and only checked in less than that only 15kg which makes me wonder why Jetstar didnt even foresee the load the plane had to carry. We were only informed that some baggage were left when we were waiting at the pick up area in Manila airport and both our names werent even included in the list. Which we cant even confirm right then and there whether our baggage was still in Narita or not. We were simply left in line to wait to process our lost baggage claim late in the night. I think its certainly unfair for you to treat us without any feeling of assurance and blatantly just expect us to be fine that our baggage was left. As I called in the morning to followup on the status of our luggage I do not understand why their staff cant simply update us regarding the status of our report. Up to this moment no Jetstar representative has called text messaged nor sent an email regarding this matter. I had to call numerous times before finding out that my luggage was on its way via JAL flight tonight but my sisters luggage which we checked in at the same time has no confirmed flight back yet.
I fly with Turkish often as it is the only airline my company will validate tickets through and every time I fly with them I remember why I prefer Qatar Airways significantly more. This last flight though was my absolute last straw and I am never flying with them again. I paid 39USD to be able to pick my seat on a two hour flight. When I got to my seat there was a family sitting there and they straight up told me to find another seat. I picked the middle of the plane 18C and I picked an aisle seat specifically so I could get back and forth to the bathroom because unfortunately I am THAT person. I ended up extremely sick and nauseous during the flight and I had to run to the back of the plane for the entire duration of the flight. Flight attendant laughed at me only help I got was from the two people sitting in my new row. Only way I can describe this is absolutely trashy and messy service from Turkish Airlines in Turkey. Yes its only 39USD but I paid extra for my seat and it isnt even about that its the fact that everybody expected me to give up a seat that I paid for They didnt plan ahead and book seats all together and that was never my fault.
Yangon to Thandwe and pleasantly surprised by Air KBZ. Snacks served onboard seats generally comfortable. Organisational issues with boarding and a slight delay in departure from Yangon. Check in at RGN was not very organised however once inside the departure terminal ground staff were more helpful. They give you a coloured sticker to put on your shirt to ensure you get on the correct flight. Would use again.
Jogjakarta to Amsterdam via Singapore. Good aircraft and amazing cabin crew service. I got a special assistant because I flew myself carrying 1 baby aged 6 months and 1 child aged 4 years. it was amazing for me to feel service in the air that I had never received before. While I was carrying a baby there was a cabin crew coming to calm down my daughter with earplugs. Then came the cabin crew carrying candy and feeding my child. then came the cabin crew again carrying cookies and finally there was another cabin crew carrying some pillows and putting them on my childs back. Thanks for that amazing service.
I booked a return flight on Turkish Airline from New Delhi to Geneva and then Rome to New Delhi. The last leg of the journey was horrible It was operated by Turkish codeshare partner Indigo. I fail to understand how can a full service carrier like Turkish make its customers travel on a low cost airline. We had to pay for water no inflight entertainment and no hot meals only sandwiches that too only what was available with them.
Flew from Cambridge to Dublin. Outbound was great. However when I went to check in for return flight from Dublin I was greeted with You know this flight has been cancelled dont you When I pointed out that the flight was still showing on departure board I found out it had only been cancelled within the last 15 minutes. We were put on flight to London City and then transferred by cab to Cambridge. 3 hours late. Cityjet have so far not responded to my request for a callback. I received an email thanking me for my detailed comments which I havent sent and thanking me for my feedback which again I never provided. Pity really because I would have recommended Cityjet were it not for the appalling customer service.
Heathrow Mexico and Cancun Gatwick in economy. Entertainment fine food ok spacious seats nice crew and excellent landing. I shall fly again with BA.
Domestic flight was ok only slightly delayed. International flight from Rome to Buenos Aires was some 30 minutes late. Entertainment was working perfectly but only one recent movie was available the same of the flight I had taken more than 20 days earlier to Rome. Staff was nice and generally willing to help. However the food was simply awful. I travelled with my wife who asked the lowsalt option so we had the opportunity to taste two different menus. Both were very poor clearly the worst we have ever tasted on a flight which is even more surprising given the quality of food in Italy the country that this airlines is supposed to represent. Wifi did not work.
My recent experience with Turkish Airlines was marred by unprofessional behavior from a cabin crew member inadequate customer service and a lack of timely and satisfactory resolution. I hope that by sharing my experience the airline will recognize the importance of addressing such issues promptly and appropriately. I would strongly reconsider choosing Turkish Airlines for my future travels as customer satisfaction and respectful treatment should always be a top priority.
Citilink from Kupang to Surabaya on an Airbus A320. Checkin was quick and smooth. The boarding process was fast and I was greeted by friendly cabin crew. The flight departed a bit late but arrive on time. The seat was quite comfortable for me. Overall I always enjoyed fly with Citilink and will consider to fly with them again. I think Citilink is now the best LCC in Indonesia.
Singapore Airlines is by far the best airline I have flown it. The cabin is a spacious 333 layout in its Economy Class with excellent mood lighting. The cabins lack individual air vents and can make it uncomfortable sometimes. Food was average and the portions were not great. However the cabin crew do everything from serving snacks like sandwiches cup ramen chips cookies etc. to the passengers from time to time with water and beverages. Hospitality was fivestar. From the welcome at the door the crew help out passengers with a smile. Given that they work for hours together on some ultralong haul flights and with a wide of array of passengers onboard it is amazing to see them help you with a smile always. In seat entertainment had a lot of options and can easily entertain any person young or old on a 17 hour flight. In all the experience was great and I would recommend SQ to everyone.
This was my first time on a long haul flight with British Airways. I found the seats to be very comfortable until a woman in front pushed her seat right back so then the video screen was almost in my face. She refused to put it back when we asked politely. She got out of her seat and stood on my foot which had been recovering from a broken bone then laughed with her friend. I detected she could cause trouble so decided it was time to move. I explained to the air hostess who immediately accommodated us. She came back a few minutes later to ask if I would like tea and if all was ok. She also brought a colleague with her. I found the staff to be ultra helpful and pleasant. The food was good quality for economy. Previously I would have flown Air Canada but I think British Airways are a better quality airline. I would have no hesitation in recommending British Airways.
Sydney to Singapore. We flew Scoot Airlines Scoot Plus cabin. This used to be called Scoot Biz but they changed it because of too many complaints that it was nowhere near business class. It is really a Premium Economy product at a budget price. You also get designated check in priority boarding and disembarkation. There are negative reviews of the Scoot Biz or Scoot Plus product. You get what you pay for. The ticket price if you are doing a return trip is not much more than economy on full service airlines and much less than any premium economy tickets. The seats are fabulous 20 inches wide with 38 inches leg room and 6 inches recline just like most premium economy airlines. However you need to bring your own entertainment or device and can purchase extra wifi. You get one meal and drink on this 7 hour flight. Sadly the food is not great. This is the downside. It is what we would call TV dinner standard and portion size. You can bring your own snacks no problem but have to purchase their drinks. Overall highly recommended over any economy or premium economy product except for the food.
Overall PLAY assistance and customer service was very poor. In Boston the assistance at the Boarding Gate was unprofessional. PLAY needed to arrive earlier. They needed to announce what the expectations more clearly before all the confusion began. Passengers who did not have a red tag on their personal item and carryon needed to bring them up to the desk. Then people were charged 90 for bags that they normally can bring on other airlines as a carryon. The PLAY personnel kept leaving the desk. Passenger became anxious and kept cutting in line to be the next person served. No orderly process. Getting a boarding pass on MyPlay was extremely difficult. Several people asked us if we had as much trouble as they did. The site would need to be accessed several times. It finally worked for the trip from Boston to Keflavik but not visa versa. I was confused when it asked if I had a check in bag etc. I paid for it already. Fortunately I was able to go back on the site and confirm my bag status. The boarding pass final step didnt provide a pass. A popup was shown but I didnt get to read it. One person should have been available at the PLAY desk in Keflavik. We were not even sure it was the service desk until security helped us. People want to move on and get through security. Also at Keflavik we took a bus to the airplane. The priority people didnt get bused separately so they were just mixed in with the crowd entering the plane. Again unorganized. In general the other parts of the trip were good. We left on time and arrived early. The plane staffs was good and Icelandic staff. The checked bags arrived quickly.
An absolutely disgusting airline I booked a flight with them and they cancelled it for absolutely no reason at all. They emailed me that it was cancelled and that I could reschedule my flight using their customer support service or a nearby Egyptair office. The customer support service never answered and left me hanging for so long that my call credits ran out and there is no Egyptair office close to where I live. Terrible experience and a terrible company.
Flew last week from Vienna to Sofia in Economy and was a lot more satisfied than last time the aircraft was cleaner and better maintained cabin crew were a lot more attentive and the catering has slightly improved the sandwich accompanied by the chocolate. Ontime departure and landing. The cost of a oneway ticket was 130 which I found perfect The plane was fully booked in Economy whereas Business class was almost empty.
Karachi to Tehran Tehran to Mashhad and then Tehran to Damascus and Damascus to Tbriz trbriz to Tehran and from Tehran to Karachi. On international routes service was quite good food is hot and good quantity while the domestic routes the food is not hot nor tasty. Service at airport was good but there is a room for improvement. Cabin staff friendly helpful. Flights were usually on time the planes were old Russian on domestic routes that were so uncomfortable.
Nice flight with Saudia. First fly from Paris to Jakarta via Jeddah. Everything on time. No problem with our suitcase. Jeddah airport is clean but no WIFI available. People working in the flight were nice. The screen to watch movie was old and not working. For the return we arrived only 35min late in Paris. 2nd flight was nice. I would recommend Saudia Airlines. Good pricequality.
As always great new planes friendly service lots of legroom. On time every time staff extremely helpful and even in economy food very good. We will always where possible fly Singapore Airlines. Thank you you are a big part of our holidays.
London to Mauritius in March 2019. Flight was cancelled last minute and we took off only the next day. We lost a full day and when we tried to be compensated no answer it took 4 months before they came back to me saying Im sorry we can do anything but next time you can have access to the salon. I was business class so I always have access to the salon and priority check in and I wont go back there. Food was average comfort below average. The only positive was the service on board.
Terrible experience. They managed to lose my bag and its been 4 days and I still dont have my suitcase. I spent close to 3 hours waiting at the carousel then in line to the lost and found office there were about 20 people from the same flight who didnt get their bags they gave me a piece of paper with the tracking number and their contact info. I tried to call the number many many times and nobody answers. I sent emails no response. 4 days and I still dont have my bag and have no information on where it might be or what to do next. If something goes wrong you wont be able to get in touch with them.
Pakse to Vientiane nice new aircraft on time good service would be happy to fly again with this airline.
Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai. Despite recent reports about the extent to which Emirates quality of service has declined I was impressed with every aspect of these two A380 flights. The limo pickup was on time with a friendly and helpful driver and there was only a short walk to business checkin. The Emirates lounge at Birmingham airport is spacious and well stocked and was only an equally short walk to the gate. Boarding was prompt and I will shown to my seat. There was a good choice of food and it was well served. My only criticism would have been the delay in bringing a glass of wine forgetting my postflight drink and having to ask to top it up. Apart from that the food was delicious and in a reasonable portions. The first A380 had the new design for the bar and there was a friendly group of passengers. The transfer at Dubai was quick and painless although allowing both economy and business passengers to exit through the same time did add some delay to exiting the aircraft. The flight to Bangkok was overnight and I chose to sleep. With the mattress the seat was comfortable and I managed to sleep for a good three hours before being awoken for breakfast. The WiFi connection on the plane was surprisingly stable and fast and there were enough movies to keep me entertained. Having flown on Emirates on a number of occasions in the past I was relieved that although other accounts may be accurate I found these two flights to high standard with nothing significant to complain about. The cabin crew were chatty and friendly and always keen to help answer any questions or respond to requests.
Frequently flown Frankfurt to Milan LinateMalpensa or Munich to Milan Malpensa. Airline is good and generally on schedule. But to my utter disappointment the snack on the return leg frequently is only nonvegetarian. Planes are usually small so one can expect a bumpy flight.
Tbilisi to Baku. Everything went smoothly here. Boarding was quick and on time. We were pushed back on time which also meant the flight left on time. It was only a short hop of 55mins. I will see how they are again when I fly 3 hours plus on my next flight. Overall No issues. Airline very smooth and would recommend.
My flights were on time. We were well received on board and warm welcome from Farangis and Karanveer the service was great. The flight attendants were pleasant and efficient. The First class Lounge in Doha is very comfortable. Services start from the airport where you do check in in firs class private section then to separate immigration section then to luxury and big lounge where you can eat and relax and end with very nice and luxury seats and services.
Frankfurt to Haneda. I have reviewed the outward flight First Class to Heathrow but my experience in Business Class allowed me to compare the two levels of service offered. My seat on NH0224 was 9H. On the Boeing 777 the Business class seats are staggered and there is no one sitting side by side. There is not quite the same level of privacy as in First but I found the seat quite uncomfortable. First of all it is rather narrow and I found that I could not place my arms side by side. They had to be on the armrests even when the seat was reclined or made completely flat. For this reason I was not able to do the latter and did not sleep well as a result. The seat was comfortable enough when reclined but the screen is smaller than in First and I was at the distance where wearing glasses made no different to the clarity of the film. The food was reasonably good and since I was returning home I chose the Japanese menu. However I did not feel like sampling the meal offered just before landing. Since the flight was a relatively short 10 hours this was no hardship. Overall I think I expected better of a 5star airline.
I used this company flights few times and it was with troubles always. My flights were delayed from 1 till 3 hours which was unappreciated especially when I was in transit. Their customer service is always unavailable you cannot call them from any country exclude their native Turkey but if you are there and trying to call them they dont answer in 90 cases. They provide no answer by proposed on site WhatsApp and by email on noticed time its over 48 hours each time. But when they answer you it is absolutely inapplicable because they provide you link to website or info from website only and never answer to your solid question. Usage of their services it just waste of money time and your mental health. And when you onboard finally you should pay for all including glass of water. I have extremely worst experience with this company
LGWTFS in November 2014. Flight left Gatwick at about 0900hrs to arrive Tenerife at 1340 hours. We were served a croissant and cereal bar plus coffee and a yoghurt at about 1000hrs. No further trolley service at all during this four and a half hour flight. On the return leg leaving Tenerife at 1415hrs we were served a wrap and a cheese roll with either drink from the bar or hot drink. The drinks were served after the meal. No further trolley service. The seating configuration was tight to say the least and I am 58. This felt like a budget airline flight. The Captain asked us to enjoy British Airways hospitality
Athens to London Heathrow return. British Airways really annoyed me with paying for seat selection. As a result I try my luck and board the plane last without paying for seat selection. For short haul flights it is worth the risk. Otherwise the usual British Airways service. Food has improved over the past few years pilots and cabin crews quite pleasant to interact with. Planes in decent condition.
I was very unhappy with Avelo Airlines bag checkin service and boarding process at Tweed Airport in New Haven on the afternoon of February 24. I had to take my bag to a checkin clerk in a temporary building attached to the terminal and then wheel it into the terminal after she attached a ticket to the bag. In the terminal I had to push the bag under a plexiglass opening to a TSA person. Next I prepaid for priority boarding but nobody cared about that. There was a crowd of people trying to push through the gate. The boarding was 100 outdoors. Part of the ramp to the door of the plane was steep.
Johannesburg to Dubai. I am gluten and dairy intolerant and I could not eat from the standard menu onboard. I requested fresh fruit a few times and was told there was none. When I went to the toilet I saw the staff putting away trolleys at the back of the plane and saw fresh apples. When I took my seat I requested an apple and was told that there is none. I was really disappointed in Emirates. I was told I could have a biscuit which I had to decline.
I had booked a flight for my husband and me for a flight from Wellington to Christchurch on February 13 2013. Unfortunately my American Airlines flight from Dallas to Auckland on February 1 was cancelled due to an ice storm in Dallas. American Airlines could not get me a new flight arriving in Auckland until February 14 at the earliest so I had to cancel my entire trip to New Zealand. I spoke to an Air New Zealand customer service agent after being on hold for 2 hours. I explained the situation. The agent checked with her supervisor and relayed to me the bad news that I would not get a refund tickets cost 170. I was told I could change the flight dates with a change flight fee of 64.72 for the two tickets but I had to pick now the new fly date. Furthermore she said I couldnt book past January 2024. I plan to rebook my flight to New Zealand for February 2024. So if I booked 2 tickets for some random date in January then changed them when I finalized my travel dates for February 2024 I would have to pay a flight change fee again of 64.72. Given that my international flight was cancelled due to weather which was beyond my control it seems reasonable that my fare would be refunded or at least that I be given a travel voucher to use in the future. I will not book with this airline in the future.
Istanbul to London 24th November had delay so that when me and my wife got to London airport unfortunately we missed the next flight as boarding was closed already. I talked to Turkish Airlines about the issue they didnt take responsibility. Therefore staying one day in London and I paid more than 2000 dollars to come back to Toronto.
I was departing from the Kansai Osaka terminal 2. Terrible check in service. The person was in a terrible mood and it showed. I checked in online and the website told me my check in was incomplete and I needed to check in at the counter. My turn in line came and the person took my passport. He asked for my seat number. I didnt have it since my online check in was incomplete. We had a little dispute where he mentioned I needed to provide him a seat number and I told him I dont have it and needed to complete my check in at the counter. I went to the colleague beside him since I just needed my tickets. He told his colleague to stop asked me to stop wasting other peoples time and told me to come back over. He eventually printed my tickets. Not to mention my checked in luggage was slightly off symmetrical from the luggage belt. He told me to adjust it.
3 of my 4 flights with Turkish airlines were delayed in this trip and my luggage never appered altough they told me it was onboard. Now they are still looking for my luggage with all my personal things. And it is because I contacted them thet never did. I almost missed my 2 connections but I run the whole airport very bad situation. I cannot recognise this company any more.
Regardless of delays luggage or ticketing issues Virgin Australia has absolutely gone downhill very rapidly. Airplanes are generally dirty outdated and lacking any comfort. Virgin is now almost certainly a budget airline but without the budget prices and is more likely a competitor for Jetstar than Qantas when it comes to service. Regardless of what route Ive taken with them over the last two years it has been even worse each time. The only thing that could salvage this airline is if they dropped their prices to match the quality of their aircraft and customer service.
Sydney to Albury. The fare was cheaper than some rivals on the route. Everything worked like clockwork from checkin to arrival. Checkin easy and friendly. Bussed out to the plane in a timely and orderly manner. Cabin comfort was quite reasonable given the size of the aircraft Saab 340. The flight attendant gave personal and friendly service throughout the flight offering seconds of teacoffee. The flight crew gave periodic updates including the fact that we were arriving 15 minutes early amazing for such a short flight. The flight attendant personally checking with every passenger during the flight to ascertain if anyone wanted them to book ahead for a taxi and the offering of sweets prior to landing were charming touches. Id happily fly Rex again.
Singapore to Christchurch. Singapore Airlines business class is second to none. The moment you enter the aircraft you are greeted by name and the flight attendant takes your drink and dinner orders. I chose the Lobster Thermidor from Book the Cook. It was delicious. Business class is a fine dining experience by itself. You feel that you are being pampered by the very friendly and polite flight attendants. The seat converts to a full flat bed where you can have a good sleep. Instead of pressing a button you have to flip over the seat back to convert it to bed mode but the good thing is that the bed is wider than other business class seats which deploy using a button. You have to sleep diagonally with your body angled such that your legs fit into the cubby hole under the seat in front. Overall it was a wonderful experience on this 9 hour 30 minutes flight. SQ is still top notch when it comes to service delivery on board.
London Heathrow Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 34 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as 700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free is it really free booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad wine. On the way back a ploughmans lunch it was okayish. As a 60 year old businessman one who has worked globally in my career in the US Japan and the Middle East and having sold my business a few years ago to one of the largest PLCs in the country I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh what a surprise and thats the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe Id make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger like an arm chair. A 22 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phoneslaptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6 of leg room behind row 1. Nice cutlery and glasschina ware. Hot meals. And id probably sell it at 25 a flight more. Build value guys and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back on the ground the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk the length of plane asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap. We took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. FAs in both directions were very good.
DjiboutiSanaa. There was a small delay leaving but that was not a problem as the flight is less than 1 hr. During the flight we were given a drink and a sandwich which was nice because the flight is so short. The crew members were professional and spoke Arabic and English not French. I suppose the seats are standard for this kind of plane Boeing 737 and I had ample leg room. Also the plane was not full so I could have 3 seats to myself.
Dubai to Johannesburg with Rwandair. I had the longest flight ever my ticket was changed multiple times the ticket itself did not say we stopped in Lushaka as well. My luggage was lost with presents in for my family and have not heard anything about retrieval.
Bangkok to Singapore. New Aircraft. Cabin okay but cabin crew not engaged like in economy class. Bring food need to ask salt and pepper. Did not bring any coffee after finishing the lunch. Food was similar to Economy. Overall very disappointed.
Business Class Tampa Gatwick. Fantastic service and attentive staff. However seat 10a feels very claustrophobic you also have to step over the footrest of 11b if you want to go to the loo or take a wee walk during the flight.
I had a layover from Vegas to Nashville in Fort Lauderdale FL. Unfortunately my flight in Vegas was delayed which caused an absolute nightmare. I ended up missing my connecting flight and having to rebook for a flight going out to Nashville the next morning. I was basically stuck in FLL for 11 hours with no access to my baggage which had my daily breast cancer medication no discount or hotel voucher and with miscommunication an agent cancelled my AM flight. I had to pay for my hotel and a different ticket with Southwest Airlines. There was no urgency or help from any spirit employee. Over the course of 5 days after landing in Nashville I still had no baggage and no medication. I talked to over 10 agents on the phone about how important my baggage was and no one seemed to think it was a big deal. I paid a total of 392 for my baggage to arrive in Nashville and it took 5 days. They will not refund me my baggage costs or what I spent on a new airline or hotel. They gave me a 50 voucher because that will surely help fight breast cancer and I will surely fly spirit again.... NOT I knew it was a mistake booking flights with spirit in the beginning but I didnt know they would fully dehumanize me and handle this situation beyond the absolute worst. I am not one to leave reviews and can remain calm in bad situations but this was a whole other level of frustration disappointment and wasted money. Not only over charging someone fighting cancer but getting them their medications with no sense of careurgency is disgusting.
That canceled my flight for no reason and no explanation given. They had no other alternative flights and we had to buy very expensive flights from other airline. This is the second time this has happened to me.
I had a fantastic week of holidays in Hurghada and to review a hotel is a must but I also think it is very important to acknowledge the airline which makes it all happen by bringing you over and back in safety. I flew with Air Cairo for the first time there and back after a week and both flights were comfortable and I felt very welcomed. The staff both on the flight on 24 June Prague to Hurghada as well as on 1 July Hurghada to Prague were friendly smiley and professional. At one point there was strong turbulence and the staff were supportive. Next time I fly to Egypt I will go for Air Cairo.
Sydney to Gold Coast. Please be aware of the sly and sneaky business practices of Jetstar airlines. When you do a price comparison against other airlines they look like they have the cheapest prices. In reality they dont. If you want to bring a bag even onboard as carry on you have to pay in some Virgin and Qantas flights its included. Everything costs extra. And then this... The staff were walking around at the boarding gate with a portable scale weighing peoples bags and charging them for each kg extra Ive NEVER seen such gouging before. Desperate for money left a bad taste in everyones mouth. I had 2kg extra and they told me to cough up 65 I will be avoiding Jetstar in the future. I hope you do too.
Booked my daughter a return from UK to Perth and was informed post booking that from 15 12 they are no longer classed as minors so shed have to find her own way through the airport. I wasnt comfortable with that especially during covid so booked and paid for a rather expensive accompanied and assist while transiting through. They took her to a lounge and left her there and someone else came later to assist her to flight no real issues. I realised while checking in on the way back to the UK that the accompanied on the ticket didnt include the return leg which I asked for and assumed with the price paid was completed. We checked at the desk and said hed sorted it out and all was arranged. She landed in Qatar and was told by the staff on the plane to speak to the staff as she got off which she did. They proceeded to tell her nothing was arranged and to find her own way.
Everything is good staff are hospitable and helpful. Multiple kinds of food is provided on the airplane and it is delicious. But i dont know why they arranged the seats to let everyone sit close together.
Booked a return from Leeds to Aberdeen at considerable cost. The outward leg was delayed as flight crew could not be found and operational issues being quoted yet again by the helpful ground crew. On my return again advised that Leeds Flight is cancelled and now flying to Humberside due to operational reasons. Humberside flight delayed by 2 hours. Taxi offered from Humberside to Leeds as is the norm with Eastern. Once again flights cancelled to save fuel costs and everybody stuffed into one aircraft then bussed like cattle to Leeds. Never using this airline again and now decided to drive and use a hotel. This airline is shockingly disappointing in the manner it cancels it late night flight to double up and save cost. Why offer the route if tou have no intention of honouring it.
122013. LHRLAX. A380. Aircraft was clean. Seats were comfortable but the leg space was restricted by the IFE computer which has been installed underneath the seat in front. Amenity kit contained a cushion blanket headphones and toothbrush. There were no eye shades and ear plugs. Food both ways the same selection Tikka Masala or macaroni and cheese of average quality followed by a small ice cream and a sandwich or breakfast croissant. FAs lacked courteousness friendliness and motivation. There was on both flights repeatedly no reaction to the call button and they were several hours not present in the cabin. IFEsystem is good with a big selection of movies documentaries etc. Due to a malfunction the system had to be restarted which erased the preferences. This experience with British Airways is not compatible to other flag carriers due to the lack in service and the restricted seating.
Sapporo to Phuket via Seoul. Horrendous problem solving by the Korean Air team. We were left to wait on on the plane for 3.5 hours due to engine failure and upon reaching Seoul they didnt come up with any viable solution to replace our missed Korean Air connecting flight Their solution in the end is to downgrade us all from our original business class seating to economy. Even though my husband and I paid a Business class ticket we had upgraded our small children using points from a paid economy ticket to business tickets. So we have now lost half a day for extra travel time. Since they are now rerouting us via Hong Kong 2 Insulted by the KoreanAir team by their Lack of acknowledgement of their Screw up and Our right to proper seatings. Absolutely no proper compensation for our loss on Business class tickets and Morning Calm mileage points. Its most shocking and mind you we are traveling with our very patient but very exhausted 6 year old twins
Unfriendly staff who you have to ask twice for water etc. Terrible meals I had a beef lasagna that was inedible uncomfortable seating a poor infotainment system and no one had informed us. This was an alcoholfree flight. The state of Cairo International Airport was equally as poor toilets lounges staff friendliness cafes etc.
Inadvertently whist booking online the childs surname was incorrectly entered. I tried to get the changes made through the airline as well as the agent the only answers I got was could not be changed due to policy. I lost close to 1800 tickets for mother and baby. Plenty of time almost 20 hrs in calling the agent and Airline.
Xiamen to Amsterdam. Bit of a mixed bag. The food and seat comfort were quite decent but a few other issues would make me think before travelling with Xiamen Airlines again. Cabin crew had very limited English to the point they didnt understand the word vegetarian when they came around with the meal. The cabin temperature fluctuated greatly on the flight and to make matters worse I was sat next to overweight passenger who smelt strongly of alcohol and had no concept of personal space. After he had elbowed me for about the 10th time I decided to look for another seat but by now everyone was sleeping and simply decided to stick it out. I could have asked one of the crew but given their level of English I thought better of it. The economy seats have UK style power sockets so useful for laptops as the inflight entertainment is somewhat limited although the screen and entertainment system was quick with none of the usual lags I have experienced on other airlines.
I went to Jamaica for a week on vacation and I have no complaints regarding Caribbean airlines. Not the best airline on the planet but theyre definitely by far not the worst they are reasonable and if youre willing to spend a bit more than business class definitely is substantially more comfortable. The only drawback that I can think of but that isnt their fault is the fact that on the return trip I had to make four stops in four different countries.
Phu Quoc to Bangkok. For some ridiculous reason Bangkok Airways sent a reminder around 25 hours prior to departure reminding me to check in online. That would have saved so much time only the airline does not permit online check in for this flight Deciding to arrive early at the airport was a major mistake Three checkin desks yet the act of checking in was the slowest I can recall in decades of travelling. No doubt this was a result of many passengers with connecting codeshare flights at BKK but there were also ticket problems with some. To wait 30 minutes to get to a desk when there were only 40 passengers in the various queues before me was infuriating when a simple bag drop would have taken only minutes had internet check in been an option. At this airport passport control also takes forever. Then Bangkok Airways uses a bus gate. Boarding was a slow joke with many passengers forced to bake in the midday heat with no cover and no access to sun protection cream. The two flight attendants seemed thoroughly bored throughout the flight. The gourmet meal was a starchy stodgy spinach cream puff and a hard coconut cream. I left most on the tray. Then at BKK another bus gate with a driver who seemed to take us all round the airport before doubling back. Had this been a budget carrier I could have accepted its failures. For an airline with such a major reputation this was a massive disappointment.
Dubai to Jeddah with Flynas. Seats are okay and the staff is okay. We had a stroller baby cart. When we got out of the plane they didnt take out the stroller. It also did not come out with the rest of our luggage. We had to wait good 45 minutes for Flynas representative to get to his desk as he was on a 10 minute break Finally he informed us that the stroller is in the other terminal. There is no way for them to bring the stroller to us so we had to go to the other terminal by a taxi and get the stroller ourselves. This cost us 2 hours and 100 Riyal extra as the taxi driver had to wait for an hour for us to finally find our stroller. Why couldnt they bring the stroller out when we were getting out of the plane or even send it through the luggage area. Would never recommend this airline.
Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. Felt a bit uneasy due to the late arrival of transit passengers without IFE functioning. But the catering was nice especially the cookies. After handing out my flight log the cabin crews designated the two pages well plus offering me some goodies to complete my journey to the best.
The flight was on time. I bought the ticket online. I paid a total of 8000 baht for a round trip as an offer was there. Crews were friendly. Food was good. Check in at Dhaka was good.
I absolutely hate Allegiant. Our flight has been delayed traveling both ways. I have been delayed for hours now and still no notification email or text that the flight was delayed. The absolute worst experience I have ever had flying.
Rio de Janeiro to London . Economy packed out seating awful food very narrow seats uncomfortable expensive add ons seat choice luggage try to match Norwegian pricing on the Rio route IFE was iffy. My back and legs have been terrible for 3 days I paid 77 for an exit seat the breakfast served was unfit for me I took my own drinks and some food items. Long haul is getting the same as short. Come prepared
I got the priority seating. Paid extra for it. It was fine in Mineapolis to Raleigh Durham cause I went through TSA quicker but leaving Raleigh it made no sense. There was absolutely no difference. Do not get the Priority seating. The airline staff said I basically wasted my money. Thanks Sun Country You will not be missed
Our return flight from Herkaklion on Crete to Frankfurt on September 25th started with a long queue outside the airport. TUIfly had so many passengers on that day that there wasnt enough space for all people inside the terminal. We had to wait 1 hour for the baggage drop off. Half of the time staying in the sun. Everything seemed to be very disorganized. The aircraft arrived early on Crete which ment also an early departure and arrival for us. The plane was around 9 years old and owned by TUIfly. A totally different experience than on the way to Crete with a leased airplane. The seat offered a very comfortable seat pitch with plenty of space to move around. The cabin and washrooms looked clean. On cabin screens the safety video an airshow and advertisement were shown. Also on some tables stickers with advertisement were installed. While boarding the flight attendants distributed wine gums to everybody. During the flight we had the same choice between a sandwich with cheese or ham. It seemed the flight Crew was quiet desinterested in their job. No smile at all noisy deposit of service equipment and slangannouncements by the purser. But the flight crew gave us often information concerning the flight. Dont expect much but if the price is good I would fly them again.
Booked to fly Monarch Airlines from Tenerife to London. This is the worst customer service you can ever imagine. I tried to check in online 24 hours before because I wanted to sit next to my 4 year old daughter and there is no option to check in online if you have booked with anybody else. I had to wait 20 minutes on the phone to hear somebody try to flog me things I dont want. I eventually spoke to somebody who said they would only do it for 22 Euros. I asked if they would put my 4 year old alone in the cabin if they refused and they said yes
New YorkLagosAccra return. The cabin crew was excellent. The Arik staff at Lagos airport were not the nicest people and they demanded money for everything. From Accra my group and I checked in as a group without any problems but because the folks in Nigeria wanted more Kobos and Nairas. In any case this will be my last flight on Arik unless major changes are made.
It is way beyond terrible I bought tickets from NYC to Shanghai and then to Qingdao. They cancelled my 2nd flight 2 weeks before I take off without any explanation not to mention any refund And that means I overpaid them with 1700 only for the trip from NYC to Shanghai The worst airline ever.
SiborongBorong to Jakarta. Hotline of this one is almost impossible to reach. for 25 kg extra luggage from DTB airport to Jakarta they want 3.1 million IDR extra more than for the original flight. if I prepay. I dont want to know how much it is when I am paying at the airport .. already cancelled the second flight with them and booked a flight with AirAsia. This was cheaper than to pay extra luggage. Stay away from this airline or just travel with max 15 kg checkedin luggage. We are doing 12 months world trip so not possible for us.
Pleasantly surprised with my 1 12 hour trip from New Dehli to Katmandu. No issues Left just a few mins late. Would have arrived on time but thunderstorms in Kathmandu forced us to hold for 20 mins in the air. Staff were pleasant and a full meal was served. Decent value with little to complain about. Would use again.
Took TR2904 SINMFM on 4 August 2014. Flight was punctual service friendly seat quite comfortable for a budget air. One of my best TR flight so far.
Dubrovnik to Gatwick with British Airways operated by Titan Airways. A fantastic flight a very nice and modern cabin interior with lots of legroom and very friendly crew. Would definitely fly with Titan again
BA34 KULLHR 6 Sept return BA11 LHRSINKUL on 16 Sept. All flights in World Traveller Plus with the exception of SINKUL on MH economy. On the KULLHR leg the aircraft was clean and spacious in the PY cabin. The seats were the biggest let down. Whilst there was adequate legroom they were hard and uncomfortable especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support. The headrest did not move at all. The seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which I think is a missed opportunity by BA to maximise utilisation of space. The food was okay you get two meals the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke. IFE was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging. The return flight was on an A380. Excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight. Again seats were the same but the A380 has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin. Staff were less conspicuous this time around. Overall I would recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats.
I had a First Class Ticket booked with Emirates back in December 2019. I took the outbound flight but the inbound flight was canceled due to Covid19. Emirates offered a voucher to change my flight for free. However the covid situation was taking too long I wasnt planning to take any flight before the voucher expired. And then I requested a refund in July 2023 and got emailed back from Emirates. They confirmed that the refund had been approved to Amex my original payment card. I contacted Amex 10 working days later and was told that Amex not received the refund. Amex had to fill a form to raise the case for investigation but they need details on the refund amount. So I contacted Emirates to confirm whether they had refund the ticket or not and how much was the amount refunded. Emirates representative advised that the other representative was chasing the refund and she refused to tell me any more details nor give me information on the amount to be refund. I asked to be transfer to the relevant department. She agreed to do so and then hung up the call.
Air France changed my original connecting flight from Paris to Stuttgart so that instead of spending a couple of hours in transit I had to stay overnight 16 hours in total. Even being a gold member and knowing it was not my wish to stay but its choice they did not let me get in the lounge nor did they offer any kind of option. When I got to my terminal 2G they said in a very unfriendly way that the hall is closed over night and I have to leave. Thanks to the wonderful airport worker who was very friendly and clearly explained to me how to find my way back to other terminal where I can spend the night to come back to this one in the morning. Chaotic experience and very unhelpful and unfriendly AF personal
The queue for bag drop was massive and did not move for a good 20 mins. A more senior person came and explained it was due to software issues that there was a delay in the bag drop. Excuses as I saw more staff came afterwards and the queue was moving fine. They could have just got more staff there to begin with. Group boarding was super slow. Inside the econ cabin the plane seemed very old and wornout. The entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they didnt inform the customers about it. Some of the flight attendants were unprofessional. Meals were bad for me the dinner was some sort of curry chicken that did not taste good. They gave energy bars for breakfast meal on a 6h 50 mins flight. The wifi doesnt exist in the cabin.
Milan to Istanbul on new A321neo. Incredible seat with a super HD screen and soft product for a 150 min flight. Meal was excellent. Landed ahead of time. Cabin manager was amazing while the other attendant serving in business was a little on the unexperienced side. Free WiFi for business class.
Pucallpa to Lima. This has been my worst experience with an airline. I was traveling from Pucallpa on 24th July 2018 to Lima. The flight should have been at 1610 and I was at the airport more than two hours before the flight. When I arrived together with my friends my flight was not listed on the departure screens and when finally the Peruvian staff got available I was informed that there was a delay 5 hours. However I was checked in and knew I would not make my connection flight from Lima back to Europe at 8PM. I was forced to buy a new ticket which cost me 700 USD. Not only that the new flight got me too late for my work and I lost a customer because of this. At the airport the staff did not know any information about the flight nor the plane nor even when there would be the departure. Instead we kept being promised lied that the flight will depart another hour later and later on again and again. In the end the flight departed only at 2345. This caused me so many problems with no compensation whatsoever no apology no support at the airport no interest in the customer. This was for the last time I used services of this airline.
I was booking the ticket from Kansas City to Dallas Dallas to San Fransisco San Frasisco to Hong Kong and from Hong Kong to Da Nang 2432020. The airline did not say anything about only Hong Kong residents can fly. When I got to San Fransisco they email me the ticket is canceled. Why didnt you tell me for the first time Then the airline said I can get a full refund intermediately but now it is nearly 24h after that. Also the airline didnt rebook for me for another flight or at least buy the ticket for me to get back in Kansas City and left me back overnight in the airports. Nonetheless they keep my luggage and I did not receive my luggage yet. Now Im like a homeless in San Fransisco airport.
Fly Monarch Airlines frequently as not basic and extra leg room seats very comfortable. Delayed 1hr due to problem with aircraft fortunately replacement aircraft available at Gatwick so ready to go pretty quickly. Ground staff not very informative or organised. Flight crew visible and spoke to passengers a nice touch explaining and apologising for delay. The cabin crew were pleasant and apologetic service efficient with a smile. An enjoyable flight.
This is regarding my flight booking from Mumbai to Berlin via Istanbul on 14th March. Due to the ongoing corona virus and the University being shut down Information received from College on 12th of march I could not travel on the same date. I tried calling the airline multiple times on 12th and 13th March but did not get any reply. I did not expect this kind of response from your airline.
London to Barbados. Having used Avios points when making the reservation we were very disappointed about the high charge to reserve seats in advance. The crew were very pleasant and the aircraft was reasonably clean but there was choice of main meal available. British Airways policy of offering a fun size Mars bar instead of a second meal is unacceptable. In our opinion the airline are offering a budget experience at a premium price and we will not be making any further bookings with them.
Checkin started three and half hours before takeoff. Premium economy passengers are allowed to use Sky Priority checkin so it was quick and easy. Boarding started on time. AFs premium economy seat is in a hard shell so it slides forward to recline. On this flight I found my seat was working so I got full recline where my wifes seat was slightly broken and did not recline fully. Like the journey to DXB the PE cabin was in need of a refresh so while clean it was showing its age. I did find the seat comfortable when fully reclined and managed to get 5 hours of sleep. A snack was served after takeoff which was significantly better than the micro tuna sandwich we got coming to DXB. Breakfast was served 90 min before landing in CDG. Choice was omelette or creme. Both choices were unmemorable at best. The IFE system was ok but the choices seemed limited and the flight was not wifi enabled. The crew on this flight were very french and seemed grumpy bordering rude. We landed early at CDG which was a good thing as the line for transfer security was ridiculously long for 6 am. The flight to LHR was a standard intra European flight but AF still managed to serve a snack and drink during the 45 min flight. Again for the price point I cannot recommend AF premium economy it is simply not twice as good as regular economy.
The day before I was scheduled to fly back to the states I tested positive for covid. I called Emirates and they said I would be unable to fly back but that they could keep my ticket and place it on hold. When I went to change the date to fly back they made me pay the fare difference. In this case the cheapest fare difference I could get within a two week period was 400. How an airline can you charge you for getting covid is insane. Im so disappointed and upset. Their customer service team on the phone was awful. I will never fly with Emirates again after this experience. I didnt ask for covid and got financial punished for it.
Brunei to Tokyo. I was seated at 39. it was a full flight and when come to meal service a male purser was offering my seat mate a choice of Fish and Beef. When come to my turn he didnt ask me what would i like but asking me any drinks for you sir Moments later my meal is given to me and i ask him what is the main course he said its fish. As i have not fancied fish meal i ask him what can i have. Heraise his voice at me we do not have the beef anymore what we have left is fish. I told him i do not eat fish so ask if beef is available on the other cart He is reluctant and without checking said this is full flight and we dont cater extras meal on board its just fish we have left. do you want it or not I told him to take back the fish meal and left me with the small portion of dessert that came with the set meal I understand the meals are limited to selection especially when you seated in the middle section of the aircraft when meal serving are last but you dont have to yell or speak loud to me when everyone needs to turn back and look at me. Its kind of embarrassing for that moment
SW286 in economy in mid December 2014. Ive taken this flight a number of times over the past 10 years this ranked as one of the better experiences by far. First and most important Air Namibia is now using a pair of relatively new leased Airbus 330200s on this route. The difference between this and the old Airbus Boeing 747s and MD8s are striking. The passenger cabin is clean relatively modern and well lit. The seats have seatback entertainment systems. I travel with an iPad preloaded with movies I want to watch so I cant speak to the entertainment menu itself. The food was relatively bland simple but edible. They serve a breakfast close to landing but its not up to much. Seat comfort I was in 20H on the aisle adjacent to the bathrooms. Seat doesnt recline but there is no electrical box under the seat in front of you in row H. Flight departed FRA on time and arrived Windhoek 15 minutes early. The flight attendants were for the most part polite efficient and attentive without being fussy or cloying. This works fine for me but not for everyone. The flight is quite rigorously structured drinks with a hot meal are served relatively soon after takeoff. The cabin lights are then turned off completely for the bulk of the flight at least 6 hours. The cabin lights dont come back on until 2 hours before landing. All in all good value for the money and much more comfortable than I remember in the past. I remember this flight being more of an endurance ordeal than anything else Ive flown SW286 on and off since 2000 and these new planes make all the difference.
Taipei to Vancouver. Relatively new A350 with comfortable seats and nice 11 IFE screen with USB and power outlet. The back seat design lacks enough forethought in not making available slots for tablets and mobile phones and a hook for small items to hang. Having said that there is good legroom space. The entertainment choice is still limited. The flight crew service was better than the ICNTPE leg but they lack the courteousness that other Asian airlines are known for. One example one flight attendant told a passenger to bring the seat back upright for a meal. She was quite rude and abrupt. For a Chinese her manner would have been viewed as a typical request but as a flight attendant serving passengers of various nationalities that would not be acceptable. She looked as if she was one of the more senior member of the flight crew. The food was still below average and the flight attendants were once again rushing through the meal service offering coffee and tea even though passengers had not finished the main meal. Overall they lack the expected attention to detail and professionalism to compete effectively with other airlines. The excellent hardware ie. the plane is let down by the subpar flight crew service.
They have different policies for call center booking and airport booking for missed flights. If you are unaware of it you will end up paying unfairly for all. Customer care agents at Brisbane airport are not at all helpful. They will finish their personal talk before attending to you. I was there 30 minutes prior to the plane taking off without any checkin bags and have been refused to board while others 3 to 4 minutes before leaving the plane got in. They will never refund your money. They are extremely expensive and I dont see the hype for that. After 1 month of waiting all they said is they are not going to refund the money.
London to Berlin scheduled for 21st December. On approach to the airport I got a message saying that my flight was canceled. No explanation was given. As I arrived at the airport staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues and if I wanted to travel in the next days ahead of Christmas I should book my own travel with another airline or train company e.g. Eurostar. My costs would be reimbursed. The airport staff also said no further help from British Airways is available on the day to due airport issues. I felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty 300 GBP fare for a short haul flight for the next day. As it was Christmas prices were very high. After I arrived at my destination a lengthy exchange of messages with British Airways started and British Airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation.
Shenyang to London Gatwick via Tianjin. A new route recently opened between London Gatwick and Tanjian and as a regular traveller between the UK and China I felt it was worth giving it a go. The initial pick up from Shenyang was easy enough. A small domestic flight between Shenyang and Tianjin. As my flight to London wasnt until the following morning Tianjin Airlines would provide 3 star accommodation for the night free of charge. Whilst this was communicated during the initial booking no details were given in an email. I arrive into Tianjin with a man telling me to ring this number for the hotel pick up. The process was badly organised. The hotel did not speak a word of English or very broken English. I was told that the hotel was full and no rooms were available. There is no visible desk for Tianjin Airlines within the airport at Tianjin which I find ludicrous. I relied on a local tourist desk for help. Eventually I found my way to the hotel where again I was told no room or I would have to pay 350 RMB for a room Eventually another passenger was experiencing the same problem and spoke perfect mandarin. Crisis averted Overall the experience was very poorly managed. No clear visibility at the airport and unclear instructions. The hotel room was pleasant enough similar to an Ibis or Travelodge. Clean with air conditioning. When booking the website clearly advertised the route as Tianjin to London Gatwick with no stops. Bar internal domestic flight from Shenyang. In the end we had to stop at Chongqing for two hours. The main flight to London Gatwick was standard long haul. Unlimited water and soft drinks. Chinese style food with a snack. The drinks service was given after the food service which I found strange when compared to other providers. The food was okay. The inflight entertainment was terrible or nonexistent. Normally long haul flights will have a good selection of international films. Everything was pretty much Chinese except for the IT Crowd. So random For an 11 hour flight you need a decent selection to pass the time. The flight itself totalled 34 hours travel time. I normally pay between 540 560 with China Southern. Total travel time is normally around the 2627 hour mark. The new route between Tianjin and Gatwick only cost 335. If you book earlier you can sometimes get it for 275 one way. Perhaps the amount you pay is reflected in the experience. Overall with no flight delays and a competent service the new route between Tianjin and London Gatwick offers good value for money. However the difficulties encountered in communicating the hotel diversion to Chongqing not highlighted on website and lack of in flight entertainment for European customers lacked the finesse rival airlines provide. If the new route is to succeed price alone will not judge its success. The carrier must provide a like for like experience considering the nature of other long haul providers offering a more well rounded experience.
I have to say that I am increasingly disappointed in Allegiant Air every time I have an interaction with them. They are cheap and I will give them that however on many occasions over the years of flying that I have done with them I realize that they are more trouble than they are worth. They delay the flights often for many hours this has happened on multiple occasions charge you for a change in flight date and charge you if you cancel a flight after 24 hours for a lot of money. Their flight attendants at times are not on time or they are poorly managed. There are many issues that I have personally witnessed and I am unhappy with the service I have received from them.
Winnipeg to Punta Cana via Toronto. Me and my family have flown many times on Air Canada and Air Canada rouge but this has to be the best time ever. When we left Winnipeg the flight attendant noticed that my mother has trouble walking so she talked to the ground staff in Winnipeg who then called Toronto and arranged a wheel chair for her when we landed to get us to our next flight. We could have made it on our own but the compassion and care that this flight staff gave to us really made our whole familys day.
Tokyo to Honolulu. I usually fly premium economy or business if Im lucky. I was terribly worried about this flight to and from Hawaii in the normal economy but I was pleasantly surprised They FAs were extremely cheerful and hardworking. The catering was adequate and delicious. The cabin kept very clean including the toilets. The star of the show is the seats. My goodness Im a big person 183 cm tall and 230 kg and even I was comfortable I couldnt believe the legroom and the seat width of these wider seats. They are premium economy standard on many US airlines but extended to the entire economy class. On the downside JAL is notorious for keeping the planes warm since Japanese are adverse to air conditioning and even air passing over their skin. I always take a fan to keep cool. Also the AVOD is lacking. This is the one area they simply must improve upon. Oh they offer wifi onboard but it didnt work for me or my partner. It never prompted with a pay screen and it was not free.
Brussels to Tokyo Narita via Doha. The checkin was ok smooth but I wasnt offered any special seats despite my OW Sapphire status. The security fasttrack which should have been on my ticket barcode didnt work I had to call staff to let me go in. BA lounge access not up to midlonghal standards required for the 6 hour flights to DOH. There are no shower facilities and the food choices are limited to a breakfast setup despite the evening departure. QR boarded their flight one hour ahead of depature time which seems excessive. On top of poor seat width the pitch seemed too tight and Im not a giant. There was a IFE box stealing 20 of my feet area and no footrest. Storage in the seat pocket was poor I couldnt fit my water bottles. PTV remote was covered in smudges. I had ordered a special meal low fat which was pasta. The pasta was dry. The fruit salad showed signs of decay. The salad looked ok but the vinaigrette tasted awful. The bread was not freshly baked. In the bathroom no amenities were offered in economy. The marking on the flushing button in the bathroom was unreadable. The cabin temperature was cold but a good fleece blanket offered. I asked the cabin crew to raise the temperature and was answered that the captain would have to decide on that. IFE systems was loaded with advertisement. The flight stopped at a remote stand and we had to be bussed. After deplaning I was suppposed to have 2 hours between flights to enjoy in the business cass lounge but I only spent 5 minutes in there.
Appalling customer service. Booked a RT flight from Adelaide AUS to Nelson NZ to see family for the first time since COVID. Just received an email with a flight change from Qantas for our return flight but theyve completely forgotten that we are departing from Nelson NZ Auckland arriving at 2pm and booked our departing flight out of Auckland at 6am the same morning. How on earth do we get on a flight that departs Auckland 8 hours before we even arrive from Nelson Now on hold for 2 hours no assistance provided. Last time that I book with Qantas.
Singapore Airlines has impressed me on the SingaporeSydney route for the first time. It is evident that the morning flights are much better than the night time flights. As SQ 211 departed a great lunch was served followed by multiple drink rounds before a mini pizza prior to landing which compares well against the red eye SQ221 and 231. The staff were quite courteous with the exception of one cabin crew member the rest were extremely pleasant. Specially the leading crew in charge was particularly friendly. Flight landed ahead of schedule and all in all I couldnt fault the service.
Singapore to Istanbul via Doha. The new Qatar Lounge in Singapore is for sure the best among all Qatar lounges outside Doha. Food service and design were topnotch. Both flights had the usual high Qatar Airways standard with top notch service and food. The reason why I could not give full marks this time is that dreadful new safety video I had to endure 4 times. Its childish painful for the ears and eyes. Please give me my old safety video back.
Im having this flight for the second time and it was late both of the times. This time we had to wait for 5 hour and we were not even informed earlier. We got to know about the delay when we checked in. I wont travel with this airline again.
Worst experience ever I have to cancel my reservation due a back injury that Im going to have surgery for. When I informed easyJet of this and asked for a credit voucher so that when I recover from my surgery and able to travel again I can use this to book a flight using the money that I paid for the flight that has to be cancelled. They offered me nothing and customer service was extremely rude and disrespectful. They made numerous lies and insulted me and basically told me to get lost and told me that they was not going to do anything. This is the thanks that I got for years of flying on easyJet.
Tehran to New York via Istanbul. Terrible experience and terrible customer service Will never fly again. I tried to change my flight date called the airline and they made the changes. Told me I would be getting a confirmation email after I hang up Never received it. I called back submitted my request again and was told that someone would get back to me in at most 7 days Never happened again. I called back this was 3 days to the actual flight date was told I need to go to a Airline office to make a change. The closest office to me is 250 miles away. Also there was a schedule change on the ticket that I did not confirm. When I called I was told that I would not get charged the penalty I ended up getting chargedthe fare difference almost 500. In addition to the trip cost 200 for a one way trip. So this has never happened before with any other airline. It would have been easier to cancel and buy a new flight which would have cost me around 800 for a two way.
Minsk to Gatwick. A very pleasant flight. Boarding was quick the aircraft was clean and the seating was 33. Leg room was adequate. The flight took off on time and landed on time. Meal service consisted of a standard hot meal with soft drinks and tea or coffee. No alcohol was offered. This was a short 2 12 hrs flight and so the meal was very good. There was no inflight entertainment.
Its important to know that if you book a ticket in economy you cant change your flight date if you need to. With over a months notice they would not let me change my flight date. I had to lose the entire ticket full payment. First thing is they should warn you about this at booking. I understand paying a penalty but having to pay the entire ticket is unbelievable to me. Ill never fly with them ever and Ill advise others to avoid them also.
I booked tickets for my family to travel from Melbourne to Delhi for which I paid extra money for food and baggage In the flight they didnt offer any food and on asking them they refuse and said that you will get food only in connecting flight. We paid extra 51 for food there and get only half dish of pasta for that. Worst experience ever. I recommend to not travel with Malindo Air.
I traveled from London Heathrow to Bangkok return with EVA Air. This is the first time we have traveled with EVA Air in premium economy. I have to say they are one of the best airlines we have used way better than British Airways. From check in everything was smooth. In flight entertainment seat comfort food and cleanliness are very good. Flight crew extremely proficient and friendly and nothing was too much for them. I did not use wifi on the flight so unable to give a view. Thank you EVA Air
I went on a packaged tour to Uzbekistan during October 2014 and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. We flew from Madrid to Tashkent and the airplanes were new with your own video shame it only showed Uzbek films and clean. We had the rudest stewardess I have met. Their English is good. The food was OK. Overall not bad. We also took smaller flights inside of Uzbekistan and they all left on time were clean the stewardesses were friendly and overall the experience was very good.
Moscow to London. Fantastic first class service. The Moscow lounge was surprisingly good with excellent Runway views. Quick boarding and I was escorted to my seat by the crew. The new First seats on the 7879 fleet are a real upgrade from the older product. Theres plenty of space a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space. The 23 inch flatscreen IFE screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones. The dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic the best airline meal Ive had. Drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival. The crew were very attentive and friendly with it. A fantastic experience and Ill look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin.
Check in and security at LHR efficient. Went to Galleries North which was busy but fine with good service. Left from B gates. Efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We dont tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise. Overall a good flight.
London to Abu Dhabi. I told BA at checkin that I would be interested in upgrading to Premium Economy if a window seat was available. The lady replied can I check you are only interested in upgrading if there is a window. I replied yes. After a series of phone calls the upgrade was processed I paid 149 GBP. My seat had no window or view at all as that seat is situated at the back of Premium Economy where the toilets should be. When I complained I was told that seats could not be guaranteed so I had no complaint. No refund offered no token gesture offered nothing. The food was nice and the seat was very comfortable. If it wasnt for the rude customer service I would fly again. I was led to believe I could pay for a window seat and I paid in good faith. Ive flown BA for years but this year has been disappointing. I wont fly with them again.
Flight from Athens to Heathrow delayed by 30 minutes which seems to be the norm for this flight with BA. However a few minutes before call to board an announcement came over that that no food nor drink would be available on this flight no explanation as to the reason. Fortunately I was in the business lounge so grabbed a can of coke and a couple of rolls but for others they would have no time to purchase anything even if they are happy to pay airport prices. This was a 4 hour flight by the way. I had no idea that BA are now charging for food and drink even for water they kept that one quiet. I rarely travel with hold luggage so now have to pay extra for the luxury of choosing a half decent seat they kept that one quiet as well when this policy was introduced last spring. How long before they start charging for airport check in or duplicate documents the same as Ryanair. Will they be selling lottery tickets next Payasyou go toilet British Airways still refer to themselves as the worlds favourite airline. Based on whos opinion exactly See no point in using BA now. They usually come out as one of the most expensive carriers when choosing a route. They have the most ignorant and unhelpful cabin staff out of any other carriers. I fly about 100 times annually through business and try and avoid BA. With this latest money grabbing scam I will change my scheduling to avoid them. There are plenty other quality carriers who like BA are struggling to maintain profits. All have the same threat of terrorism fluctuating oil prices adverse weather airtraffic control strikes etc. but they are not punishing the very people who keep their planes in the air.
Prague to London Heathrow. British Airways have lost the plot. BA is now a budget airline and offers the bare minimum of services for a higher than budget fare. Checkin is ridiculous as you wait for all the other categories to be processed such as gold members bronze members families business class silver members. They do at last get round to calling for anyone left and then its a scowl from the shabby attendant as you board the plane. Seating is fair though leg room is tight. The flight left a little late but arrived almost on time which was fine. There is no food nor even a coffee provided and a couple of flight attendants come down the aisle at a snails pace with a trolley. I cant believe BA now make passengers pay extra for food and drink. BA shows itself up as very much a budget airline and a fr cry from its illustrious past. I wonder what has happened to BA for it to have fallen so far This will be my last flight with BA unless there are no other options available as BA is more expensive than its direct budget competitors and not a full service airline anymore.
I didnt even catch the flight. I was denied entry for being too late even though I had plenty of time to board. The staff at the counter said I should have been there four hours earlier. Their correspondences indicated no such thing. I have never missed a flight in my life but I wasnt alone. In the five minutes I stood in line at the help desk I met almost a dozen other people with the same issue. Im writing this from an airport lobby resting my head on my book bag preparing to sleep here for the night. Never ever fly this airline.
Never fly with this airline booked ticket for group. Airline cancelled this route 1 month back but they didnt inform us. Now we need to book alternative airline ticket cost gone high who will bear this additional cost. Now asking for Refund approx. 80k no response from airline side. Sent more than 10 emails no reply yet.
Had a terrible experience with loss of our luggage on this airline. We checked 5 bags and only received one on 12262022. The other four bags are missing and the airline is incapable or unwilling to locate them. They have been unresponsive and incompetent in handling our claim. Do not recommend flying this airline.
When I lived in Hong Kong Cathay was my favorite airline. The quality of meals and service have not advanced as far this year as Emirates Etihad and Turkish the airlines I have most used of late. But my biggest gripe with Cathay is with their customer service. I flew home to the US to care for ailing relatives. I had bought a very economical economy seat and I knew the ticket was nonrefundable and that there would be a fee should I have to extend my stay but the 650 Cathay wanted in order for me to change my return flight by one week was more than I paid for half my roundtrip ticket. I told their phone rep the familys medical reasons I needed to stay but it made no difference. When I suggested that I might as well look for a oneway flight cheaper than Cathays change fee she said only that I should call them if I wasnt going to use my ticket. Why I inquired. Theres no refund right. She replied that no there was no refund but that that would be the polite thing to do. Cathay Pacific has not been very polite to me. Never again Cathay.
Larnaca to London Heathrow via Athens. Efficient friendly service. Checkin at Larnaca was efficient and quick and all docs were checked with professionalism. Bags tagged all the way to Heathrow and boarding passes were given for both flights. Perfect onboard service as always for both flights. Would highly recommend this airline and would definitely choose them as my first choice when booking even if this involves a transfer at Athens International Airport. Well done Aegean Airlines.
Bangalore to Kochi. One of my most favorite flight is now AirAsia. All the flight and ground staff are so amazing good and polite. The most important thing for a passenger is the quick response for their queries. Its easy to connect with the representative and clarify everything which we require. Most attactive is the staff performance and dedication towards their job.
Worse customer service We had to rebook due to the virus and they charged us a 200.00 rebooking fee I Called and was told I had to email guest relations which I did I finally got a returned email stating that they will not return my rebooking fee do to I called them to rebook our flight because they dragged their feet on cancelling flights back in March today I received an email stating that the case is closed and I am still waiting for my flight refund Plus the rebooking fee I was told it will take up to 90days Ill never fly Silver AirWays this would have been my first flight with them and now its my last. I wanted to give them a zero in the rating but it wouldnt let me.
Fantastic journey. Flew on a Q400 turbo prop from Khartoum to Addis Ababa. They served a hot meal in economy on a turboprop 2 hr flight. From Addis Ababa to Kilimanjaro with a stop without deplaning in Zanzibar I also had great service in economy with a hot meal. The boarding procedure was very well organized and enforced by boarding zone. The A350 from Addis Ababa to JRO had a great inflight entertainment selection. Ethiopian is a terrific airline.
Cairo to Sydney via Dubai. Emirates dumped us with my children in the gate hall for 9 hours due to issues with plane and after 5 hours of conversations with their staff they started serving water and cheese sandwiches. On my next flight they have reselected the seating where I cannot set beside my 8 years son for a 14 hours flight after a long discussion they offered me a seat with my son in the front and my wife with my other son but in the back. I paid above the market price ticket to select the seats for my family where we can all sit together in this 14 hours trip. I issued a complaint and they said sorry thats really bad.
Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions although smaller are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service. Overall good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting.
Pyongyang to Beijing with Air Koryo. The departure and arrival were punctual staff smiling and friendly the aircraft including toilets was clean and there were magazines and newspapers at the entrance. The food was a chicken burger but the drink selection was rather limited either water or one type of soft drink. It is maybe not the most luxurious airline but the service for a shorthaul flight is better than European or American airlines I have used for the same distance.
My husband was traveling from Dubai to Delhi his flight was supposed to be on 1100 am which got delayed and scheduled at 600 pm. He waited there at the airport patiently and now they are asking him to reschedule his flight after 2 days or take total refund. Worst airline ever.
KULNRTORDBWI 21 September 2017. Last leg on UA as a codeshare. KULNRT on Y class due to absence of PY on this sector. Top marks for check in staff at KUL boarding done well and I was travelling with a wheelchair pax and everything was faultless. Cabin attendants were superb friendly and caring and fussed over my 83 year old mother who was travelling with me. Call bells were answered promptly and always politely. Each disabled pax was assigned a FA when deplaning to ensure that things ran smoothly. The downside food and entertainment were sub par. They have a funny mixed menu where even if you order a Western meal you get elements of Japanese food on your tray and vice versa. The IFE was lacking especially on the long NRTORD flight. The Y seats were tight and narrow and would have been uncomfortable for any journey longer than the 7 hours that it took to get to NRT. From NRTORD we had bulkhead window seats in a 242 configuration in PY which was okay. There was a leg rest but the drawback was that the screen was mounted on the wall. There was a reasonable amount of recline seats were wide but you could not stretch your feet out completely. Thats okay as it was not designed to be business class. We were given noise cancelling headsets slippers ear plugs and other amenities. Deplaning in ORD was fine and thankfully we had a lovely attendant who transported us from terminal 5 to terminal 1 for our UA flight. I would highly recommend ANA but please improve your IFE and sort out your menus.
I would like to say a big Thank you to Qatar Airways cabin crew for a job well done on the 7 8th of July You guys know what you are doing I fell sick on the plane and you attended to me in a a Godly way even the clinic staff I was taken to when we landed I salute you all may you all be blessed in special ways for me by God. Qatar Airways is the best way to go and I would recommend it anytime to anyone...100 percent
London Heathrow to Inverness. Having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with BA so far this summer I felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home I was rebooked on after shortnotice cancellation which I had to wait over a day for was also cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft. We were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go. Eventually got off the plane to utter chaos mixed messages being given by ground crew. Some people given details about rebooking others given nothing. Some people were sent texts with rebooking options others including me received nothing. Vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels however some people were only given one bus voucher meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day Some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told theyd have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers. Utterly appalling. Now Im hoping against hope I might make it home today 3 days after setting off
Truly the worst airline experience I have ever had and I fly a lot. The flight departed late and we were tight for our connecting flight which was another Turkish Airlines flight. Fine it happens. We informed cabin crew and they reassured us. We exited the plane and there were no staff to guide those of us connecting on where to go. There was a Short Connection path we could take but the Turkish Airlines staff member said it wasnt for Paris he was wrong. We walked around the vast Istanbul airport asking various Turkish Airlines employees for advice and it was unbelievable how rude unwilling to help they were. They literally would walk away from my wife and I saying Its not my job what can I do this happened multiple times. Obviously we missed our connecting flight and the follow up experience resolving this was equally awful their employees didnt seem to know where to tell us to go just pointing in vague directions to walk constantly pushing the problem off on one of their colleagues. I later witnessed their staff shouting at a lady who required a wheelchair be brought for her. It was shameful. My account only tells a bit of the nightmare experience we had with their airport staff. They are untrained impolite and unprofessional and I will never fly with them again.
Danang to Adelaide via Singapore. Our flight over to Vietnam was quite comfortable and good service however the return was quite different. My bag was severely damaged in transit from Danang to Singapore. I was given the run around at Changi by staff and have to hope that I can manage a damage claim via email. The Silk air flight which was code shared on SQ ticket was very average. Old plane the meal looked awful. Service was very rushed and impersonal. Singapore to Adelaide flight overnight no sleep due to extremely badly behaved child that screamed the whole time. Staff seemed oblivious and only intervened to talk to the parents when I requested them to do so. No food served until 5 hrs into the flight despite the fact everyone was awake due to screaming child. Drinks trolley never bought through. No snack service in galley like other flights do. Very disappointed. Food was average and service slow. I found it insulting that the IFE played a video showing all the features of the business class seat not once but twice a lovely reminder to those in cattle class what they are missing. New A350 has poor leg room and when the person in front reclined i could not bend my legs and had to keep them straightened under the seat in front. IFE very average. Wouldnt go out of my way to fly Singapore again.
Because of Turkish Airlines I had to waste hours of my vacation days. The service was horrible I was not listened to and I received a lot of wrong information. I am really not difficult but I found this very bad especially how Turkish Airlines now deals with my complaint. I wrote them a letter about my experience with their company and how badly everything went. From their responses I can already see that they have not even gone through my complaint and are not taking me seriously. The mistakes they made Change of flight with a layover of 26 hours. Incorrect change of data entered. Connection broke a few times during the call when you call back you get another colleague and you have to tell your story all over again. Was not listened to so they incorrectly redirected me. Due to their mistake I had to change the date again and the costs were charged to me I was told 4 different prices ranging from 130200 euros. I had to be present at the airport in Gazipasa at least 4 hours in advance to pay for my tickets and make sure my tickets would be in order without payment I had no guarantee for the tickets. My flight was at 4.15 am. I was present at 11.30 pm nobody from Turkish Airlines to be seen they arrived at 02.15. I had to wait hours for nothing in a lot of stress. Now that I have submitted a complaint I have already received 2 nonsense responses I am not taken seriously. I am far from satisfied this has been a real horror.
Milan to London. What a complete Mickey Mouse airline First of all the plane was old the ones with just 2 seats on either side the cabin crew were wearing a white tshirt blue jeans and white trainers this just doesnt look professional the whole point of a cabin crews uniform is that they stand out if there was an emergency Then when I get to London they lost my bag I didnt get in back until 2 days later as all my toiletries and make up was in it I was told to go out buy what I need and keep the receipts I went to Poundland and Superdrug to make it cheap for them even though all my make up was really expensive I sent the receipts in I got ignored for 6 weeks Then receive an email to tell me they wont be refunding me What an absolute joke I hope they go bust and they most likely will with this kind of customer service
Washington Dulles to Nairobi via London. Was excited to fly First Class on BA from Dulles to Nairobi since its about 15 hours of flying time I decided to splurge on a 1st Class ticket. Things started off poorly at checkin when BAs computer system went down a seemingly constant problem . After 45 minutes of waiting they were finally able to get a back up system going and I was checked in and off to their Lounge. Great meal and service there. My flying companion didnt want to splurge on a 1st Class ticket so she was in Business Class. It wasnt long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst shes seen. BA has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when youre asleep. Well I sprung for an 850 upgrade for her and all was well. Until the captain announced that there was an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart. Heres where BAs systems again breaks down and their computer isnt working to locate the bag in the hull. 3.5 hours later they locate the bag and we take off. We land 3 hours late at Heathrow and miss our connection to Nairobi No one to assist you head off to another terminal to customer service wait 3040 minutes in line to be told that they can put you on a Kenyan Air flight business class in 8 hours or you can wait til the next day and fly out on BA. We chose Kenya Airways and arrived the next morning without one checked bag. On our return flight I had booked a business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since I couldnt use my 1st class ticket. No cant do that and youll have to apply for a refund. Meanwhile they upgraded a couple of passengers gratis I was told later that that is promotional and to hell with a paying passenger. The bottom line is dont fly BA if you are going on to a distant location they are unreliable and assistance is negligible. If youre just flying on to the Continent where there are multiple flights you may make it.
Bagan to Heho. Very short flight again another ATR aircraft as a nervous passenger I was not looking forward to the flight but it was great. Seating was 22 no seat numbers given as only a few passengers on this flight. No Inflight snack but coffee or cold drinks were supplied. All in all a good flight and would travel again.
On June 27 I flew from Sacramento CA to Seattle to take Icelandair flight 680 to Iceland only to find out that the flight had been cancelled without me being notified. No flights back the same day so I had to rent a car to drive back to Sacramento about 14 hours. Vacation gone so no way of even contacting the airline. Customer number just a recording pointing you to one place or the other on their website. Icelandair is is the most dishonest company I have ever done business with.
Supposedly airplane issues was supposed to leave at 11.30 am didnt leave to 3.30pm missed my connection. Stuck in Orlando which is the opposite direction. Only to fly back the next morning. To Myrtle Beach to Boston and my luggage be stuck in Orlando. 48 hours without a change of clothes and no idea what is going on. They nickel and dime you for everything. Its cheaper at first but you get what you pay for. Second they get there money back. Worst flight of my life.
Do not fly JetBlue. They will absolutely screw you over and you will spend 10 hours of your time trying to talk to someone while stranded without any helpful information. We lost a lot of money. Will likely not fly again.
Absolute nightmare. They cancelled my 7am departing flight at 1am when I was sleeping. Wake up to the automated email notifying me they have automatically rebooked me on the same flight the next day. This doesnt work for me. Their chat is unavailable overnight so cant get a hold of anyone. Finally make it to my destination 9 hours later than supposed to after a whirlwind of a morning rescheduling hotel rental cars split off from the individuals I was travelling with and a direct flight from TO to Kelowna now takes me to Vancouver then Kelowna. The extra leg room and baggage I purchased with Swoop does not transfer over to my WestJet flight and there are no upgrade seats even available for me to purchase with WestJet. If I thought this couldnt get any worse the same thing happens a few days later on my return flight Same exact 1am email for a 7.30am flight I swear they were both automated and cancelled because the flights were not full. Again no support. I eventually arrive at my home destination 18 hours after originally expected again with a layover. Miss Superbowl with my family and friends and an extra day of work. I reach out to Swoop regarding compensation and they denied it. They were unsupportive throughout the entire process and I am not exaggerating when I say this was a living hell to experience. All I can say is thank god I was not travelling with small children at the time. I will never fly swoop again. I will always pay the extra dollar moving forward if it means I can just call someone on the phone. Swoop does not have a phone line and will take sometimes 45 minutes to an hour to respond to a simple question for help Save your sanity and dont fly Swoop. These guys need to be put out of business they are a joke of an operation.
Paris Orly to Punta Cana Dominican Republic with Air Caraibes and a very bad experience. 36 hours of delay. Very old and dirty plane and no inflight entertainment screen. The cabin crew were extremely unpleasant and Air Caraibes Customer service never answer to me. You have a number of your seat but when you arrive in the cabin crew just say you can sit where you want Crazy and it was unconfortable travel
Gatwick to Mauritius return. Absolutely fine from online check in baggage drop at Gatwick to collecting baggage in Mauritius. Allocated seats together 2 passengers given at online check in with no need to change these. Pleasant and courteous staff member at baggage drop. Boarding by cabin class and row numbers and ran pretty smoothly. Boeing 777 about 16 years old but still in presentable condition. Im 1.8 m. tall and medium build and I found the seat pretty comfortable for a 12hour flight in economy at least this aircraft type is still 9 abreast despite the slightly dated look of the cabin. Not the largest seat screen Ive experienced but fine and there was a reasonable selection of movies tv and music. Drinks service followed by hot meal roast chicken in sauce or veggie option. We ate in the terminal before departing just in case the food offering was going to be dire but despite the reduction in food given on the tray we couldnt really fault what was provided. Lights out after dinner until about an hour before landing when a hot breakfast was served. Cabin crew friendly and efficient service with water service through the night plus option to get drinks from the galley. Landed on time. Spent ages in the queue at immigration luggage waiting for us and then taxi to hotel. We got there safely on time and in reasonable comfort. Return flight a week later pretty much the same as outbound.
Algiers to Bangkok via Dubai. It was a fantastic experience from the check in until the air craft landed. Seats are very comfortable with large legroom the entertainment system was excellent with lot of choices.
Three flights scheduled with LAN Peru all problematic. First Lima to Puerto Maldonado on August 13. Left Lima 1 hour late. Explanation tire burst. Next Puerto Maldonado to Cuzco on August 15. A couple of hours after check in flight was cancelled due to mal tiempo en Cusco. At least LP took me to a hotel by bus paid for the room and gave me vouchers for dinner and breakfast. Next morning they took me to the airport and put me on a Tans Peru flight to Cuzco where the hotel and the travel agent both assured me there had been no bad weather the previous day. Finally Juliaca to Lima on August 20. An hour after check in flight was cancelled. LP refused to pay for hotel because we dont have the money. Never mind that most of the passengers were foreign tourists who had just come over from Puno and were unfamiliar with Juliaca. Next morning LP scheduled a special flight to Lima that left an hour late.
Terrible service. Just terrible. We had one visibly and understandably overworked crew attending to the entire economy class. Only one. She didnt have time for questions I asked twice for water and was completely ignored. If you were looking away for a minute she passed without offering you food or tea etc. They serve water right at the end when collecting dirty dishes so I was practically choking on my food as I dont drink juice they offered with food. No choice of beverage either just the juice packet you get in the food pack. Terrible inflight service
Brilliant...a bit shook up to be taken to a plane covered in Jet2 branding. Is this the right one Are we being kidnapped But the staff were super. The pilot sounded as annoyed as us passengers when he informed us that despite us all getting on board in very good time we may be delayed by 1h 15m presumably because other planes due to depart before us being delayed. He must have argued the case very well as we were only 35 minutes late taking off. It was also a 757 rather than a 737 which undoubtedly Jet2 would have used. This meant that once up in the air it became apparent there was lots of empty rows. Anyone that fancied a kip could get themselves a row and bed down for the flight. Only downside was none of the cabin crew stood in for Jess Glynn and sang Come And Take My Hand. The end of holiday experience just missed that little touch. Many thanks for fetching us home though Titan.
Emirates switched our airplane with absolutely no notice to any passengers. Entire business class cabin is furious as moved from 222 new seats airplane to old 232 configuration where families and couples have been split up and all kinds of Covid infractions are happening. Crew says this happens all the time and people are always mad. Probably a dodgy cost save that puts people at risk. Far from the ritzy commercials you see this is a second rate business class experience at best. Try and book elsewhere.
Frankfurt to Singapore. Singapore Airlines again demonstrated why it is the best airline. The flawless crew was always offering food and drinks during the whole flight and always ready to do anything to make your flight great. The food is the best Ive ever had on a flight the IFE was just brilliant and the overall quality of the aircraft was perfect. Legroom and recline angle were exceptional. Simple details as the hot towel after takeoff and before landing make this airline special. Skytrax 5 stars well earned.
Bad service and attitude all round. My fiasco was when my flight from London was cancelled due to failure of their systems. BA refused to rebook us at the airport instead made to wait over an hour on the phone to customer services which resulted in us being routed to Milan via Madrid a day later. BA are now dragging their heels over reimbursing me travel food and refreshment costs. We were stranded at the airport no help to find a hotel zero customer care or empathy. Premium prices for a Ryanair style service.
Barcelona to Prague with CSA Czech Airlines. The flight went smoothly with a lot of information provided at all times. However there is very little room between rows and the plane was a bit dated.
I booked to go to Thailand on the 161221 From Manchester but my wife had a positive covid test so we couldnt fly. I have been trying to get in touch with Singapore Airlines but I am just being ignored. Tried phoning the help line but gave up after 1 34 hours. I booked directly with the airline in case something like this happened but it hasnt made any difference.
London to Cape Town. Galleries lounge at T3 tatty and overcrowded. Takeoff delayed by an hour because of weather issues but we were kept well informed while waiting for push back. Seats 62JK on upper deck excellent for a couple although the plane was looking its age with patching up wherever you looked. IFE long past its due replacement date with small screen and poor resolution. Cabin crew friendly enough. Meal the usual substandard BA fare with diminishing portion sizes and overcooked mains. Hotel Chocolat chocs have now disappeared. Arrival at CPT only 30 mins behind schedule. Cape Town to London the Galleries lounge at CPT spacious but quickly became packed with pax from two flights. Food options dreadful with the worst hot food weve encountered in any business class lounge. Cheese prepackaged. MCC available but no champagne. Push back 15 mins ahead of schedule. Same seats on upper deck. Meal barely average and we avoided the hot option at breakfast. Arrived ahead of schedule. Overall the flight itself was the usual BA service. Onboard was another matter with seats and service way below BAs competitors and at inflated prices.
Prague to Denver via London. I almost missed my flight because at checkin I had to complete some really important papers that took 40 minutes later no one asked me for those papers. Flight to Heathrow was average what you expect from a 2 hour flight. At Heathrow the security lasted me 30 minutes. When I boarded the next the plane a lack of leg room it was less than the flight before. The flight then was pretty much okay the food was delicious had pasta with tomato sauce and several times drinks the flight staff was kind and helpful. But the plane had no paid WiFi no outlets or USB ports the screens were low quality.
Prague to Tel Aviv. If you are traveling to Israel avoid el al up . Questioning for 1.5 hours treating passengers like theyre criminals bad service. Will never fly again with them. Avoid anything with them. I dont wish this experience to anybody. Do yourself a favor and take any other airline.
The crew was very nice and attentive food was good and enough. The wine selection was also good and the Port was excellent. The seat was comfortable and the on board entertainment good. There was no wifi. But for a price tag of a little over 2000 Euros this was a nice flight. I will fly with them again.
Very small seat and spaces around. My 7 hour journey was like confined in a small box unable to stretch my legs in front or rear horrible seating arrangements. This airline should be avoided at any cost. Poor food grumpy faces of air hostesses and late departure. Never ever recommended.
I had no delays or cancelations everything went smoothly and the staff was friendly. I worried that Id have a bad experience based on other reviews so I wanted to be sure to include a positive one on here.
I flew business class Sydney to Tianjin. Seat is 222 layout only 3 rows which is a lot less busy than many airlines J class. Seat comfort good no privacy screens flat bed you never bump your legs to the side board. Pajamas is provided and amenity is Clarins. Food i will give 3.5 due to a lack of speciality. Entertainment is 35 due to a lack of choice. The cabin crew decent patient and polite. Lounge at Sydney is Skyteam lounge
Cairo to London. At Mansoura Egyptair Office I paid more than 10000 egyptian pounds to change the date of my and my wifes tickets since the imminent suspension of airports because of Corona virus. Despite saying that changing travel dates is free the staff were playing games and bargaining with customers to charge the largest amount if money. Initially they denied any economy seats left and asked for 23000 eg pounds per seat i.e. 46000 for 2 seats business class for only to change the travel date. When I complained to the manager I found out that there are many economy seats and asked to pay over 10000 per ticket i.e. over 20000. After arguing this was reduced to 10056 Egyptian pounds which I had no choice but to pay. This is illegal since the closure of the airports was the government decision and not a mind change. This is giving the company and the country bad name. I come across tens of angry passengers who would never recommend Egyptair to anyone. This is sad situation at a time other companies are helping their passengers.
A timewarp experience to say the least my flight from Beijing to Pyongyang was without hitch although youd be hard pressed to find a team less interested in not only the well being but the safety of the passengers. For example when the purser was meant to make the safety announcement she looked around and saw a flight full of foreigners. As a result she actually shrugged rolled her eyes and sat right back down instead of briefing us. That it was a 30 year old Tupolev made that nagging feeling of I should probably listen to the safety announcement in case I jinx the flight all the more pressing. That said the flight was a dream. The plane felt so heavy we barely realised we were touching down. The food was passable but the experience was unforgettable. Our seats tilted forwards rather than backwards. But for a 2 hour flight the sense of wonder far outweighs any actual discomfort. The stewardesses seemed more interested in reapplying thick strata of foundation and redoing their 60s overdone hairstyles than actually serving their passengers but the sight was certainly more entertaining than the sad slightly desperate propaganda movies played throughout the flight. My Air Koryo flight was a tremendous start to my trip.
Amsterdam to Istanbul. We expect more from Turkish Airlines. I was at Amsterdam airport. The staff of Turkish airlines was rude told me I cannot bring my laptop bag and a cabin suitcase inside the airplane People were bringing 3 bags and luggage inside the airplane but no one told them it is wrong The airplane from Amsterdam to Istanbul did not have a front monitor. The internet inside the airplane did not work. The flight attendants were not really friendly they were just polite and strict.
Was unable to find much about this airline in terms of reviews except that it is a subsidiary of Hainan Airlines. My family and I flew with them today from Chengdu to Lijiang China. First impressions of the A319 were good. Aircraft looked reasonably new and was clean. We had fine weather flying across the mountains to Lijiang which made the flight quite comfortable. Was on time leaving and arriving.
Jakarta to London via Dubai. This is the first time I took Emirates and definitely my last. Boarding began from Jakarta and the ground staff was courteous. Inflight I dont really expect much because the cabin crew is generally not willing to go out of their way to get you your cup of coffee especially on a busy morning flight. The cabin looks and feel tight though I am neither tall nor fat. The seats It isnt worth commenting. Landing in Dubai for the transit to London expect the usual UAE approach. Their ground service is next to zero. The Emirates lounge is big but not fantastic its overcrowded if anything. Boarding my flight to London was ok but once onboard again do not expect good service. Some cabin crew try to smile thats about as good as you can get. Once the plane is cruising they go on their switchoff mode chitchat etc more than they are willing to serve. Wifi and sleeping are about the only things that can keep you sane inside this flight. Needless to say upon arrival to London and once Im comfortably checked into my hotel room I dumped the return leg for an SQ one. Emirates my foot.
NUEAYT charter in November14 Very nice flight altogether. Charter flight but the last one of the season so plane almost empty. Cabin crew fairly relaxed and joking around a bit. Plane seemed in good condition and clean. Overhead LCD displays every few rows with basic entertainment enough for the 3 hr flight. The cheese roll snack was absolutely inedible but I did not mind. Plenty of free drinks which were served multiple times by the crew.
Avianca I traveled to Colombia from Canada a 6hour flight one way on an 320 and back on an A319. I paid 1150 dollars and they dont give a drop of water the seats are super uncomfortable. Avianca viaje a Colombia desde Canada un vuelo de 6 horas a la ida en un A320 y de regreso en A319. Pague 1150 dollares y no dan ni una gota de agua los puestos super incomodos. Es el colmo con esta compania como abusa de sus usuarios. Invito a no volar con ellos
YYZDMEKBP return. Online checkin for flight out worked fine some issues on return flight but quickly resolved. Food was acceptable cabin staff were terrific with good language skills in both Russian and English. Minor time delays on return flight but not fault of airline.
I had flight from Istanbul to Goa but one day before flight company changed time of flight and in the end plane also was late and I lost my next two flights. I was at first in this kind of situation didnt know how to get next flights and whats is with luggage. In this chaos between offices and departments in airport I lost my baggage tags. There were two suitcases. Qatar provided next flight but with delay 20 hours which I spent in airport without any complaining and compensation. During my awaiting time they found just one of my suitcases and told me to fill application about lost luggage in final destination for second one and promised that it will be delivered during 23 days Any worries from my side I get used to trust people especially company with so high renting. I filled application for lost luggage after my arriving to Goa but they didnt provide PIR code. More then 2 weeks they found nothing.
Unfortunately here to share a negative experience with Air Canada. I flew out from Toronto YYZ to Fort Lauderdale FLL on June 22 2022 Flight 1628. To begin with as sprawling as Pearson Airport is the signage is lacking and honestly not clear at all so it was extremely confusing to figure out exactly where we needed to go just to check in for our specific flight. Air Canadas ground customer service was painfully slow and inefficient I get there are staffing shortages with the pandemic aftermath but this was a little excessive. Our flight boarded a few minutes behind schedule which wasnt the end of the world but we were scheduled to take off at 4.45pm and did not take off until almost 7.00pm All of us literally sat on the tarmac going nowhere for over 2 hours The cabin crew was essentially clueless and the pilot kept giving one excuse after another for the delay which didnt even make sense. Every passenger was pretty agitated about the situation to say the least...we finally took off way behind schedule and did not make it into Fort Lauderdale until almost 10.00pm original landing time was 7.45pm. The flight itself was OK. At least on AC Rouge I found the legroom to be mediocre and the seating marginally comfortable. Flight attendants were generally polite but not necessarily friendly. Overall this is my second experience flying Air Canada. My first time was in 2015 going tofrom Montreal and I also dealt with poor customer service then so I should have learned my lesson but I hope this cautions other potential fliers to avoid Air Canada if at all possible especially if your travel plans are not flexible or if you need to catch a connecting flight
Our family booked together and having flown for many years on Qatar Airways expected that the family will be seated together. To our surprise we we each seated in different middle seats including our child. The check In counter person was so rude when we asked to check if they can find an aisle seat since one of us needs it for health reason. We are so dissatisfied with the service. We have never encountered this kind of a situation in our 25 years of flying international.
Paris to Goa via Doha on 2nd May. DepartureArrival is from our local airport and food free baggage allowance. Poor service by crew on board and the meal service was below expectations the portion size left me still hungry. I tried to get the attention of the stewardess to ask for more bread each time she walked past but was ignored being too far away in my window seat. This in spite of the fact that my call light was on for well over 45 minutes. Finally managed to ask for bread when they came to collect the trays The service takes a long time in coming and when it does they serve the drinks and meals in a single pass and dont come back to ask if youd like your drink refreshed. Surely they can manage to serve an aperitif first so that passengers can relax while waiting for crew to get the meals ready. For the quick snack before landing we were served a puff pastry roll with some spicy chicken filling. The filling was okay the pastry terrible. The standard 3x3x3 seat configuration means that window seat passengers are 2 seats away from the aisle. As a result I was forced to remain in my seat without visiting the rest room for hours as I did not wish to inconvenience the passengers seated beside me until one decided to take a walk himself. The reason we have so far continued to fly with Qatar Airways is the convenience of flying direct to our end destination without necessitating an overnight hotel stay.
Condor has changed the carrier at the last minute they always do they are now basically a ticket reseller for cheap airlines by using the cheap airline carrier SmartLynx for an intercontinental flight. We paid our Premium Economy ticket over Eur 800 one way and after they subcontracted the flight to SmartLynx they were selling economy tickets at 400 Eur. Needless to say that Premium Economy was not available with SmartLynx and we were ripped off by Eur 400 x 2 persons. No refund from Condor whatsoever. This airline is on the brink of insolvency and they are ripping off customers to try to stay in business. Do not book with them they are doing this as standard procedure. Needless to say that the Smartlynx cheap carrier was the worst intercontinental flight of my whole life. Letting fly a cheap European carrier an intercontinental flight is plain criminal. Think about flying Ryanair from Dominican Rep to Europe. Stay million miles away from Condor.
Had refundable business class tickets to Israel on El Al in February 2023. Unfortunately due to health issues we had to cancel. El Al told us we would get our refund in 69 weeks. We received all other refunds on hotels tours and museums within days. When the 9 weeks passed without getting the refund we called and were told our issue was being sent to billing and at a minimum we would get a status email if not payment in 2448 hours. When we received nothing we called again and spoke to a supervisor who can only say our claim is a priority. When we asked to speak to his manager he said he was the highest level English speaking supervisor and since we dont speak Hebrew there was nobody else to talk to. Issue is still not resolved
Seville to Vienna. I was lucky enough to fly with Lauda two times. Firstly it was delayed with 45 minutes than at the way to home more than 70 minutes. Also with the extra charges of the bags if you do not buy extra luggage it is only allowed to bring a small cabin bag it became almost the same as Ryanair. Bad experience I do not recommend it. But at least the staff is friendly.
Washington to Saint Petersburg via Paris CDG. The airline got us from point A to point B but not without some trouble. The lines at Washington were very long. It took about 30 minutes to drop off our bags even though we checked in online and were at Washington nearly 3 hours before departure. The flight to Paris CDG was late and made us miss our connection to Saint Petersburg. That made us miss our train to the final point the last one that night and required us to purchase hotel stay and overall extended the trip by over 12 hours. This should not happen when both flights are operated by the same airline.
Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai. Flight entertainment out of this world and the food was amazing. I love the look in the aircraft as well. Cabin service was good but ground service was terrible especially in Gatwick Airport. Staff were unfriendly and not helpful at all. Another thing is that the inconvenient online booking system of Emirates. we are a family of 4 1 of us must be booked separately because of extra baggage weight which lead to we cannot check in together. Furthermore we successfully checked in online for the first 3 of us but another family member with the separated booking cannot check in online due to overbooked flight. Therefore we went to the counter to check in and they gave us 4 new seats including the other 3 of us who checked in online earlier with already selected seats. Also we got new seats without being informed. Also almost all the seats are taken during 47 hours before departure for our return flights I wonder why. In overall I would still recommend flying with Emirates because of the inflight entertainment system and in flight comfortably not to mention the A380.
Gatwick to Dar es Salaam via Kigali. We had a very good experience with Rwandair new plane ample seats and leg room all drinks were free including alcohol and staff were friendly and polite. On baggage checkin a novice member of Gatwicks baggage handling staff accidentally pressed the button to send one of our suitcases onto the conveyor belt without any tags or labels on it. Disaster we thought but were reassured that it would very quickly be found. After several enquiries as to its whereabouts we found ourselves at the gate about to board still without the missing case. We didnt want to board the plane knowing it was here at Gatwick but were approached and reassured by staff that he would make it his personal mission to find the case. He gave us his card and we decided that email would be the best method of contact. We arrived in Dar es Salaam where we had an email from him saying he hadnt yet found the case our hearts sank as we felt there was little chance of finding it. We had one night in Dar then caught the ferry over to Zanzibar where we spent another night in Stonetown. That morning he emailed us to say that the case had been found sent on the first available flight to Dar to then be forwarded by air to Zanzibar airport where it would be arriving at 4pm that afternoon. We couldnt believe it So thank you Rwandair we have sung your praises since coming back home because it was the personal touch that set you aside from other reputable airlines. We would very much enjoy flying with you again and would highly recommend this airline to anyone considering it. No need to worry theyre brilliant go ahead and book it.
There was a delayed departure from Edinburgh airport to Cologne of 2h and 30 min which obviously led to lose my connecting flight to Thessaloniki. I sent an email to ask the compensation of the tickets since the arrival to my final destination was 12h after the original one since I lost the connection flight and this led to stay in Cologne airport without receiving any refreshments from the airline no accommodation to sleep absolutely nothing. When I arrived to Thessaloniki I sent an email to the company asking for compensation and they replied to my email 8 months later and they said that am not eligible for compensation of the tickets because the delay it was due to unforeseen circumstances which was outside of their control. I will advice anyone who is going to consider Eurowings for their flight to think twice not to mention three times since the customer service is appalling reply after 8 months from the initial claim is an absolute joke and not accepting to refund for the significant delay when you are eligible for it is an absolutely disgrace.
Edinburgh to Phuket via Doha. Great entertainment comfy seats and great staff all ruined by terrible bland food. Im a celiac sufferer so have to be on a glutenfree diet. Even though each flight had at least one dish that would traditionally be gluten free I was served a specific gf meal with bland steamed vegetables and dry chicken. The only words to describe this food is terrible even by plane food standards. Considering how nice this other dishes looked this was extremely disappointing.
Vancouver to London Heathrow. I was booked on Air Canada but rebooked onto British Airways as I was unable to make the AC flight since AC cancelled an earlier flight from YYJ to YVR. Having flown British Airways in the past I was looking forward to flying them again but my trip was somewhat disappointing. Seat on the Boeing 747 not the most comfortable but still a slightly bit better than on Air Canadas 10 across Boeing 777300ER. Meal served after takeoff was chicken with rice it was fairly tasteful. Cabin crew seemed approachable but after the meal service cabin crew disappeared and made very limited appearances during the 9.5 hr flight to London. I wanted a glass of water and had to push the call button then waited over 15 minutes until a cabin crew walked by. Before landing breakfast was served consisting of a tasteless pretzel bun and granola bar. It is very evident that BAs service standard has slipped considerably since I last flew with them in 2013. How the mighty have fallen.
Singapore to Sydney return on a British Airways fifth freedom route. Boarding for the outgoing flight BA15 from Singapore was a bit disorganised and there was congestion on the aerobridge. On board the aircraft had an airconditioning problem so the cabin was quite warm. Seats were fairly comfortable with a fairly narrow seat pitch and the entertainment selection was fairly good. Bar service commenced 30 minutes after departure. The chicken main meal was pretty good but would have preferred dinner to be served 1 hour and not 2 hours into the flight. Prior to arrival I received a snack box which contained a really bad sandwich granola bar and some yoghurt. Cabin crew didnt offer a regular drinks service on this flight. Return flight to Singapore BA16 was a notch better boarding in Sydney was done in a more efficient manner. Bar and main meal service was quicker although evidence of BAs cost cutting can be seen as theyve now removed cheese and crackers from the main meal. Cabin crew did do two rounds of drinks service on this flight and were more attentive. Good sandwich for the snackdinner service before arrival. Late departures on both flights but arrivals into Sydney and Singapore were on time. Still good to note they provide toothbrushes even during day flights. Very satisfied with this BA flight and service especially when their full service competitors charge around 40 more on Sydney flights and budget challengers arent up to the mark with the price and service.
Doha to Dubai via Kuwait. The most horrible customer service and airline ever. It is a scam. I purchased the ticket from Expedia and I didnt realize that no baggage was allowed my fault. I would have never imagined that no baggage was allowed because of the high price. They forced me to pay QR 140 for the extra baggage and QR 50 per kg each way. When you calculate the cost of the flight plus the the extra baggage it ends up a lot more expensive than a prime 5 star airline. Instead I got this cheap airline for a lot more.
My biggest complaint is that they only provided a 10 minute window for boarding. There was a last minute gate change. Im sure that they announced the gate change because there were announcements in both German and French. I missed out on the information about the last minute gate change. When I noticed that the next flight was going to Morocco I knew something was wrong so I looked at the departures and rushed to the correct gate. When I got there the doors were already closed. They rebooked me into a middle seat in regular economy. My original booking was premium economy. They claimed that there were no seats available in premium economy but I saw that there were. I had to pay for my own hotel room because the next flight available was for the next day. I complained to the airline and they basically said how unfortunate it must be to be me. They wont do anything.
The customer support of Jetstar Asia is the absolute worst. The only way you can add baggage is by calling their number. This alone costs me more than 130 euros because their employees are unqualified for their job. The only way you can pay is by credit card. After using my credit card for this it took only a week before my credit card was fraudulent so that I could no longer use my credit card on vacation and had to apply for a new credit card. The airplane was too cold and stank. Overall the worst experience Ive ever had.
From Fuerteventura to Dusseldorf on TUIfly I was returning home after a short holiday in January with my wife and children. Check in was messed up and the staff at the airport dont understand German or English. Boarding the plane was chaos as the crew did not greet people as normal. The plane was new and the seats was not comfortable. The crew was not helpful. There is no food and beverages as well as entertainment onboard even. I will never fly with TUIfly again.
Cape Town to Luanda. Its a shame to see new wellspaced between seats airplanes being treated so badly and so poorly maintained. The staff are rude and the movies in the entertainment system are the same since 2014. On this flight the entertainment system did not work and despite complaints the staff did not even restart the system. I only travel with them because there is no alternative from Luanda.
Poor service with customers. I booked 2 tickets in February and March. The company canceled the flights and sent emails automatically. No clear information or explanation. I tried many times to contact the callcenter of the air company to get more information about the flight and discuss the schedule but no answer. I sent an email immediately but replied after 2 months without detailed information. I have been waiting for a refund for 3 months. This is my first time to face such as poor service and no respect for customers.
London to Istanbul on 13 February. One of most rubbish and rude customer services. Our flight had 12 hours delay and when I claim for compensation for first few days and weeks tried to play the game and when they did find I am serious they start offering. And after except their offer they start playing gave to give me the cheque. Several times I called them and they pretended not hearing my voice but clearly you can understand they are pretending. I am really sorry for people who spending their money for this rubbish airline.
I paid extra for hand luggage bag and front seat. Still no space to put bag overhead. When asked the crew he was useless and as discourteous as he could. Just pointed me to plane asking to look for space.
Stansted to Derry. They often cancel or delay flights and no customer service. Call centre only open basic office hours and not when you need to speak to someone. 60 daty average response time to emails and no help at the airport. No real people or staff to assist. Worst airline ever booked with.
Yangon to Mandalay with Golden Myanmar Airlines was very pleasant and positive. The airline online booking system was good checkin counter staff very friendly and the checkin was easy. The flight left the gate as per schedule and the flight was comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Passengers were served with light snacks during the approx. 1.5 hrs flight.
Amsterdam to Paramaribo. Surinam Airways has good service unfortunately the A340300 had some maintenance so they leased an A330 from Wamos Air but they have the service from Surinam Airways. The food was amazing with 2 hot meals. The crew was very friendly but the airplane from Wamos Air wasnt so good no IFE for a 9 our flight you can download the app for movies no power outlets just a standard seat with table. Overall the service was good but the aircraft not.
Milan to Toronto. At Milan Airport you have to stay in a line which moves very slowly to get your boarding pass. If you like to check in online I believe you have to pay a fee.
Check in was easy and the flight left on time. Staff were friendly and helpful. The toilet unfortunately could have been a bit cleaner. Food was limited to snacks for purchase and the only drinks offered were tea coffee and water. Overall a pleasant flight.
BA006 19th May 2015. Awful premium economy service bad old cabin with faulty inflight entertainment and they even split my wife and I up when travelling back from Japan how is that acceptable
Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent simultaneously. He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldnt be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline we lost 1000 from cancelling the new tickets. Now the representative claimed that he never said there wont be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action and that other arrangements will be made if there were any issues this was new information never given to us before. We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to checkin 15 hours before take off we found that our VAN LHR flight was cancelled due to the bad weather in Vancouver. We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight to which they offered rebooking with an additional 7001000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled we had to pay about 1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out the customer service person would take 1520 minutes for real to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for.
Dublin to London City. I booked expensive flight due to family emergency. My return flight has been changed from London City to Southend. Reason given is staff shortages. This is most inconvenient and not what they advertise. No response from cityjet or offer of compensation. Never again.They continually brag about flying you into heart of London. Southend is certainly not that
Air Busan was what I would expect from a LCC. Seat pitch a little tight but enough for me. Flight attendants a little abrasive but you cant judge an airline by one flight attendant Overall good airline and it serves its purpose well affordable no frills flying so that is what you should expect. South Korea is small so flights with Air Busan are only in the 1 hour range
New York to Dhaka via Istanbul. Services at Istanbul Airport was horrible and totally unprofessional. I had a flight from JFK to Istanbul on the way to Dhaka and had a 12hour long stay over in Istanbul. While it was written on the Turkish website that they would give a hotel room if the stay over is 12 hours or more there was no such opportunity. Turkish airlines staff at the airport had limited English proficiency lack of decency rude and lower motivation to cooperate. However instead of a hotel room a lady at the counter offered me snacks. When I requested for lunch instead of snacks or breakfast the lady just tore the check she wrote in front of me. I was devastated seeing this nonprofessional rudeness. Only positive things were inflight hospitality and foods.
The crew were very helpful and extremely supportive. The entertainment screens have a lot of options. Comfortable chairs even for long trips in economy class. Food was amazing.
Gatwick to Madeira. The flight left on time and arrived early slept as early morning flight. The plane was not very clean grubby tray between seats and ingrained dirt in the spokes of the seats. The staff were pleasant. Breakfast was offered and my children felt it was adequate. The return was poorly organised no use of fast track security for business class passengers. Long queue for boarding and a grubby plane. Really no point in paying for business class. The staff try so very hard to please the passengers but nearly 4 hours and no entertainment dogeared magazines. Quickly disembarked and swiftly through immigration.
Mauritius to Dubai. Checkin was easy and also enjoyed priority immigration and security. Emirates uses the Air Mauritius lounge and the lounge offered better than expected services. Inflight the flight attendants seemed to treat passengers with genuine hospitality for the first time felt that the bar at the back of business class cabin was a good place to relax. The food was great and good wine selections. The business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people including myself and the inflight Internet offering is far from satisfactory. Inflight Internet could be purchased at 16.99 for a 6hour flight excluding takeoff and landing the Internet would only be provided for 4 hours at most and streaming would still be blocked.
Both flights PEKGYD and GYDLHR were on new Boeing 787 with 333 seating. BeijingBaku flight was full and I was randomly allocated seat 21C on the front row of the rear section so I had no trouble at all with legroom. BakuLondon flight was about threequarters empty so I had plenty of space to lie across the row of three seats 23A. The seats themselves are fairly comfortable for economy class. The attendants on the first flight were particularly friendly and attentive although I have no particular complaints about those on the second leg. The meals were very good on both flights although I had requested a vegetarian meal out of slight preference rather than insistence which was not available. While this was not a huge disadvantage for me personally it will have been a problem for more resolute vegetarians. My main criticism is the lack of content on the entertainment system. The interface works very well but there was no interesting material to watchlisten to. I had a long layover in Baku but the airport itself is outstanding nice modern design clean efficient sofas to sleep and chargers. I did not buy anything at the airport since I heard it would be overpriced and I do not know if this is true or not.
Turkish Airlines cannot keep track of baggage. I was warned before flying that there was a chance I would lose my bags and I hoped that their systems had improved and lo and behold I lost a bag on both segments of my trip. On my way home Turkish delayed my flight so I missed my connection. I ask the officials at IST multiple times to ensure that my bag would be on my new flight and they delivered false promises that it will be delivered. Losing a bag is a major inconvenience that the airline seems to very callously gloss over in their customer service. If flying with Turkish Airlines I advise carrying all important items in hand luggage or simply not flying with them at all.
Bangkok to Houston via Tokyo. Fantastic Airline. First time flying with ANAI was truly impressed. The checkin process Bangkok was fast it took a about 5 minutes. The ground crew was courteous and helpful. The economy leg room was fine for me 58. Seat was fairly comfortable. In flight service was exceptional. A snack before the first of 2 meals for a 12.5hr flight. Im a vegan so I elected for the fruit platter for my meals. Fruit was fresh. Plenty of restrooms available and all were spacious and clean. Ive flown many Asian carries over the years and I can say this was the best so far. I can see why ANA is rated as 5 star. I would recommend ANA to anyone. Will definitely travel with them again.
Worst experience ever with an airline when It comes to hassles and changes. Flights from KL to Langkawi delayed. I received an email whilst at the airport getting ready to check in saying delayed. My original return flight from Langkawi to KL was cancel and we were bumped back over 2 hrs to a later flight. Then that flight was delayed after we checked in. Then to add insult to injury the Air Asia flight going to KL that was scheduled for a later departure ended up flying out before my earlier flight. Then if you try to lodge a complaint about the service it is all virtual response now. Seriously such lousy service and terrible airline. I truly regret booking with Air Asia. Next time I will look for any other airline before I ever book with Air Asia again.
Bangkok to Koh Samui. The landing gear wouldnt go down so we couldnt land and had to return to Bangkok. After waiting in line for 45 minutes got a ticket for a free meal that the cafeteria wouldnt accept. 6 hour delay. Dealing with customer service on email is a waste of time and only a local Thai number to call.
Today when I went to check in I realized I had made a mistake in my booking. I had booked the wrong date. I explained the situation to the ground staff and was instructed that there wouldnt be a penalty and was given a phone number. However the company provided no mercy and pointed to the small print which says there is no refund. Customer support didnt care but just pointed to their policy. In addition to change the date I will incur further penalties. This is the worst example of customer care I have experienced.
Mumbai to Doha on a Boeing 777. On this flight we had the QSuite configuration. The seat hardware blows away all the competition. The comfort and space is closer to the First Class seating found on many other airlines. I havent seen Singapore or Cathay Business in recent years Qatars closest competition but I dont think either has anything like the seats of QSuite. Even the lavatory design is outstanding. Qatars inflight service is very good but I would rank Lufthansa Swiss and ANA a notch higher in this department. Where Qatar fell short is at the Al Mourjan Business Lounge in Doha. Physically it is an impressive space. However during the morning peak hour it transforms into a bus station with all the unpleasantness that goes with it. It is surprising that Qatar hasnt thought through this as well as the energies they have put into their inflight product. We had to stand outside for 15 mins for a shower and the restaurant upstairs was packed to the gills with many turned away due to lack of seating space.
I was travelling from Istanbul to Bangkok with my husband after attending our wedding. When we arrived at the airport we were told that the flight had been overbooked and we were being downgraded to economy. Since the staff were aware we were travelling for a special occasion they kindly bought us a cake on the first flight ISTBAH thanks to the airport manager at IST for kindly arranging this. The second flight from ISTBKK stopped over in Singapore but the staff at checkin and the crew on the plane didnt really have any clue about the arrangements for this as if they had no idea it was happening. Upon arriving in BKK our final destination our luggage did not arrive. It contained many items close to our hearts ... wedding gifts cards written by family and friends photos and memories that cannot be replaced. Gulf air customer service is a nightmare and they seem totally unwilling to help I am trying to trace the baggage myself by calling the various airlines and talking to the ground services directly. I will not be flying Gulf Air again. Service is okay in Business class but could definitely be better same goes with the lounge in BAH. Inflight entertainment is a joke you have a choice of about 3 films.
Birmingham to Cape Town via Istanbul and Durban. BHX to IST a comfortable B737800 with fairly good leg space. Food was okay. Cabin crew werent very enthusiastic. IFE was a bit difficult to work as touch screen wasnt very responsive. Choice of movies was okay. Was shocked to see many passengers get up to collect their cabin luggage while plane was still taxiing on arrival in Istanbul and cabin crew did nothing except tell them to sit down over the speaker. Istanbul to Cape Town via Durban a new A330300 much better IFE although seat would not recline and very uncomfortable for a 12 hour flight to CPT including a 1 hour layover in Durban. Fortunately we did not have to disembark in Durban. Food quality was the same as previous flight. Appreciated the amenities toothbrush socks.etc given on this long haul flight as this is not always provided for on other airlines. Cabin crew friendlier on this sector. Flight was punctual on arrival in CPT. Return flight CPTIST via Durban on an A330300. More experienced crew and friendlier than previous flights. Same food quality and almost exactly same menu. IST to BHX on a B737800. Boarding was disorganized and painfully slow which caused a slight delay in the flight. Lack of adequate airport facilities at Istanbul a contributing factor. Same breakfast served as on previous flight. Overall not a great experience but considering it was cheapest ticket available I accept the outcome. Service and product quality nowhere near as advertised. Food menu was repetitive on all flight and cabin crew not always professional with not very fluent English.
Not bad if you can find a flight at the right price point. Return flight ARNDXB via Riga. Okay lets get the worse thing out of the way one toilet for a 7.20 hour flight does not make the grade. On the positive side. All flights were on time. Equipment is new. Both check in and cabin staff were better than average and price was exceptional compared with the premium carriers. No luggage police were on duty unlike Ryanair. Seats a tad uncomfortable for the duration but reasonable legroom. Would recommend and book again
I was a victim of Peruvian Airlines too. On March 20 2016 there was an aborted takeoff of a Peruvian Airlines flight 218 in Cuzco. All flights in and out where cancelled. Peruvian Airlines did not communicate anything to us. Peruvian Airlines checked is in and took our baggage for our flight late in the afternoon despite having delayed most previous flights that day. Our flight never made it to any departure board or gate sign. All announcements were in Spanish only and very few Peruvian Airlines customer service reps spoke enough English to answer questions. When we were able to find someone to communicate with we received incorrect information. We were basically left on our own to follow masses of people running from one place to another as instructed in Spanish. To make a 21 hour long story shorter after waiting a day in the Lima airport Peruvian Airlines ended up sending people to hotels for a couple hours with instructions to be back at the airport at 230 300 or 330am depending upon which Peruvian Airlines representative you talked to. Peruvian airlines could not find our luggage so we had to make due Most people did manage to get their bags. Peruvian Airlines promised two additional flights for a 430am departure. We stood in line for another 5.5 hours and finally had a boarding pass with a departure time in the past you can imagine my scepticism. We finally make it to Cuzco in the afternoon of the second day. One might give Peruvian Airlines a pass for poor contingency planning in the event of an aborted takeoff but five days later we had a similar experience with Peruvian Airlines on the return trip. Another day spent in the airport flights delayed multiple times poor communication from Peruvian airlines. Our connecting flight on another carrier was missed after 3 delays of our Peruvian Airlines flight. I am now in waiting in an airport lounge on Easter Sunday my family back in the US. Thank you Peruvian Airlines Fortunately United Airlines was able to change my return flight without any additional penalty. Unfortunately there isnt anything anyone can do to compensate me for lost time and stress. I will never fly Peruvian Airlines again. If you do consider yourself fairly warned and plan for an additional day on each end of your travel dates.
Tashkent to Kuala Lumpur. The worst airline taken in all of my holidays. A week before we departed Singapore they sent an email to inform that flights home to Singapore are cancelled. We wrote in 3 times with no reply called the Singapore office and the guy was impossibly unhelpful. We had no choice but to make our trip blindly and hope for it to get settled over in Tashkent. Our flight departing Singapore was delayed by an hour plus and transit in KL it was again delayed another hour. It happened the same for our flights home whereby new transit was in Jakarta it got delayed an hour an half. We barely made it to catch our flight home with MH that the airline booked us home on. My luggage was left behind because of this. Flight crew were not friendly barely smiled no matter how polite we tried to be. And they never once served water after the meal service. We had to keep going to ask for it and they always gave an unhappy look. Seriously I dont know what kind of service industry this airline is in because there wasnt any at all. The food from Singapore was okay but the food from Tashkent was awful. Tasteless and dry. Our flight home was a night flight yet the lights were not switched off for sleeping. It was a really suffering 18 hours journey home with no food and no sleep and with unconfortable seats. Such a pity because the country is so beautiful and the Uzbeks are really nice people. The airline crew need to undergo intensive service training for sure.
Chaotic incompetent organisation from start to finish. Ticketing purchase only a single email confirmation unable to check in online. Upon our return Rome to Ams one of us had been deleted from the reservation completely without any explanation. Took over 20 minutes to resolve at the check out desk. No explanation was given Boarding RomeAms passengers were asked to board but had to wait almost 40 minutes in the corridor leading to the airplane with no explanation given. Passengers included pregnant women small children and elderly. There were no refreshments or anywhere to sit. The quality of the airplane and seats was fine but I would not recommend this airline to anyone
Paris CDG to New York. Probably from a service standpoint one of the best flights I have ever experienced. Online checkin was a bit of a problem so I contacted AF via Facebook explaining the problem. They acknowledged my message almost immediately four hours later texted me that the issue was resolved and they had proactively checked me in. Boarding in Paris I was met with sincere smiles from all the cabin crew. Interactions were lighthearted and good humored and cabin service was at all times professional and upbeat with an obvious desire to satisfy passengers. Crew never seemed rushed and routinely chatted with passengers. I am fortunate to be Elite Plus with SkyTeam and was seated at the end of the cabin. As meal carts were rolled out one flight attendant came to me and asked my dinner choice to ensure I got it. This simple and thoughtful gesture was significant because it showed attention to detail and a desire to serve. I dont like the 2x2x2 seating video library is awkward and food is unappealing but the empathetic service made for a wonderful flight.
This must be the prime business route for Qantas and very important for them given all the options now available with other airlines. The service was poor well meaning staff but chaotically managed the food on this and other stages was nondescript and unattractively served. Long delays between courses and collecting up. No help offered with preparing bedding etc.. The whole experience emphasised how by comparison BA has managed to spruce up and recover its business service standards and is for the moment an incomparably better way of getting to and from Australia.
I booked Bengaluru to Kochi original Time was 5.10 and the flight got rescheduled for three times and its got rescheduled to 7.05 in the night. I never experienced such a worst experience in my entire life and customer care saying if your flight got rescheduled more then 2 hrs then only will be an option to change the flight. They sayi1.55 min is not sufficient for them to say 2 hrs. Dont book through Go First unless you have plenty of time to waste...
Hanoi to Danang. Finally an airline that has bought back the service in Vietnam. Impressed and hope they keep it up. Check in seamless lounge infinitely better than others in Noi Bai. Flight left as scheduled could not ask for more. Definite value for money.
Dakar to Prague via Istanbul. They changed our flight and we had to wait 10 hours at the airport. Via email they promised Istanbul tour but at the airport we have been told that tour started 830 and next is too late to be back on time at the airport we still have almost 9 hours to wait. Nobody helped us they was sending us from hotel desk to information and from information to denied flight and nobody was able to tell as what to do. Service unbelievably horrible I have tried to ask for compensation but all what they sent have been just s few formal and unsympathetic messages that theyre just unable to offer any kind of compensation. This is was our very last flight with Turkish Airlines.
An unreliable company with careless customer service. My flight was permanently further delayed with nonsense announcements culminating when Air France App claimed at 6h07 pm the flight was scheduled to leave at 5h15pm see picture We finally left with 2h delay for a 1h flight. No WiFi on board contrary to what was advertised before the flight and even on board. The cabin crew was unapologetic. No way to work or inform business partners at MPL of my scheduled arrival time. Inflight business meal consisted of nuts one cookie and a drink. I dont see the difference with economy. Finally arrived starved late having lost my business day. Despite Platinum loyalty status and flying business class all this was considered not worth any compensation by AF customer service. I regret not having traveled by train.
Tokyo to Zagreb via Dubai. I will never again fly with this airline because of the luggage allowance and inflight service. Normally airlines allow one piece of checked in luggage and one carry on when you fly intercontinental and then they charge you per extra piece of luggage. But no Emirates allow only 30 kg checked in and 8 kg 1 piece only carry on everything extra is charged 100 USD per kg. Since I also had my backpack I would only carry on that and had to check in my two suitcases and one carry on. The flight attendants kept talking out loud in the back of the plane I was seated in the back so could hear them the entire time. Apart from serving meals they rarely passed through the plane to see if passengers needed anything.
Dubai to Los Angeles. The service was very poor the crew inattentive and unfriendly. The food ran out the cabin was not cleaned the wait time at check in was very long and only two staff were deployed.
Wish I had read these reviews. I paid over 2500 for tickets from London to Dubai to Bangladesh for early next year. Im travelling with my wife and 2 babies 1 2.5 years old. The only reason I chose their flights was because it gave the best option of 14 hours in total for flight and transit which is still long with 2 babies but better than 21.5 hours they suddenly decided to change my original flights booked only 10 days before theyve sent me a text and a short email to say this is your new itinerary nothing else. I was shocked. How could any airline be so insensitive knowing that these customers are flying with an infant and a 2.5 year old so the least they could do instead of sending us a little text and email giving us no option whatsoever to change or contact them to discuss or be decent to call us at least to see if this was acceptable or not did we want to change our flights or else cancel and get a refund as they have breached our contract. But nothing and when we tried to call their number in London this guy said he cant help us with rebooking or a refund but he can put us through to them in Dubai. I hang on and on for 3 hours before realising this was a trick to just get rid of us. I got tired and hung up. There is no other way for us to contact them now at all because when we call their only one number in London you get the due to high volume of calls we cant answer your call when I tried the only number given in Dubai nobody answers. Not only are we devastated but also out of pocket by 2500 because we cant possibly go on their imposed alternative flight of 21.5 hours with 2 small restless babies.
If United Airlines was the last airline on earth I would never fly again These guys are terrible Coming and going delay delay delay...except for the very last leg of our trip. But since the previous flight was delayed the door to our plane was closed when we got to the gate and they wouldnt let us on. We ran all across the airport to board the plane and that was the one that departed on time They couldnt delay that one two minutes to make up for their error Needless to say the boarding agent couldnt care less about what their mistakes cost me in time another 5 12 hour delay and frustration. Will never...ever fly with them again
Bangkok to Hong Kong. On this fight Cathay Pacific let me know it is a 5star airline even though I am in economy class. Boarding was fast thanks to the ground service in Thailand. The seat is very comfortable and cabin crew are very nice and some of them are from Thailand showing they care about the local passengers. Also the food is delicious and they served nice red wine in economy class.
Kiev to Istanbul. The service is surely not bad but is not as high and as expected. A321 with very narrow uncomfortable seats and not pleasant to fly. InFlight Entairtainment didnt want to work. At Istambul Airport all our boarding and de boarding were serviced by bus and it takes a lot of time. The crew was not very attentive but was professional however.
FRALCY. Took off nearly an hour late in Frankfurt due to weather flight uneventful until about 10 mins before landing had to do a missed approach due to bad fog. Had to divert to BHX and waited an hour for a coach to LCY arriving at 12.30am when we should have arrived at 6.40pm. Very frustrating although not BA Cityflyers fault. Its put me off using LCY as an airport due to its small size and how the weather affects it.
Yangon to Tokyo. There was a storm in the South China Sea. Youd think that when the flight is cancelled theyd at least shoot an email to the customers. They did nothing. We went to the airport and was informed that the flight is cancelled. To be fair they did pay decent compensations for hotel and transportation.
Denpasar to Heathrow via Dubai. Our baggage arrived at Heathrow terminal soaking wet as well as damaged Massively disappointed and will not be flying with Emirates again considering the amount me and my girlfriend paid for our business class flights. Ive never had baggage arrive soaking wet and a new surfboard damaged even with a new bag packaged with 15mm of padding top and bottom. I find this almost insulting that Emirates can treat passengers in such low disregard.
Tallin to Singapore via Istanbul. It was my first time flying with Turkish on long haul flight and I was expecting a good experience. The food was bad on all the flights we had. The A330300 from Istanbul to Singapore seemed old. The touch screens were not working normally only with the remote that made navigation uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment was really good though. It would have been nice if cabin crew would have offered drinks and snacks during the flight in addition to the dinner and breakfast served. On the way back from Singapore to Istanbul we were seated in the isle and it was just so cold I was sitting with a hat scarf sweater cardigan blanket on me and my wool coat way over my head and I still got sore throat.
Bangkok to Almaty on Boeing 757. Quick and efficient check in and given priority pass and lounge invitation. Boarding was quick. Seats were angled flat but reasonably comfortable. Cabin crew were effective and had good English. Meals were quite tasty but not quite to the standard that I have come to expect from Air Astana. Flight was uneventful and landed a few minutes early. Luggage come quite quickly off the plane. Almaty to Moscow A320 Early morning departure and the traditional sit up business seat with reasonable leg room and comfort. Food was a little disappointing compared to previous flights. Portable entertainment with reasonable selection of films although I mostly slept. Cabin crew were good and again had very good English skills. Plane left and landed on time and luggage came very quickly off the flight.
Helsinki to Kiev via Istanbul. Flying Turkish Airlines for the very first time. I was simply shocked in a good way. I have never seen a more spacious plane with such leg room in economy class. The served meal was just lovely cabin crew as well. 1010.
Very slow and poor customer service from Singapore airlines. I flew from Johannesburg to Bangkok on 20052023. Upon arrival I noticed my luggage was damaged the bottom of my bag was broken and the wheel broke off. I contacted Singapore airlines for assistance. they replied with several different emails requesting documentation and pictures which I sent. I am flying back to Johannesburg tomorrow 29052023 without a bag I can use. Ive indicated the urgency to Singapore airlines but theres no regard for this.
Glasgow to Tampa via Gatwick. Early morning flight Glasgow to Gatwick. Flight dud take off at 6.45. Boarded with doors closed by 6.30 bug did not depart till 7.10 due to Gatwick being busy smooth flight down. Gatwick to Tampa according to manage my booking aircraft changed 2 days prior to departure. At boarding was told our World Traveller plus seats had been upgraded to Club World a very pleasant surprise. If was on 777 which had not been refurbished extra space was very good staff were very efficient and pleasant. Only downside was the main meal which I would have had in original seats but main courses were not to my liking but afternoon tea was very good. So thank you BA for the experience.
Singapore to Seoul return. Excellent service onboard. Refreshing hot towels were provided before each flight. Food may not be the best but still pretty good. Plenty of movies to choose from with the inflight entertainment although the system looks rather old on the A330s.
We chose Emirates to fly Manila to Boston and then back to Manila from JFK International. Our flight to Boston was pretty good except that my seat and my cousins seat cannot be reclined so we werent able to sleep well it was very uncomfortable. I think they should do something about it knowing that long haul flights are very tiring. Now our flight back from JFK intl airport to Manila is very much a hassle . We were only told that the flight was delayed for 5 hours exactly during check in time instead of 1120am it became 430 in the afternoon which obviously made us upset plus the fact that nobody is explaining why it was delayed. Its a good thing though that they already allowed us to check in our luggage. However we needed to line up at the Checkin counter for an hour and 30 minutes. It was also disappointing that when waiting on the line almost all the counters prioritized the Business class passengers. The flight however had a late boarding it was supposed to board at 330 but they started boarding at 430. Our copassengers have become impatient. We all crowded the boarding gate. Why No one announced whats happening. I asked the ground personnel what time are they boarding but her answer is just in a few minutes. What the heck you let us wait for 5 hours and more and you cannot tell us specific answers. And now we have to wait for 12 hours for our flight to Manila. Were supposed to be back to work by tomorrow. Please give fair treatment to all your passengers. The reason for delays must be explained.
Dubai to New York. I misspelled a letter while booking my ticket found out in the email I received called to correct a letter they charged me 30. Bad practice regulation Emirates Airline. Will avoid in further booking.
Holiday flight from Moscow DME to Lisbon. Paid EUR 750 for a return ticket which is far too much for what you get. Transaero has a separate checkin zone in Domodedovo and flights to Europe have dedicated check in counters though there is no indication of it whatsoever. I saw people flying to Astana queuing in front of me were refused checkin and had to queue again at another counter. Boarding started on time then there was a very long bus ride to the remote part of the airport. After boarding a 1hr delay was announced as the purser explained due to bad weather in DME. From my window I could see planes taking off and landing. Onboard the legroom was very good much larger than usual in Economy. Staff reasonably friendly food served was not tasty but filling. The selection was beef or chicken. There was no inflight entertainment. The return flight was on time with exactly the same features onboard.
After having recently also travelled on Emirates I thought it might be interesting to compare business class on Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines travel was Brisbane to Munich and Frankfurt to Brisbane both of course via Singapore. Both trips were busy business trips where everything needed to be on time and hasslefree. Singapore Airlines exuded high quality personal service. Aircraft were spotless and cabins quiet including on one sector SingaporeBrisbane when a number of babies turned up. Disappointing was the food and wine including the choices available. Emirates was far better in this category. Also Singapore Airlines had no hot towels or printed menus. Maybe this was due to recent COVID issues but the comparison with Emirates was stark. Also Lounge access and quality was very poor. The Silver Kris Lounge in Singapore at midnight resembled a packed works canteen on a bad day. Boarding was quite chaotic at a number of places especially at Frankfurt which often seems to be the case for these Singapore Airlines A380 flights out of Frankfurt. Nevertheless the quality of the cabin staff on all sectors was absolutely superb. Lets hope the quality of food and wine improves to how it once was.
San Diego to Heathrow. Checkin security and boarding were all with minimum delay. Cabin crew efficient and friendly. Food quality wasnt great nothing like food served a few years ago and their amenity bag really isnt worth having. Having said that we had a pleasant flight as crew made up for disappointing food. We even managed several hours sleep which is always a bonus.
Phnom Penh to Manchester via Doha. Have flown Qatar Airways several times over the last few years and it has been generally good with friendly helpful staff. But I have had problems with the inflight entertainment system which is difficult to operate and often has faults though not broken. The food is average at best. Meals are very small and the light meal snack is always the same a hot baked thing sweet or savoury option which they call a sandwich but is something different with a small poor cake. The chicken sandwiches are quite unpleasant and difficult to eat but when youre hungry and there is no alternative offered what can you do
Our family took flight cz305 from Guangzhou to Auckland of New Zealand on the evening of April 30. Due to my personal negligence I forgot to apply for an international travel health code. However the ground staff who checked in our luggage that day patiently helped us for nearly two hours and finally successfully boarded the plane. Here I would like to thank the ground staff who helped us. Thank them so much
Ho Chi Minh to Danang. We have already been delayed twice now leaving 9 hours later than expected. We are bracing ourselves for 12 more delays. It is likely they keeping delaying people to a flight that will be full enough in order to save them money. Thanks for a complete absence of customer service Jetstar. I will do my best to deter anyone else from using your sorry excuse of an airline.
Amsterdam to Paris. A short flight but with full service. Both ground staff as well as on onboard staff was very friendly and classy. Snacks and drinks were handled with care. Seats are very comfortable for economy class but pitch is very tight. Unfortunately the USB charging ports didnt work. We arrived in Paris without delays and the captain kept us well informed.
My flights actual departure was 1 hour late but the airline said nothing about the delay. Passengers were confused and tired waiting at the gate. On our ticket the departure gate was D3. But without any announcement the gate was changed to D7. I almost boarded the wrong flight the flight from D3 was JT22 but my flight was JT42. Both heading to Denpasar but JT22 delayed for 3 hours.. After boarding there were 2 passengers yelling and arguing because their seat was the same. Poor communications is not only a Lion Air problem. Poor ground management poor baggage handling and many more problems await you if you book your flight with Lion Air.
I tried it on my trip abroad upon the recommendation of my friends. They really provide as good service as they say. I didnt expect this much. I bought it for my return trip as well lets see if I can get the same service again.
I was coming from USA and having connecting flight to Lucknow. At the time of baggage checking the staff Shakshi helped me a lot as there was one bag extra and I have already paid for that but somehow its was not showing in their website. This girl really help a lot to get it clear.
My wife and I arrived at the airport 90 minutes in advance and the flight was delayed 30 minutes so we ended up 2 hours early. The lines for baggage dropoff were out the door. We used a JetBlue kiosk to purchase two bag tags to check two of our bags it charged us for two but only printed out one. We were told by a JetBlue employee to go to the kiosk help desk line to address the issue there were two snaking lines of maybe 2030 people each manned by just two employees and they were moving at the rate of one customer every 1015 minutes. Were we to wait in that line we almost certainly were going to miss our flight. So we elected to use a second kiosk to purchase a bag tag for our second bag in the hopes this one would work it didnt but it took our money again. So rather than jump from kiosk to kiosk paying more and more money in the hope that one would work which is unreasonable we were forced to wait in line. By the time we reached the front the JetBlue employee told us that we were going to miss our flight and that in addition the flight was overbooked so they were going to have to rebook or cancel. She searched for other flights that day including through JetBlue its partner American Airlines and nonpartner airlines the earliest available flight was July 1. It was the morning of June 28 we had just moved out of our apartment and shipped our stuff to LA and we were scheduled to move into our new LA apartment that same day so we would have had to pay for food and lodging for the interval period in Bostona hefty pricerather than stay in our new paidfor apartment in LA. We explained this to the JetBlue employee who said that she would cancel our flight and issue a refund for our tickets and bags. I requested confirmation that this would be to our original payment method she confirmed it would be. There was only one more flight in the entire Boston region that had capacity to take us to LA before July 1 a flight leaving in two hours out of Providence. My wife and I booked the flight quickly compared taxi and rideshare prices discovered the difference was negligible and took an Uber to the airport in Providence where we successfully boarded the last flight to LA. We later discovered that we had been deceived by the JetBlue employee at the kiosk help desk in Boston she did NOT issue any refund and instead wrote in her notes that my wife and I were late to check in our bags which was a complete lie and clearly intended to create a fabricated falsified paper trail to later deny us a refund. We could not check in our bags because JETBLUES kiosks were defective but that didnt matter to JetBlues customer service representatives. The fact that we were told the flight was overbooked even though it apparently wasnt didnt matter to JetBlues customer service representatives. We had to fight for hours over the phone to even get our bags refunded were still on the hook for the tickets according to JetBlues policy.
British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new MS food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA
London to Seattle. My husband and I have used this service for a number of years as our son lives in America. We have always been very satisfied with the service. Unfortunately I was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb Id like to thank the cabin crew and Captain for the care I received during the last two hours of the flight. Advice was sought via radio I was made comfortable in the galley at least one crew member with me at all times given oxygen etc. paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when I was then given a thorough medical check a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as I was not well enough to walk to the car park. We met the crew at the lift and the captain came to ask how I was. Many thanks to all of the and apologies to passengers that I must have disturbed.
We travelled on the QR260 flight from Warsaw to Doha on the 1st August 2021 en route to Maldives and had the most wonderful experience. Despite travelling in economy class weve been given a truly firstclass treatment by a flight attendant named Petra. Shes been attentive professional and truly went above and beyond our expectations. Despite the Qatar Airways app not registering our meal preferences weve been sorted by Petra in no time at all and with a big smile. Outstanding
Flew Emirates from Karachi to Jeddah via Dubai. Best airline in the world and the Gulf. Emirates offer the best cuisines onboard and have the most comfortable economy class seats. Inflight entertainment system cant be described in words it was excellent and it had all movies of our native country. The crew were also very friendly.
Luton to New York Newark with La Compagnie taking advantage of their offer of return trip for 2 for 1700. Having read some previous adverse comments about this airline we were somewhat apprehensive about what to expect. I have to say however that our fears were unfounded. The whole experience apart from the state of Luton Airport which is not La Compagnies fault was very pleasant. The aircraft which was immaculate was not full on either leg and the stewardesses in their very smart uniforms were friendly and most helpful. Indeed service was excellent throughout and food and wine were very good albeit the coffee was tepid. Inflight entertainment is somewhat limited but was sufficient for a 7hour flight. We found the reclining seats comfortable with plenty of position options. Check in at Luton and customs and security screening was very efficient using the fast track lane and the newly refurbished Aspire Lounge is very comfortable. Overall La Compagnie offers excellent value for money and gives passengers who might otherwise travel in cramped economy class greater comfort and a more personal level of service for a little more than the cost of an economy class ticket. It is early days for the company and hopefully the occupancy rate on their flights will pick up and thus make it a viable financial venture. They certainly deserve to succeed.
Jakarta to Jayapura. Comfortable flight with decent food and a good selection of movies. The only minor problem was that headsets were not provided and had to be purchased from crew for 25.000 Rp. With the fare very similar to nofrills Lion Air part of the same group Batik is very good value.
I had 2 major surgeries in Puerto Vallarta and was in a lot of pain. We just needed to get home. The stewardesses went above and beyond to help us one let me get a personal water bottle and both of them kept checking on my husband and I. I was last to deboard and they both helped us. I cant say enough on how grateful we were that they took the time to care with do much sincerity.
On my flight from Marrakech to Gatwick via Casablanca the flight was consistently delayed and we were given no information the attendants at the gate either ran away from passengers who were asking what was happening were rude to them or ignored us. They assured us we would not miss our connecting flight to London as soon as we arrived in Casablanca we were met with zero help and told all flights to London had left for the day. Again desk agents were incredibly rude ignoring people begging for help. I am 300 pounds out of pocket paying for their mistakes. They refuse to get in touch with me via email or any other means. They ignore their customers. Never fly them Not a single apology was offered to me.
Flew from LHRMauritiusPerth return with my husband myself and 22 month old son. We werent looking forward to the flights especially as our son didnt have a seat so was sitting on our laps but all 4 flights were fantastic. We were very lucky that on the 3 of the flights the plane was empty and both ground staff and cabin crew made sure we had a row of four seats so loads of room for a little one to stretch out. I thought the seats were comfortable enough far more leg more than on our flight with Qantas whilst in Australia. The cabin crew were very friendly polite and helpful. They werent snotty about us walking our son up and down the aisle which we have experienced with other airlines Qantas being one of them. The bar seemed to be open for the entire flight which unfortunately we couldnt take advantage of being responsible parents and the food was nice. I would recommend Air Mauritius their customer service was excellent which helped travelling with a child a very unstressful and relaxing experience.
Port Moresby to Singapore with Air Niugini and they provided the best assistance and service I have experienced. The ground staff and the checkin service was wonderful and very quick. The staff is professional and helpful. The 6 hours flight from POM to SIN journey was very comfortable and relaxing. The crew were very decent and helping. Overall wonderful and memorable experience.
Bombay to Tokyo Narita in Business Class on a Boeing 7878. Boarding in Bombay was very orderly. The Business Class pods on ANA are very well conceived affording privacy comfort and plenty of table space. Inflight service is excellent with flight attendants displaying warmth and efficiency. One point of criticism we didnt see any food until 90 mins out of Bombay and the hot course arrived only after 2 hours. Given that the flight departs BOM at dinnertime this is unacceptable. ANA should roll out the dinner service soon after attaining cruise altitude. There as no wifi on this flight another sore point with me. But the overall experience is first rate.
Thai Airways cancel my flight that cost I and my wife 3 days in Hamburg to wait another flight back to our Sydney. They wrote a letter and said we regret for inconvenience. then nothing more to show they care for their customers. Now I am complaining them and I just received that we have no basis to consider for any sort of compensation. What can you do with such a bad and rude company like Thai Airways I take no more Thai Airways and ask you to do the same.
Gatwick to Mauritius. Very disappointing airline and service. The facing each other seats are fun theoretically but when reality hits its a mess. Why Because you get other people stumbling on your feet during midflight. Or is it just my luck and most the other passengers on business class were old and not flexible enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you midsleep every time they need to use the restroom The TV monitors colors are so off. it was a nightmare trying to enjoy any movie. Getting the brightness right to make the colors work. Because if you dont want the monitor to blind you when its snooze time good luck watching the movie in any other color than black and red. The worst thing was the food salad was frozen. The beef filet was so dry and flavorless but too salty. My partners chicken was swimming in a pool of oil and flavorwise it was hitting all the wrong spots. They believe in Umami and dump a ton of MSGs on their food to make it taste edible but did they get that wrong. I ended up eating bread and butter only. Same goes for the scrambled eggs for breakfast. Bacon was extra salty. And the fresh fruit bowl was just as frozen as the salad. Overall very poor and disappointing experience.
I would not hesitate to fly with Air Niugini Airlines again. I flew twice with them last year 2003 to Singapore and happened to have on board two of the same crew as my previous flight with them. They couldnt do enough for their passengers Qantas could take take a leaf out of their book. I no longer fly with Qantas as I find the staff always trying to avoid going that extra mile especially when it comes to night flights.
Recent trip to Boston departing LHR T5. Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 333 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and proactively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew proactively removing trays from people who had finished early something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DOCO was exceptional I dont think ive eaten so much on a transAtlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an outstation. Overall it was a great flight helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere. I would definitely consider flying with them again.
London Heathrow to Las Vegas. Never had need to write a bad airline review before now. British Airways was the worst airline I have ever flown with. Old shabby and dirty plane. Tv screen was broken and hanging off the back of seat when I arrived. The only nice crew member for the whole flight managed to move me. The seat I then sat in was dirty and had dirt on the seat back old food stains and on the belt. No drink served with meal except water. When I eventually went up looking for a drink they had no beer at all and only had a little wine left. I had a white wine. When I asked for a second yes only a second drink on a 9 hour flight I was told they had run out of wine also. I had to have orange juice. Awful and rude staff with exception of one. Worst airline by far I have ever flown with.
Even on a smaller aircraft like this A330 seats were decently spaced out in economy and cabin crew service puts some airlines to shame. Hainan chicken rice one of the best tasting ones Ive had Magnum ice cream. Even though IFE on their newer aircraft like the A350s are better the older aircraft such as this A330 wasnt bad. Cabin crew helped to hang our jacketsgarment bags hot towels snacks drinks on top of the meals metal crockery. Ive had the chance to fly economy on their A380 B777300ER B777200ER. The B772 is an older plane and its IFE could use an upgrade and the new retrofitted A380 tends to have slightly smaller legroom than the rest. The 773s and A350s are super comfortable. SQ is still a world class airline.
Check in process at Cologne very poor. Flight displayed as delayed 35 minutes. 45 minutes past scheduled time announced flight cancelled with no explanation. Luggage had to be retrieved only two agents available to process 150 passengers. Gave up after two hours stood in line and found own hotel. Still unable to get a reason for the cancellation. I suspect there will no be months of aggravation reclaiming our costs. Arrived home 16 hours late via another airline without any GermanwingsEurowings assistance.
Air Tahiti Nui is absolutely horrible My husband and I bought tickets from Air Tahiti Nui to go to Tahiti for our honeymoon. We had a connecting flight with another airline. My husband and I paid an additional 60 through Air Tahiti Nui so we could sit together on a 8 hour international flight. Due to a flight time change our ticket numbers changed. Air Tahiti Nuis system did not sync with the other airlines system. Therefore Air Tahiti Nui lost our reservation and sold our seats that we paid for Then Air Tahiti Nui blamed us for changing our ticket numbers. Im not sure how that is even possible to do on our end After going back and fourth with Air Tahiti Nui for 2 hours at the airport they found 2 spots for us on the flight. However the seats were not together despite the fact we paid an additional 60 to sit together. Absolutely ridiculous No wonder their reviews are so low.
Flew LUXLCY. A very pleasant flight even if it was short. The Fokker 50 aircraft was lovely and although old and a bit falling apart was comfortable enough with plenty of legroom. Cabin crew were delightful and distributed a choice of croissant or pain au chocolate and water or orange juice half way through the flight which was nice. Captain gave announcements throughout the flight on the slightly old and crackly PA system. The inflight magazine was dull. Check in was very easy however we were charged 60 euros for 2 check in bags as we had not payed for them in advance. This is disappointing for a full service airline charging for luggage. Overall a great flight.
Service on point as always Better seats in a Boeing 787. More comfortable for me. Well the privacy door is snice but seat comfy. Still dont understand why free wifi isnt included in business tickets.
Kiev to Bamako via Istanbul. The most horrible experience among all the airlines I have ever used. Three days have already passed since airplane landed in Bamako and my luggage still was not delivered. Apparently air operator abuses the scarce number of flights available in the indicated direction and substitute passengers luggage by commercial cargo. This company demonstrates highest degree of disrespect towards its customers and I see no point to positively assess it.
I purchased a round trip ticket on Alaska Airlines for a flight operated by Virgin America. Three hours before my Sunday evening return flight from Portland was to depart for San Francisco 315 p.m. and my flight was scheduled for 620 p.m. I received three text messages from Alaska Airlines letting me know the flight is canceled and I have been rebooked on a 5 a.m. flight from Portland to San Francisco via Los Angeles arriving in San Francisco at 1140 a.m. the next day a Monday. There was no explanation given for the flight cancellation. The text message included a tollfree number that did not work when I called it. It said I had a message waiting for me but when I pressed 1 for my message it said I had no messages. It was a fully automated line and pressing 0 did not connect me to an operator it only repeated the cycle that said I had a message and then said I did not have a message waiting for me. I had to buy a 199 oneway ticket on Southwest that got me back to San Francisco at 1230 a.m. Sunday. I had a meeting Monday morning at work that I could not miss and Alaska provided no options for rebooking on other flights that would get me back on Sunday night. This is very poor customer service and I cannot recommend Alaska or Virgin to anyone.
Unfortunately again experiencing this airline and its airconditioning not working. We all are sitting and waiting for more than 40 minutes in plane without airconditioning right away. Again bad experience.
Hong Kong to Bangkok. The inordinate delay of CX701 on 20 January 3 hours for a flight that is shorter than that was not mitigated by the falling standards of Cathay both in aircraft food on board etc. Neither was it helped by an overcrowded CX lounge at the Wing which had to cope with several other delayed flights to Jakarta Tokyo LA etc. On top of that announcements about all these delays was almost inaudible in the lounge with poor annunciation and low volume so that most of the time they were pointless. The levels of food and refreshments in the lounge were quite frankly dire. On board the service was its expected politeness and efficiency but the quality of the food was really below standard such that I have never previously experienced.
Gatwick to Islamabad via Dubai. Overall it was ok experience but I was expecting more from Emirates. I booked this flight six months ago and was travelling with infant so I had already selected bulkhead seats at the front of both legs of my journey. However Emirates decided to change my seats two weeks before from 8A to 38D on DXBISB route making me furious. Upon calling them I was given the usual answer that the aircraft was changed which was a blatant lie as it was the same aircraft. Emirates need to honour the commitments they make as it was a nightmare with an infant moving right back in the aircraft so all the hypes of portraying itself as a family friendly airline was proved wrong. On the other hand IFE was great but food lacked taste and variety.
This airline is really making us proud. I had the opportunity to fly with Fiji Airways in August to Kiribati and back and then this month to LAX and back and I could not be prouder of how this airline is coming out of the pandemic. I had wonderful sets of crew who had great personalities interacted with passengers and remembered frequent flyers. Unlike crew in the US who hide in the galley to gossip among themselves after service the Fiji crew are on their feet preparing carts for the next service interacting with passengers in the galley and making rounds with water. They had a mini snack bar set up in each section of the cabin offered hot towels before breakfast and their meal quality is top notch. I mean who can complain about pancakes for breakfast The airline is punching above its weight and it deserves to be recognised for it.
Blue Islands provide Ryanair quality for British Airways prices. They didnt load our checked bag onto the plane because theyd sold too many seats. Absolutely no information until we arrived in Jersey to our surprise. Very poor service getting our bags back if we did not chase we would not have heard anything. I would never voluntarily fly with them again.
My wife and I flew with Monarch Airlines from Gatwick to Las Palmas. Due to being a wheelchair user I managed to book extra legroom seats. The whole process from check in to leaving the aircraft went smoothly. What I really liked was that the staff listened to what I needed and went with it. The cabin crew were absolutely fantastic and could not have been more helpful. Everything was done with kindness and a genuine smile. I have taken many flights to various destinations around the world using different airlines and this team were amongst the very best. The seats were not too bad for width and legroom considering I am 63 tall and over 280kg. I used my own wheelchair gel cushion and back support so this may have made a positive difference. The aircraft was half empty so we ended up having a seat between us for our bits and bobs. It made for a very relaxed experience. We left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. I cannot say enough positive words about this flight and the cabin crew.
Flight from Sao Paulo to Paris. Departure was on time. Business class cabin service is good as expected. Cabin configuration is 232. Business class starts at row 3. It was still the old cabin but the seat reclines 180 degrees. Good service 3 different meals options snacks available during all flight. Arrived on time at CDG. Would fly again Business Class but only with a ticket issued with miles.
Our Germania direct flight from Beirut to Munich was cancelled and changed to Dusseldorf Airport without informing us The staff of Germania promised that an airplane will take us from Dusseldorf to Munich. However no airplane but a bus ride of 8 hours.
SPUDTM.30th May 2013. 08.20 Departure. Flight arrived in from Cologne on time. Upon boarding the return leg to Dortmund the senior male cabin crew member stood at the forward door and did not acknowledge any of his passengers when we boarded. Not a Good Morning or Hello or even the slightest hint of a smile. After Take Off the racket of banging galley doors continued throughout the flight The senior male cabin crew member commenced service from the front of the cabin by himself I was clearly travelling on my own astonishingly his inflight service statement was und Sie and you Not what would I like to drink or would I like a Cheese or Ham sandwich Not even a smile and showing No enthusiasm Upon leaving the aircraft I didnt expect a Goodbye and of course didnt receive One. Poor customer service.
Paris to San Francisco. The checkin at CDG was horrible with very long queue. The A380 inside looked old and the door of one of the toilet did not close and a bad smell came. We said that to the cabin crew but instead of closing the toilet they just sprayed some deodorant Food was of very low quality. Very expensive airline for low quality service.
The airline cancelled flight few hours before boarding time and than gave option after 2 days which impacted all my tourism plans. Then gave very basic support on hotel accommodation. After that refund process also very complicated for a simple thing like spend that customer had to do for 2 days before waiting for flight
Months ago I bought these tickets a single reservation paid with a single credit card. To our surprise at the time of precheck in the day before the flight my husband appears assigned to row 30 of the plane while I appeared in row 18 I think. We decided to arrive at the Boston airport early to try to get seats together and there they tell us that we should try to do it at the boarding desk we were waiting there until a Delta employee showed up there and with a very bad attitude told us that we had to wait until 3 PM without guarantee to talk about this and he got to talk on the phone for an hour and a half. After 3 PM he simply left and left me and 4 other people waiting in line because their boarding passes did NOT have assigned seats. We waited and waited and when we saw that the screen said that the boarding process would start in 20 minutes and there was no one there I went to the desk of the next flight to tell the lady from Delta that there was no one to attend us and the screen It said that the boarding began in 20 minutes. She called on the phone and finally another employee came running and told me that if my husband and I were on the same reservation she would try to seat us together and she kept both boarging passes. The passengers began to board and I had to remind him that I did not know which group I belonged to because I had 2 assigned seats in very distant rows and it was there that he verbally told me that we would be together in Main Cabin 1. When they called that group we still did not know what were our seats but in the middle of the row the employee finally printed the tickets that I show in this review. In the middle of the flight when I went to the bathroom I saw that all the people who were in line with me waiting to see which seat they were going to be assigned were sitting in the last rows. The truth is that I do not understand why Delta mistreats its customers like this. I think that everyone even those of us who pay for cheap tickets deserve a minimum of respect and consideration.
Madrid to Sydney via Dubai. This is a review that is a follow up on my outbound. The reviews are almost identical. Great hard product but the soft product on Emirates is just simply lacking and its down to the crews who are at best very lackadaisical. You have a few who are superb but on the whole it reflects a training problem. Much noise and chat going on which is very annoying during the night routes. One thing I have never seen and clearly much revelry goes on in the Emirates dorms. One female FA groped the boob of another in a playful manner. Now for red hot blooded males this may be fine but sorry this is a major flag carrier. Whilst on the Emirates gripe. The IFE is fine but to be honest was struggling too find some films that really appealed. Emirates caters for a huge language base. Final gripe. The seat quality certainly in economy is dire. The cushioning is hard or maybe has been so well used that it is worn. Come on Emirates. A one time leader has slipped into the pack with a terrible soft product.
I was amazed at their decision of a no reply email sent to me after 9 months of trying for a refund to my personal account in which you had already promised me and have registered. I was promised a refund of money to my bank 9 months ago after many hour and emails talking to the computer generated eva covid 19 shut Australia. I have still not received when i enquired they stated my case was closed.
Johannesburg to Abuja via Kigali. I was supposed to fly as per my boarding passes attached we were notified that there is a flight delay and we wont make our connection a promise was made that our bags will be offloaded and brought back to us. We waited and nothing happened our business trip is compromised as all my presentation notes and suits are in the luggage not to mention that the host had to make other arrangements as we were a day late. I am very dissaponted at how Rwandair treats its customers weve made several communications to no avail. I will never ever fly Rwandair nor recommend it to anyone ever.
Had 2 great flights from Kuwait to Dubai and back with Emirates. The last time I flown Emirates was back in 2015 I then switched to Qatar Airways which I found is better. My recent flight with Emirates was great overall. But yes their services went down seat selection no longer free 25kg only for Economy Class no more hot towels served prior to departure in Economy Class. Other negatives are WiFi was available but not working on both flights. IFE Box under the seats blocking some legroom. Very tiring boarding organization unlike Qatar Airways Emirates closes the gate 45 minutes prior to departure time while Qatar Airways closes the gate 20 minutes prior to departure time. Emiratess 45 minutes causes a long long queue. Postives good and comfortable seats the 10abreast B777300ER is decent not as bad as people say. Of course I wont deny the AwardWinning Excellent ICE Entertainment System. Despite both flights were operated on old planes with very unresponsive touch screens the movies selection were uptodate. Very friendly cabin crew excellent meal service for a 1 hour 30 minutes flight. Clean cabin beautiful and luxury OrangeColoredmoodlighting system. I would fly them again as a second choice after Qatar Airways it was a pleasure Emirates.
I purchased a one way flight with Jetstar Pacific at a total cost of A519 to fly from Da Nang to Sydney on 19122019 for Xmas. The first leg involved a domestic flight to HCMC where I was to connect to the international flight to Sydney. My flight was due to depart Ho Chi Minh City at 10.35pm. At 7.15pm I was advised that the flight had been delayed until 4.45am the next day. After much trouble I managed to change my flight to the same flight departing at 10.35pm on 20122019. I had to outlay for taxis and a hotel. On 20122019 I checked in and was waiting to board when we were advised that the flight had been cancelled. We were subsequently advised by an Information officer no Jetstar rep met with us at the boarding gate that all Jetstar flights had be cancelled and that we were to find and fund our own way to Sydney. We then paid for taxis to a hotel paid for by Jetstar. I booked a flight with AirAsia to Sydney for the 21 December at a total cost of 679. Today 21 January I contacted Jetstar seeking a full refund and was advised that they would only refund 197 because were really unable to process a full refund for your flight since you took the first flight log transcript. This is how Jetstar Pacific treat their customers absolute disgrace
I had the misfortune to travel up to Newcastle on a handbaggage only fare which for some reason doesnt entitle you to choose a seat. I was allocated seat 11A which had the tightest legroom I have experienced luckily it was only a short 50 min flight. These fares arent cheap and BA seem to be focussing more on extracting as much money as possible rather than providing a good service which is a real shame.
No staff at the transfer desk to issue boarding pass. I was told to proceed to the boarding gate for service. After one hour of waiting in a queue several people including me were finally get their passes. While we were lining up many travellers probably first and business class cut the queue to insist on going to the aircraft first. From what I feel they need a bigger crew to service the A380. Staff avoided eye contact with me to speed up their service. Food was not ready for the first meal. I had to wait half an hour for my main meal after finishing everything else. I was not offered a drink and when I asked they signalled me to wait. I waited for another half an hour without any drink from the crew yet the guy two rows in front of me asked for a refill and was offered immediately. Second meal was a total disaster it took an hour for our cabin to be served. To the point that many people who were already served they expected their trays to be cleared but nothing happened and many people took the matters into their own hands by bringing trays to cabin crew. Drinks were offered and served very minimally. I can confidently say it because my second flight later with an A350 it was a joy again. Everything ran on time. Polite and civilized boarding. No late service. I still can feel a drop in service as compared to prepandemic time.
On 14th August flight EK818 was delayed due to bad weather etc. However what followed was disappointing and highly unprofessional by Emirates Dubai Staff. Was put on EK2010 to JFK although I requested for next day EK213. Emirates lied by misinforming that none was available. Came to know later that those who shouted were accommodated. Unfortunate but it works with Emirates Suffered a lot due to due to the forced itinerary. Lost additional 500 USD in hotel reservations and bus connections Miami to Tampa. Emirates Complaint department dont have the courtesy or guts to respond.
Miami to Paramaribo via Curacao. Insel Air should be blacklisted. They rescheduled my flight twice 13 days prior departure date. They changed it a day before but the connection to my final destination is to stay overnight in Curacao without any accommodations paid by the airline. The customer service is a joke. I called to complain and demand a change back of date or help with the hotel accommodationfood or give me a refund. They said I should file a complain to Customer relations because there is nothing they could do.
I arrived at Toronto Airport 2 hours before the flight with SATA only to find out that this flight was marked as 30 minutes delayed. I waited for almost another hour at the gate and the departure time kept on being pushed back with no announcements. Eventually the plane started boarding and only after passing the gate as passengers were walking onto the plane a manager was standing there and informing passengers that the flight which was advertised and sold as a direct flight from Toronto to Lisbon would be making a stop in Punta Delgada in the Azores. There was no explanation or apology and when I told him that this would be unacceptable he simply told me that I could get off the flight if I preferred. Extremely rude. In the end the flight that stopped in Punta Delgada for an hour to pick up passengers there. We were told at one point by cabin crew that this was because there were passengers that were stranded there. But when I asked the passengers that got on the flight they said that they were not stranded at all. They were getting on the flight at the right time and had bought their tickets months in advance. What became quite clear was that the airline basically decided to divert the direct flight and passthrough Punta Delgada to make use of the empty seats on the flight and fill it up not caring at all about the inconvenience of hundreds of passengers on board. As a result my flight arrived in Lisbon 3 hours and 15 minutes late. Not only were we not offered any sort of compensation for this we were not even offered a simple apology. I should add that the food service was absolutely terrible and the quality of the meals served was poor. Upon researching this SATA after this experience I see that it has been rated the worst for customer satisfaction and I can now fully understand why. I wish I had been aware of those ratings before buying my ticket.
Very unsatisfying the airconditioning was low and the temperature too hot. Furthermore I was asked to turn off ipad even though it was in flight mode. All tourists around me used mobile phones with Bluetooth but I was denied use my ipad with Bluetooth. People should be treated equally this is not acceptable.
Istanbul to Amsterdam. It was one of my best flights on Turkish Airlines. Although the plane was not the newest one a 10 year old A330200 it was comfortable enough for such a short route. The flight entertainment system froze for 2 times but it has a enjoyable content. Ticket was cheap food was amazing and 30 kg baggage allowance was great.
Jan 2012 AMSPBM return on Airbus 340300. Excellent flights on time. Food and beverages top quality. Personal entertainment system average and not completely in working order but still acceptable.
Chicago to Skopje via Istanbul. I booked economy class tickets on Turkish Airlines and paid extra for exit row seating. Unfortunately the airline cancelled the first leg of the trip two weeks before scheduled departure. This meant I would miss my connection to my ultimate destination. I had to leave two days earlier than planned due to the cancellation. It also meant the exit row seat I paid for was no longer available. Normal businesses would refund this extra expense I paid for the exit row seating. After submitting a feedback request the airline agreed to refund the money however six months later I still have not seen a dime of that money despite tens of feedback requestsemails. The airline has delayed confused made excuses claimed no refund was needed etc. all to try and frustrate me so that I would no longer pursue the refund. I also contacted the consumer protection division of the USDOT who relayed my complaint to the airline. The airline again agreed to refund the money but now continues to make unreasonable demands for me to receive the refund. The airline claims they can not refund the credit card used to make the purchase and insist on me providing a copy of my passport and bank account information. Coincidentally I had a very similar experience on KLM about a month after my Turkish Airline flight. KLM was wonderful. They refunded my credit card within 5 days of the flight. The Turkish Airline flight was a terrible tenhour flight that was very uncomfortable. I am tall at 62 the seat was not fit for a much smaller person. The aircraft was old. The plane had decor of the 70s and 80s and many of the video screens around me were broken including mine. On the brighter side the flight crew was pleasant and the food good. Outside of the uncomfortable seat the flight would have been grand. On the return trip I did sit in an exit row and can honestly say it was a very pleasant flight. Unfortunately given my experience with the customer service and refund process I can not recommend this airline. If anything goes wrong and you expect a refund you will be frustrated. The airline does not do the right thing. It is worth paying a little more on competitor airlines
I was given a boarding pass for gate C 25 at Denver International Airport two hours before my flight. I get there and they tell me the gate has been changed to C 63. I am recovering from a pelvis fracture and knee replacement so cant walk that fast anymore. I get to C63 and the plane is still sitting there but they gave my seat away. As though the ticket I purchased doesnt count for anything Now my luggage is going to an airport I know longer have a flight to. After the fact they text me about a flight to another airport later in the day. So clearly they could have texted me when they changed the gate but didnt. This is how they treat their customers. Id rather not fly than ever have anything to do with Southwest Airlines again. They dont deserve to be in business.
Easy check in on the way to Heathrow. The flight was on time with no issues. Our return flight to Valencia was booked for the afternoon and our long haul flight arrived early at Heathrow. This was with another airline and was not a connecting flight. I asked at the British Airways check in if we could be put onto the morning flight back to Valencia to avoid seven hours waiting at Heathrow. We had our flights changed with no cost and were checked in within five minutes. That is indeed customer service. Thank you.
We flew on the A380 from Heathrow to Joburg return economy class. I thought the flight was excellent. The crew were very helpful and the meals were good. We flew in the bottom level one way but the upper level on the return I liked the upper level better. There are convenient storage units by the window seats. Keep in mind the overhead compartments are smaller upstairs though. Would definitely fly with them again.
Flight was scheduled this Friday April 28th around 1030 am was surprised not having received email for check in etc so checked their site flight cancelled and they offer a flight tomorrow Thursday 27th at around 730pm I was not informed of flight cancelled by Vueling. Had to cancel plans for tomorrow day and night in Malta I lose out on one night hotel already paid here in Malta had to cancel my transport from Paris to home and book another twice the price AND I have to book a hotel in Paris tomorrow as arriving too late. All this done last minute as Vueling didnt inform me of cancellation. Appalling. They have cost me a fortune in changes and I lose out on one day holiday and money spent.
I had the worst experience with Turkish Airlines yesterday as my first flight was delayed by 35min according Turkish staff and a promise was made by them that Istanbul was contacted previously and all the connecting flights will be waiting. In reality there was a 1.5 hours delay for a 2 hours long flight meaning I missed the connection in Istanbul only with 10 minutes. The connecting flight was still there therefore it would take only a little organization and 10 minutes to 56 people from our flight to reach it. The flight staff didnt have any information about our connection before we landed. On arriving in Istanbul there was no apology or direction of what to do actually the staff was extremely rude There was no food or drink offered just a new boarding pass and deal with the consequences. No phone call was offered to reorganize our trip just promises the hotel will provide it. Of course the hotel didnt do such thing. I know that delays happens but real customer support correct and valid information or some kindness would make it easier. Its not a service worthy of a so called quality airline and please dont call it customer care point if you dont care at all.
Brussels to Dubai. There are a lot of nice items however some details should be improved. The suite in a 777 in first is extremely well designed the wines during the flight were great including Dom Perignon of 2008 and even a First growth Bordeaux Ch Margaux 2004. Aside of the caviar despite Emirates still not give pearl spoons the food could be better. For first class it was just Ok despite the very friendly service. Emirates is very generous with the drinks in first refills dessert wines digestives. I did not ask for the breakfast it was too early for me 4.30AM Dubai time. Passengers do get a pyjama and decent amenity bag. In a 777 there are 2 restrooms for a maximum of 6 people however the space is very limited. The Belgian chocolates are replaced by some chocolates made in the UK.
Ive flied with AirAsia many times the seats are quite cramped and everything costs extra but the prices are very cheap when booked in advance. However at Kuala Lumpur Klia2 airport I got lost and had a lot of luggage so I had to use the lifts which would only take me up one floor at the time it took me ages to get to Departures. I was able to check in at the Self check in machines and I even got my luggage tags but when I arrived at the Baggage drop 5 min later the staff said that she cant accept my bags anymore the flight was leaving in 55 min. I went to complain to the Customer Service desk and the staff was very unhelpful and rude couldnt care less that I was going to miss a flight because of a few minutes error. I asked about different options and they only offered to change my flight for next day which would have cost me AUD 960 I had paid AUD 160 for my flight. I ended up sleeping at the airport and taking another flight next morning through Bali with another company which was a little cheaper than the option that they had offered me.
The most dirty airplane Ive been in gum sticked to the chairs drops of dry dirt everywhere the table is dirty also something was poured on it and wasnt cleaned.
We were flying World Traveller Plus their Premium service. What it was not was Premium. We have travelled with many airlines and lucky enough to fly Premium most times. BAs premium is the worst I have come across. The flight from Heathrow to JFK was just ok the flight back was in a plane that should not be used. Old dirty uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had one would not recline and one reclined without using the button. BA needs to look at the Premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costs. They have fallen far behind their competitors they were once my preferred airline but now I try and avoid at all costs. I would rather pay more and fly with someone else.
There was a very big queue at check in. Its a pity that passengers who check in via the internet or kiosk have to line up again for bag drop. With QANTAS the bags can be dropped of by the passengers. The plane left on time and the staff were friendly and helpful. Food had to be purchased.
Oslo to Bangkok via Doha. The boarding in Oslo was a bit chaotic. The crew welcomed me with a glass of champagne and warm nuts. I was impressed by the amazing cabin of the Boeing 787. After takeoff the crew took my orders and service was one of the quickest unfortunately my meal option went out. But not too bad I then went with the Arabic chicken for main which was amazing as a starter I chose salmon along with potato salad and for dessert they offered ice cream. The crew was amazing and friendly. They often came and brought chocolate cookies and drinks. The only thing I wish is free WiFi for Business passengers and for their Elites. Because you pay a lot money and with WiFi you could answer mails or just simply browse the web. The transfer at their Doha hub was quick and well organized. But the line for Business passengers was a bit too full. After that I went to their amazing lounge. The second flight was not as good as the first one. It was departing in the morning and arriving in the evening. They only had breakfast option and no lunch or dinner options. But at least the catered option tasted amazing and were top. The seats on the Boeing 777 fleet are a bit old and when compared to their Boeing 787 A380 and A350. Overall Qatar Airways is the best airline in Business class service.
MIAGrand Cayman return in Business. Checkin at MIA was disorganized. While there were several checkin agents on hand very few were interested in actually checking in passengers. I stood in the business class checkin queue which was a mistake because I was ignored. Finally I joined the Y class queue and was eventually taken care of. General state of checkin was apathy. Standard business class setup with eight seats up front in the 737300. Interior was reasonably clean and the small upfront cabin was spacious and comfortable. The flight left on time and arrived in GCM on time which is of primary importance after safety I suppose. The in flight service was friendly and the snack was plentiful cheese and fruit. Our bags came off the belt almost last as Miami had neglected to place priority baggage tags onto our suitcases not the case leaving GCM so that our bags were first coming off the belt in Miami upon our return a few days later. Overall a reasonably priced business class ticket very reasonable when compared to their only competitor on this route American Airlines. Service was good overall better than American.
The hard product is great. But the cabin crew doesnt bother much. Even gives you a bad feeling when you ask for a drink after dinner service. Very hostile environment for a 2.700 USD one way ticket. Food is also nothing compared to what it used to be. The cheese plate consists of 2 pieces of cucumber and two slices of carrots and 2 small cuts of tasteless cheese.
My original flight was moved to a time I couldnt get there. The flight change notification promised a refund or a flight change. I needed to change my flight to a different airport so the agent told me I would need to just book a new flight and they would issue a refund for the original flight. I went ahead and booked the new flight but never received the refund. I have tried everything I could and this company refuses to speak with me about the issue. Ive tried submitting new tickets and cases since I cant get an agent to speak with me and they decline to refund saying the flight wasnt canceled so its not eligible for a refund. I have sent screen shots of the email where the refund was promised and they are just ignoring me completely.
Porto to Montreal via Casablanca in August 2018. Horrible service. Due to some social tensions they kept postponing the time of our flight. They had to cancel the first flight to rebook us on another one. Finally we left 13 hours later. The process was so unorganized from the checkin to the boarding. Good luck if you try to reach their customer service they will ignore you. Even the airport of Casablanca is a total mess.
A decent experience. Check in was fast and easy lounge was comfortable with good food offerings. Boarding was slightly chaotic but not awful. The aircraft is wonderful with comfortable seating and leg room. IFE was good. Meal decent for a two hour flight. Had to ask for an amenity kit. Flight was basically on time. Not stellar but better than most. Wifi wasnt working.
I am just incredibly tired and sad how much difficulties Turkish Airlines caused to me. It is a so called premium airline but they were not even be able to change a flight date. It took me literally 3.5 hours on multiple phone calls to complete the data change and it was not even the date I wanted. Plus they told me that they can not transfer the extra baggage I bought to my new flight. I paid 160 USD and neither I can cancel it not I can change it to my new flight. They are forcing me to buy a new extra baggage for this new flight. If you have an alternative just stay away from Turkish Airlines at all cost. I just feel sad how disorganised and illmannered these guys are. Now my case is under review and I will visit this review to mention about the outcome which I am not expecting any customer service or quality manners anyway. Just a very sad experience.
Terrible unhelpful staff. Since checking the passport the staff was rude and impolite quite even as rude if you are a foreign we arrived 40 min later. Too long times to waste really bad experience with this airline
The rudest staff I have ever encountered. First time on Iberia. They lost my bag and would not help me to find it. The staff were rude. Never again and please avoid Iberia if you can. The customer service is appalling.
A disappointing journey My son and I are now en route from Chennai to Prague on 17 Feb. We are at the time of writing this review still stuck in Paris for 9 hours waiting for a flight to Prague. This is a Jet Airways shared with Air France. The reason given was a one hour delay in Chennai which made us miss our connecting flight. Consequently we have had to wait for 9 hours for the next connecting flight. Without as much as a courtesy of a free lunch or a drink. This isnt so much about the cost of a lunch as much as it is about caring for your passengers. Horrible wait and the last time on this airline.
This airline is worse than any airline I have ever used. Worst customer service. They charge for everything. 60 euros for not checking in online and 50 euros for each bag. Just outrageous. I am completely disgusted by this airline. I would never do myself such disservice by throwing away my money. Zero communication topped with robbery. Airline is not reliable. The plane was significantly delayed.
If you want horrible customer service and mediocre flights this is the airline for you. They can cancel or change your flight and provide no compensation we had our original flight at 825pm and got moved to a 2pm flight which ruined our whole plan when we contacted to change the flight at least to the next day they said it was not available when we ask to book us on an available KLM flight Transavia is owned by KLMAirfrance our phone was cut and our email form were just ignored 14 days and counting. The customer service will either pick up your call and pretend to not hear you. The funny thing is they put us on a KLM plane on our flight here not communicated at all and last minute I wonder how they could suddenly book that. There is no way to sugarcoat it it is a horrible airline that is extremely overpriced for the service you get.
Booked travel on the 787 and in the end they moved the flight to an A320 a very old one. Service of the cabin crew was ok. Food wise wouldnt pay that much for business if I knew they were going to serve me that. If I was not mistaken it was 2 choices chicken rice or the beef udon. Total rubbish. Seat was cramped on business too.
Uneventful ontime flight very comfortable and friendly flight attendants. Everything worked like a clock work. Enjoyed the short flight and will likely fly with them again.
JNBGRJ. The flight had a technical problem which resulted in the pax being transferred to a backup aircraft. The delay was well handled with full and clear information being given at all times as well as good humoured and sincere apologies from the flight deck. In the end we got into George just over an hour late. Congratulations and thanks for a professional and relaxed approach to the problem.
My return trip from Germany after a weekend away. Flight departed bang on time and arrived 20 minutes early. As usual efficient and straightforward service. Simple.
Bangkok to London Heathrow on British Airways. I have lived in Thailand for 4 years now and try to go back to the UK at least once a year to visit family and friends. Normally I fly either Emirates to Manchester or to Heathrow with EVA Air. This time around BA came up with a fairly competitive price. The aircraft wasnt in particularly impressive shape and inflight entertainment unit was quite outdated and didnt work for the first 2 hours of the flight. Once it did work the screen was awful and very dark. I cant fathom why BA are using outdated entertainment systems when rivals such as EVA Emirates and even Thai Airways are much more current. Inflight service was okay for the most part. Regular trips by the staff for refreshments in the first few hours but this certainly died down afterwards. After using the call system to get the attention of a staff member I was abruptly asked to switch it off and asked if I had a problem. No problem just would like a drink please. However alcohol apart from wine had ran out. Im not a massive drinker but do have a couple of whiskey and cokes on a flight. Also there was no WiFi no charge points for mobile devices. This is again in contrast with Emirates Thai Airways and EVA. All in all I have to say it was a disappointing experience. I wont be using BA again on my next flight to the UK.
Newark to Paris Orly. I booked this airline because my family and I travel to France once or twice a year. I decided to try this airline alone first. As I got closer to the departure I decided to read the reviews. As you have read there are many that are not favorable. I became nervous because I had a small window of time for my visit this summer and I didnt want to spend it with airline drama. I also want to point out that I travel 5060K miles per year domestically for work and that I am a Delta Status flyer. Previously I have flown Air France and Delta to Europe. My review of this airline is superb. The check in was uneventful the lounge was busy its summer the cabin crew were pleasant and the lite dinner salad with large shrimp was good. My arrival was on time I carried on my bags. Returning was the same on time pleasant and tasty. I am a seasoned traveller to know that things can go wrong mechanical weather unpleasant staff and inedible food. But in this case and on my flight it was a delight.
DohaKuwait 26 Oct. 2023 on a B777300. Transit in Doha went well with some testing of their new goldplatinum lounges. The lounges and airport are overstaffed to my taste. To the extend they are about to become intrusive as they have too little to do. Transfer and revised seat selection was easy with new robot machines in the lounges. After the machine reads your passport you get full overview and can print out new BP yourself. Impressive. Short evening flight less than 1 hour duration. Huge aircraft virtually full 300 pax. Briefly on time. Gate boarding functioned well through division of passengers into 4 zones. I was treated with respect and served excellently. Food and drinks were informed online prior to travel which had raised my expectations. And it was all there served a nice cold Arabian mezze nicely prepared and presented in a transparent design box separated in food sections with a spoon fixed elegantly across the sections. Softdrinks numerous but surprisingly cava champagne was served as well as wine spirits and beers. Two catering service rounds in 55 minutes is impressive. Staff competent focused polite and extremely efficient. They gave me 3 seats due to my Privilege status at their FFP. Headset blankets given. IFE and WiFi functioned well was given a headset of good quality. Even if I would have been offered a free business class seat I would not have changed it for my given 69G seat. I have a full appreciation and pleasant experience from this flight and cant fault anything. FA were well groomed well rested and in a transmitting sparkling mood. I spoke Thai with a hostess Ms. Pisolaya who was outstanding. Qatar delivers top notch at times particularly in the air. Well done QR
I havent come across a worse service than the one offered by SpiceJet. SpiceJet really needs to start managing its checkin counters better. The staff at the airport just shrugged showing zero sympathy. I entered the terminal 2 airport 1 hour 45 minutes prior but the checkin counter was closed. I didnt even get to board my flight and there was no information shared with me at all about online checkin. Besides all the promo mail there wasnt any mail about online checkin. Instead they let me all the way through to the gate and told me on the last moment that I was supposed to checkin and the website was also not clear in that I checked. The checkin counter was closed and they didnt do anything for me other than tell me that I should have known somehow. Also the flight was delayed for no reason. The flight departure time was 720 PM but it was delayed by 26 minutes. No partial refund no later flight instead nothing. only telling me that I should have known somehow what the procedure is and pointing to the terms and conditions part on my eticket which by the way says nothing about checking in. Be aware of this. No spicejet for me anymore.
Montreal to Beijing. Worst airline company this is the only Chinese airline which refused to provide full refund for tickets cancelled before Jan 28. The government set up policies about refunding but this firm is just playing word games.
MH you can do better Why so lousy the service I had rice with chicken basil. The basil was so salty The bun given was so hard like a rock. So was the pineapple. What happened to food MA Also I was just given one helping of apple juice. Stewardess did not bother to asked if needed a second helping or so. No passion in doing their job. Not bothered to check if the chair was upright upon landing. What happened
London to Manila via Hong Kong. We booked our flights via this airline because it was the best value and good flight times. All four flights were excellent. Staff at all stages were friendly and helpful the food was pretty good plenty of leg room and huge amount of choice of inflight entertainment. Not at any stage of our travels did we find an issue or find anything didnt meet our expectations. Great value flights would definitely use again and recommend to others dont be put off by the bad reviews. Cheap and cheerful.
GatwickTampa. Check in simple lounge at Gatwick average aircraft B777. Clean and departed on time. On board pleasant welcome food just about ok after some research chose seat 4K window you wont disturb anyone getting out. But have to agree with mostly everyone else that seats are small and facing a stranger is quite odd. Cabin crew excellent flight crew informative through out the flight which landed on time. Anyone booking Business as opposed to Eco or Eco plus should know that all you are really paying extra for is a cramped flat seat and allowance of 3x32kg bag checked in instead of 2x23kg in Eco. Good films to choose from but music naff as is the screen. Brought my own in ear Bose IQ20 headset Excellent for flights.
HKGKHH round trip with A330. Well maintained and clean for such a short flight KA still offered some food and beverages HKGKHH delayed 2 hrs for unknown reason no information provided cabin crew rude not really helpful. Ill try CI or BR next time
Flew TK 5 22 MAR Istanbul Chicago in business class. Had requested AVML Asian vegetarian Meal. TK had forgotten my special AVML meal. On board they served boiled eggplant tomato sauce and disgusting rice as THE main course. I refused to eat and returned my plate. No alternative food offered. I spoke to the cabin chief who expressed she was sorry and agreed that the meal served was not even close to AVML. Spoke to the chef on board who had no clue what AVML looks like. Starved for 12 hour flight. Cabin chief and the chef promised they would report this incident but it seems it did not go anywhere. I am an Elite Plus member of Turkish Airlines and it seems they do not care about their premium cabin passengers. Surprisingly cabin chief is TKs employee and the chef are employed by DO CO catering company who provided meals for TKs passengers. Complained about the incident and response I got was we regret and no compensations given. It will be hard to choose TK for future travel.
Flew to Mumbai and back via Dubai on Emirates and all flights were comfortable. There was a delay on the last leg back to Heathrow due to a technical issue and whilst the communication could have been better we were given a food voucher which was very much appreciated. The issue was rectified reasonably quickly and the captain made up time en route so we arrived late but not excessively so. Cabin crew were efficient although varied depending on the sector flown. Generally they were cheerful and friendly. Food was fine and the IFE has a huge amount of choice. Despite the delay on the last leg it was still a pleasure flying with Emirates.
Absolute garbage airline. I flew my wife out with my 1 year old daughter buying tickets a week in advance. Not only was it 3x normal rate. When my wife got to the gate they took her stroller to baggage claim a stroller we flew with many times on different airlines claiming its not allowed on theirs. I spoke with a customer care agent who was non stop telling me their policy is against strollers on board. So I found their policy online on their site and had to prove them wrong. My wife got stuck on a 6 hour transfer stroller less. No service. As everyone knows no refunds. God awful company how and why people fly with them is beyond me but once for me is enough I wish I read the reviews earlier. Movies on a 2000 flight cost money meal is god awful. Stay away.
Departure LGW north so Aspire lounge. Bag from fine lounge basic on time departure. Cabin crew welcoming but only given menu water and amenity pack. Looks like some of White Company bedding options removed. Lunch was fine and good pre meal drinks service. Not complete return to old days but getting there. Flight generally good. Early touch down. Club world luggage off last which meant a wait of 75 minutes for luggage
I have been using Eastern Airways for about a year now traveling between Humberside and Aberdeen for Business. I started to notice that when I booked some flights it would say only 4 seats left and I would have to pay the middle tier over 200 one way It was always the case I got on the flight to find that there would be about 11 people on there and plenty of empty seats what extra did I get for the higher price nothing same seat as the 165 one nothing different. After spending a lot of money with this airline I now travel on train to another airport and I can get 2 flights 2 trains for less then the lowest fare available with Eastern Airways even flying across the sea I can get cheaper then a domestic flight. Trouble is some people are stuck and have to use the local airport but if the prices do not start to come down they will end up pushing everyone to other airports and little airports like Humberside will end up closing. Its just greed if other airlines can fly at 60 a seat for a domestic flight then why cant they I will not be using again.
Cucuta to Palonegro. SATENA is a Colombian regional carrier that offers good connectivity to remote regions of the country and also serves big cities. Pleasant experience with courteous staff punctual departure and arrival wellorganised boarding and luggage delivery. The airline has been around for over 50 years but is normally overlooked. It is an excellent choice for domestic travel within Colombia.
This was the final flight of our ill conceived use of Scoot to fly to and from Vietnam. This was yet another flight that was rescheduled without advice to us by Scoot. Our original booking would have seen us travel from Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore to Perth in the course of a day rather than have an enforced stopover of 18 hours in Singapore which allowed time to eat bathe and sleep before returning to the airport. Boarding was disorganised and the flight was delayed upon departure by about an hour. Our pre booked seats were changed without advice and we ended up four rows from the toilets at various times there was the overpouring stench of stale urine in the cabin. both my partner and I used the toilets and prior to her being able to use them she had to do a clean with disinfectant wipes and tissues. Disgraceful it reflects poorly on the airline cabin crew and our fellow passengers personal hygiene practices. None of our flights with Scoot departed on schedule each flight was re scheduled without notification to us. What is unfortunate about this experience is part of our decision was based upon past travel with Singapore Airlines Scoots parents company. It is not a good look to be associated with such a poorly operated and managed low cost carrier who has little care or concern for its passengers. In Singapore Airlines case its association with Scoot is a race to the bottom. Scoot is little more than riding a public bus.
Avoid like the plague. Ground crew is not helpful. We were unable to check in online due to a WiFi failure on the airport. We expected some consideration from the Ryanairstaff. After a rather unpleasant conversation we had to pay 100 for our boarding passes. But they only accepted credit cards which we didnt have. So we couldnt fly. Staff were icecold. Thats how they are trained. Finally a friend paid for us. But we had already missed our flight because of this. Now we had to rebook our tickets. Of course again we received the emotionless treatment of the staff and an extra 200 pounds lighter we were finally able to leave London Stansted Airport. Ryanair takes advantage of the fact people dont own a credit card and they do this on purpose. Its just a low strategy to make a bit of extra money.
I booked a flight from Lisbon to Cluj via Bucharest both flights with Blue Air. In Lisbon I was only issued the boarding pass for LisbonBucharest. Upon arrival in Bucharest with a 1h layover I was told I had not checked in and need to go to the agency and pay for my checkin. Mine was not the only such issue. I finally paid 40 eur for the checkin and nearly missed my flight.
Worst Flight to travel. The flight was 3 hours delay and there was no proper instructions given. The flight was also dirty. The worst flight I ever traveled and I will not suggest anyone to travel with this one
Suzanne and her associates were awesome in service. There was a unruly and abusive traveller sitting near me and they made sure he didnt hurt anyone and tried their best to ensure he was amicable as possible. The traveller should not have been travelling alone. Suzanne continually ensured I was ok and appreciated that I had to deal with this person for a long flight.
Birmingham to Dubrovnik. We boarded on time we were surprised as we paid for extra leg room and they were all gone apart from two seats but meant we couldnt sit together. On the way back we managed to book them. On the way good flight but I noticed about 6 seats extra leg room were empty. After a quick word with the stewardess we were able to move and sit together. Comfy seats we didnt pay for anything on refreshments or food as well its a rip off. Flight home on time but Dubrovnik was very windy as not the most confident passenger the captain did say it was going to be a rough take off. Yes it was not a good experience but something that was out of their control. Apart from that a good flight home. Air stewards ok a bit snooty which I find most of the time. I would personally use again.
I have went with Novair four times OSLLPA x2 OSLTFS OSLFUE. Great service good looking planes comfortable seats. No delays new clean A321. The only less good thing the food.
QantasLinks Dash 8 was flying on this route Rockhampton to Brisbane head to head with Virgins Embraer 170 jet but the QantasLink propjet offered a pleasant alternative. Checkin was easy. Once on board the seats were comfortable enough for this short flight the plane was on time and service was friendly. We were given a snack pack that contained quite an array of nibblies ranging from a salami stick to a small chocolate frog. It wasnt possible to specify a vegetarian meal on this sector but the snack pack offered plenty to eat. This was a late afternoon flight and the drinks service included wine and beer with even a topup if you could manage it on this 70min flight. All in all a fun experience.
Singapore to Davao. Pretty decent flight with a very well organized crew Happy to serve and with a smile from crew members. The style of the seats is a bit old fashioned color of the seats. There is no entertainment on the plane but you can connect to the WiFi and get the movies on your device but only if you have the SilkAir app Silk air should let us know in advance before you get a 530h flight.
Paris CDG to Kansai Osaka with Air France. The new business class cabin configuration of Air France is absolutely incredible. Obliquely orientated with a removable panel in the middle seats. Completely flat bed and comfortable without uncomfortable divisions on the seat. Plenty of space with private locker. The food was very sophisticated but not completely tasty. KLM and Air France has the same inflight entertainment system so after a couple of flights the selection is a little bit boring. Very few latest releases.
Melbourne to Singapore. This was our first time flying Premium Economy and my expectation was for Singapore Airlines was to provide an exceptional experience. Firstly the boarding in Melbourne was good the ground and cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Plenty of legroom and nice comfortable seats. Noisecancelling headphones were supplied although my wife had to ask for them as they werent at her seat. The back of the seat in front was a bit grubby and I used an antiseptic wipe to clean it there were some other grubby bits around the armrest and tray table. Champagne was offered and gratefully accepted. The meal service was prompt although it was just an economy meal. I was hoping for something a little better as I paid double the economy ticket price. Wine was offered however only one red and one white I dont like Sauvignon Blanc and that was the only white. I did ask the flight attendant for a Chardonnay and she was very obliging and managed to find a glass for me. Big Plus The flight was comfortable and the crew were outstanding. It makes a difference when the crew are customerfocused. Overall a good experience. Two things ditch the Sauvignon Blanc and provide an upgraded Premium Economy meal.
Paris to Newark. Sitting in a lounge for hours without any information. We are told that there are delays due to possible mechanical trouble. Feeling absolutely ignored. Will never fly with this airline again
The single worst airline I have ever flown with in my whole life. I have flown with Ryanair about a dozen times and probably 10 of them were late by more than an hour. Not to mention the inexcusably rude treatment customers receive. Unprofessional. It may be cheap but it feels even cheaper than it is. Cherry on top had to wait another hour for the suitcase.
Travelling during the covid19 times. Checkin on the counter was pretty smooth cannot say the same for the app. First leg was pretty full anout 8085 we left Entebbe with a slight delay. Was lucky that I was in a window seat with nobody next to me so the flight was pretty comfortable. The food was ok water juice 2 small baguettes 1 cheese 1 chicken chocolate cake. Prepacked and really quick to hand out. It is known that they are nonalcohol but they also did not offer coffee or tea. Cabin crew did the service quickly food covid measures and immigration info and then came out again before landing. The transit time was pretty tight 1 hour and with a short delay I doubted I would catch the next flight. Cairo airport is not that big but finding your way when hurried can be hard. After going to the transfer desk I was rushed to my next flight which had almost boarded. With the assistance of the ground crew me and another fellow passenger made it. The 2nd leg was about 25 full. Identical service. They offer a pack in every flight which contains alcohol gel alcohol wipes 2 masks and gloves. Landing was smooth however my luggage did not find its way to the 2nd flight and it remained in Cairo. Did a declaration and it was delivered to my door after 2 days. All in all a rather good experience there were problems but the company managed to assist overcoming them.
An 11 hour flight with just a 33cl water bottle just pasta a la bolognese. Worse long flight ever for some that doesnt eat meat and is used to drink at least 2l of water per day.
LGWVRNLGW both in Club Europe. Was offered an upgrade on the way out for 85. Swift checkin as Gatwick was quiet at 6.30am. Used the Galleries loungereasonable cold food selection but the only hot option was porridge. Nice atmosphere though and good views of the runway. Left slightly late due to congestion. Nice breakfast with individual bottles of Heidseck Monopole champagne. No aerobridges at Verona so had to walk to a bus in the rain. Bags delivered quickly. Return flight was delayed by an hour as the incoming flight was late. BA use the Catullo lounge which is very poor with an abysmal selection of foodnothing hot not even a sandwich just biscuits and pastries at 9pm The lounge is before the security check so not able to relax altogether. Crew very apologetic about delay speedy drinks and meal servicethe chicken curry was passable.
My partner and I flew Dublin to Seattle via London Heathrow with British Airways. Heathrow to Seattle was on a B777200 which was slightly dated and seats were rather cramped making it impossible to sleep on a 910hr flight. Online checkin wasnt possible and we werent able to select our seats as our booking had an Iberia flight number even though it was operated by BA. Made lengthy phone calls and same response was given that nothing could be done about it until the airport. Arrived early at airport to find plane was overbooked so my partner and I didnt get our seats together ground staff could do nothing about it. Luckily we were able to swap with another passenger once on board. Food was bland to say the least possibly the worse on any carrier Ive ever flown with. However service provided by cabin crew was excellent. Would only fly BA again for this.
London to Milan. Evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty. Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overhead. Free newspapers were available in the jet way. Passengers were warmly greeted. I was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. Usual on board trolley service which I didnt use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late. Return flight could have been a challenge due to Italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer outstanding. We were taken off the aircraft and bussed into T5 which I think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control. All in all a couple of very good flights.
I had booked business class with my friend as this particular trip was planned to mark a significant milestone in my life my 50th birthday. On this occasion I had invested in an upgrade and as such I expected nothing less. For 15 hours on an overnight flight I had to sit in economy whilst my colleague was in business class. I was downgraded as BA overbook their flight by 10. Their offer of compensation was 200 I am also waiting almost one month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class. This experience has caused undue stress and at this point I am reluctant to use their services in the future. Their dismissive response completely contradicts their consumer promise and values Meeting the rising expectations of our customers remains central to our strategy of transforming British Airways into the worlds leading global premium airline. Our investment in our staff our fleet and our facilities are all about making sure we provide the very best in customer service. The experience with BA has resulted in a negative end to what was a bucket list holiday I feel I have a duty of care to other consumers to share my experience
Before you step into the cabin they offer 3 choices of the newspaper two in Chinese and one in English. When you step into the cabin the first impression of this flight is the uniform of the flight attendant. The old one looks more stylish and professional. The latest one looks childish. On the upside you can expect a warm smile and a clear instruction where your seat from KA crew. The leg room of my seat is ok consider I am just 170cm tall. For entertainment I must say there is a lot of choices. Most of the movies are just being shown lately and other than the movie you can find some latest TV series as well as the documentary show. Of course there are games to play. Speaking of the catering I am not much into the food but compared to other Hong Kong base carrier KA offer more choice and better quality. I mean who doesnt like Haagen Daz ice cream
Paris CDG to Tokyo Haneda. Exceptional service end to end from the La Premiere lounge I was taken in a car direct to the aircraft and introduced to the flight attendant. Krug was offered upon boarding and she made sure I knew what to expect for the flight. There are 4 first class seats and all were taken. The FA ensured we got the privacy we required by drawing the curtains what a concept part way. The food service was outstanding I opted to forgo the caviar I dont like the stuff and went for the lentil and coriander soup which was delicious. I then had the filet this was perfectly served rare in the middle and very moist. The Saint Honore dessert listed in the menu wasnt available so I was offered an apple tart this too was superb. While I changed into my pyjamas the FA made up my bed. The curtains were fully closed and I dozed off quickly. I woke up after 3 hours feeling rather hot the pyjamas were extremely efficient. If I have a complaint its that I think the cabin is a bit airless with the curtains closed. Id like the ability to create some air movement but thats a nitpick. I dont do breakfast so I just had a pot of coffee. On arrival at Haneda I was handed over to my personal airport escort. All in all I believe this is the finest 1st class service out there.
ManchesterErcan via Bodrum. Outbound flight was on time aircraft was fit for purpose. A meal was served and soft drinks were free again ok. Asking for wine was a prolonged process. crew were changed at Bodrum and no service was offered. The return flight was on time but after a night stay at Ercan I expected a clean plane which was not the case. As the outbound flight ran out of milk this flight had no bread rolls yet clearly meant to. The cabin crew suggested the jam was for the chocolate cake Surly crew no please or thank you. Very disappointed but no choice of other carrier.
Albrook Panama City to Bocas del Toro. After reading comments about this airline I was a bit worried but our flight with Air Panama was really okay. Checkin at the airport was quick there were no lines. My bag was 17 kg so I had to pay 9 dollars for the 3 kg overweight. Totally fine. There are no infoscreens at the small airport of Albrook but as there are only leaving a couple of flights a day its obvious when boarding starts. The flight left at 2.30 so right on time. The fokker 50 used for this flight is old but seatpitch was okay for this 55 minute flight to Bocas. After a loud and bumpy take off the crew handed out some crisps and a soda. After 35 minutes of cruising with some wonderful views at the rainforest and Caribbean beaches the pilot started decent into Bocas airport. After a soft landing and a short taxi to the small apron our luggage appeared within minutes. We really enjoyed this flight in this old air Panama fokkerairplane.
On our way from Addis Ababa en route to Toronto aircraft broke down at Dublin at 500AM and was grounded. Pilot announced aircraft had a Hydraulic Pump Failure and could not fly same Day since they needed spares. So we were taken into the Lounge Room at Dublin. We were kept in Lounge room for 11 hours without anything to eat not even a cookie. There was no Ethiopian Airlines Staff present. I tried to go into the main airport area but I was stopped by Airport security we were not allowed to leave the Lounge Room. So we just kept there from 500AM till 500PM when we were told there was another aircraft which came to take us. I had a connecting flight which was to depart at 150 PM but we arrived 700PM so I had missed the Flight. On the last aircraft I asked the Crew to avail me with internet and me willing to pay so I can email West Jet and let them know I wont be able to make it for my flight and the Crew Lady told me its for paying and I said I am paying then she said that I dont need to worry because many people are going to miss their flight so we are communicating with our Head Office so when you get to Toronto just go to our Desk and they will book you your connecting Flight. When I got to Toronto the Staff told me if I missed my flight its not their fault and I had to spend the night on a bench next to Ethiopian Airlines Desk at Toronto Airport Then I found my own way to get home and there after raised my complaint to Ethiopian Airlines.
Flew BA to Munich. Quick checkin good boarding sandwich wasnt the best evening meal I have ever had but adequate on a short flight. Good crew. Exemplary crew on return flight. Nice airbus with comfy leather seats. Both flights on timeslightly early.
In the second leg of my flight from BAH to CDG as there was no cabin space my 3 cabin bags were collected by staff in the flight and told us that they will keep it in cargo and give us back in CDG airport before we get down from the flight. As they have confirmed that they are not checking the bags in and keeping it in CARGO they havent given us any receipt or bag tags. When enquired with flight Attendant in CDG she insisted that the bags will reach our final destination i.e. DFW in this instance even though bag tags are not available. But the bags havent reached our final destination. Its been more than 6 days since my date of travel 15th Jan 2023 but my bags havent reached me. The baggage department is also very unresponsive even though i have given my bags description to them. I feel that the staff who has collected our bags in BAH should have informed the flight attendant that these are the bags to be handed over in CDG. With this horrible experience not resolved i would rather pay more for a ticket than journey through Gulf Air again.
Flew Houston to Manchester. A wonderful experience the stewards and stewardesses were very helpful and sensitive to our needs at all times. The food was excellent every meal was hot and tasty and served with a smile. We had a little turbulence along the way but the Captain came on and reassured everyone. I will definitely fly Singapore Airlines again.
British Airways flight from Glasgow to London Heathrow under Iberia code IB7519. Boarding was prompt and a very nice welcome from the crew. The flight left on time and arrived early at T5. The seat was comfortable and the meal served was breakfast which was very good. Several rounds of coffee and tea served. Very good flight.
Recent trip from Brussels to Cancun. I originally had the flight booked through Aeromexico on the way there I flew from Cancun to Madrid with a stop in Mexico City but we needed to change the flight and the change cost more than buying a new ticket. After searching we bought 2 one way tickets for a direct flight Brussels Cancun for less than 400 Euros so we were not sure what to expect. We couldnt have made a better choice. The airplane had bigger seats than Aeromexico that actually let you stretch food and staff was good and the timing was perfect. The variety of movies on the screens was fantastic. We could have upgraded for only 100 Euros more to Business Class but honestly seats were so good we didnt feel the need.
Flew Heathrow Madrid return. Have always been loyal to BA but no longer. T5 Lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere not particularly pleasant. Bags not tagged priority. Fast Track not fast. Service on board to Madrid was exceptionally good and old style BA. Return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out. Very disappointing experience and unacceptable. Could not select seats online for return flight as computer had allocated them. Eventually seats changed when called call centre told couldnt be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it. Waste of time and energy. Practically everything suggested as part of the Club Europe package didnt happen. Club Europe used to be so distinctive and worth and I always felt it was worth the premium price. To be honest I have cheaper alternatives from closer airports which I will now be using for my regular flights to and from Spain.
We traveled with Air France and had nothing but issues. We had a cracked screen in row 12L. The USB port was damaged and the WiFi for the flight did not work. We landed in Boston on the evening of 15th May and waited for baggage claim only to not see our luggage. Staff told us to scan a QR code and fill it out. This is not customer service nor what they get paid to do. Our luggage is still missing.
Kolkata to Doha on 7 September. The flight scheduled to depart at 0330 was delayed and nobody informed passengers that the flight was delayed to 8am in the morning and we have been obliged to spend the night at airport. The delay was not announced. The Qatar staff at Kolkata airport did not show up until very late. If the staff was there at 12am they should have offered to us to spend the night in a hotel but when they arrived was obviously too late. I received the next morning at 10.22 am the message on my phone that the flight was delayed i.e. after the flight had already left. I wrote a letter of complaint to the airline but no compensation was offered. I requested a diabetic meal and they forgot it.
I booked a group of 11 passengers on a flight from Don Mueang to Taipei. The flight was scheduled to leave at approximately 130AM. For some reason the flight was delayed for well over 2 hours. Not much of an explanation was provided. Due to the flight delay our group missed their connecting flight in Taipei. Had the flight left on time we had 4 hours to make our connecting flight. With the extensive flight delay we were unable to make that connection. The V Air staff were not very helpful at all in trying to contact our connecting flight airline to see how we might be able to make our connection. Their customer service response to a request for an explanation on what happened and why more assistance wasnt provided was useless. I have pasted their response below Dear Tim According to our policy Vair has no compensation for flight delay less than 4 hours. Apologize for any inconvenience caused. Sincerely yours V Bear. Not very helpful at all. I certainly will not be flying with V Air ever again in the future.
Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai. First flight on time boarding done very efficiently due to empty flight. Crew were very nice telling passengers sat in full rows that there were free rows scattered around the plane that they could move to. Plane was brand new great seats great entertainment system. Food was 5050. On time arrival into Dubai but delayed due to having to go to a remote stand and taking a bus that took 40 minutes to get to the terminal. Got to the terminal and realised I left my onwards boarding pass on the plane but the staff issued me a new one very quickly. Second flight boarded on time as well however we were an hour late taking off due to the weather but the crew made up for it. Like the first flight crew were excellent and the food was a lot better on the 2nd leg. Sat on the upper deck definitely recommend it as the more private cabin and the side compartments are really good. Overall great experience with Emirates.
London to Doha was delayed at Heathrow. Finally boarded the flight and sat there for more than an hour before being told there were issues with the plane. Later deplaned and told another plane was being prepared. As we were trying to leave we got told to go back to our seats and that they might have fixed the issue. More time has passed and we were finally told it was going to take off. By the time we had left Heathrow it was delayed 5 hours. This meant I had missed my connecting flight to Sydney. On the plane the entertainment system at my seat didnt work. The touch screen failed and I had to move to the adjacent seat that was empty and use that screen. Food was okay inflight service was good. Upon landing in Doha had my boarding pass taken from me and given a new one. I was not given any sort of compensation to use a lounge got told to speak with the transfer desk. The flight from Doha to Perth which I was being redirected to was delayed by 2 hours. When I got to Perth to my shock horror I was put on Jetstar Airways instead of a partner plane like Qantas. The Jetstar plane was also delayed by 2hrs. I was supposed to arrive in Sydney at 6pm on a Friday I arrived instead at 8am on Saturday. I was only offered statutory compensation after I have still yet to receive. I not received a refund on the upgraded seats I paid for but was not able to use because of the delays.
Flight was cancelled due to covid. Still no refund after one year and lots of mails asking a refund. I wont ever book Oman Air again.
My wife and I went from London Gatwick to Tampa on 6th November 2014. From our previous flights to this destination we knew already that there was not very much to expect. Old 777 plane. Loud tired staff not really interested just working on automatic. The seats were old dirty and shabby looking. No space cold and freezing on the legs. The very old screens in the seats are just a nightmare to watch. Broken sound systems. The food topped the whole experience. Just awful Full of preservatives. Very degrading even when you sit in the so called wooden Class. Over the last 3 years I have been flying to Tampa nothing has been changed by BA.
Had very bad experience with rerouted and cancelled flights last weekend with Adria airways. Original Route was Ljubljana to Sarajevo return. Two weeks before i received an email that the flight was cancelled. Offered route change was Ljubljana to Sarajevo via Munich. Flight back changed to SarajevoPristinaLjubljana. I accepted. The first flight via Munich was ok. Two hours before the return flight I got the email that the flight was cancelled. I had to rebook via hotline and had to accept a flight with Croatian to Zagreb. I reached Ljubljana 4 h later and had to organize Transport from Zagreb to Ljubljana on my own cost. Do not book flights with Adria airways. I heard that their financial situation is very very bad.
Goa to Warsaw via Doha. Qatar Airways is a good airline but I lowered my rating as our flight was delayed and feel the ground crew could have handled the situation better. They did however accommodate us in a very good hotel about an hour away for 5 hours before we had to leave back for the airport. Also having kids in the group would have expected to make our transit in Doha a little more comfortable considering that our transit time was 5 hrs which is 3 hrs more than the original time. I have flown before on Qatar Airways and been a good experience everytime but this one time I was really knackered as we begun our journey at 0.30 hrs on 1111 and ended it 34 hrs later.
We were simply flying from Tortola to St. Martin. First the plane was hours late. Second we get there and just a few of us got off the plane. We sat at baggage claim. No bags came off the plane. The flight left with all of us still standing there with no luggage and no one at all in the baggage area or answering the phone. A very nice security guard let me out so I could go to their front desk. The people there were beyond rude and laughed because I couldnt get back into baggage claim the security guard let me in. They refused to answer my questions or to even call anyone. About ten minutes after I went back the claim area everyones bags arrived.
I flew from Frankfurt to Istanbul and I had an option of one night stay in Istanbul. I went to customer service desk after going through customs and getting a visa. I claimed to get a hotel as I did want to continue my journey to Saudi Arabia and I was feeling nauseous. I spoke with Turkish Airlines agent she told me she has a later flight then the manager came telling me that they have a hospital upstairs.
Miami to Rio de Janeiro. Would never fly with this airline again. We booked airfare on this airline from Miami FL to Rio de Janeiro we had booked a cruise that was leaving from Rio the cruise was canceled and when we tried to receive a travel voucher for future travel we had nothing but problems. We purchased premium business class tickets and the paperwork we were provided stated we had one year in which to use the voucher. After going back and forth with the agents too many times to count we were finally given a voucher in the amount of 1274.34 which we used for a trip to Punta Cana leaving a balance of 694.46. Have lodged many complaints with the company and they do not respond. Use caution if you have to book with this company obviously they are a low cost airline for a reason.
Flew from LHR to BKK return last week on premium economy. Overall a pleasant flight and will definitely recommend it again. Of course its not as good as their business class but it represents great value. Check in at both Heathrow and Bangkok were super efficient. At Bangkok despite there being multiple flights leaving at the same time to Europe and Taipei the check in lanes for business and premium economy were empty and the check in process took less than 5 minutes. This is far superior than most of the European business class check in experience BAAir France and KLM in particular. Flights took off on time and landed ahead of schedule. The seat itself was very comfortable I found the seat to be more spacious than those on Cathay Pacific. Service on the outbound flight was efficient and standard but on the way back the crew was very friendly and professional. The plane was clean food was tasty and the crew walked around the cabin few times offering water and food post main meal. There is never a long queue for the toilet. The big let down with EVA is the limited choice of movieTV programme. I was lucky I found a Taiwanese TV drama that I wanted to watch otherwise youd better preload your ipad with Netflix or BBC Iplayer. There was also an incident when we landed in Bangkok. Due to heavy thunder and rain the airport ground service was suspended but no information was given. Had to wait for 2 hours for the luggage to come out. Compared with my last EVA premium economy flight 2 years ago I personally feel that sadly the service has declined although its still above most of the airlines premium economy. The toilets in premium economy on my previous flight was spotless and I think they have reduced the frequency of cleaning. Nevertheless EVA is still a great option to fly to Asia from USEurope. Their business and premium class products and services are will above the competitors.
Kuwait to Kathmandu via Sharjah. The staff in boarding pass counter were rude and didnt issue my pass until it was 45 min for take off which mean I have to run. This much was fine but at the end of flight in Kathmandu when I collect my luggage i found it was damage and same time I fill up the form for the claim and after a week I got a reply saying Ill be compensated half of the amount of the luggage. Then never hear from the baggage department. So all I can suggest is never use this airline. We pay for the flight which means we trust them for our bags and everything but all I can say is they doesnt care. And Im sure they really dont care
Manchester to Los Angeles. Really impressed with the flight. I was dreading the 11 hour flight but the cabin was spacious decent legroom the staff were really efficient and friendly and the food was edible frequent though better on the way out their us supply chain has a way to go. Decent selection of films if you upgrade only 5 tv and music. I would recommend Thomas Cook if you can get a good deal but if go with virginBA if its a similar price. On the flight back we were given a pillowblanket each night flight and the toilets were down a set of stairs so a good space to stretch the premium films were all free on the way back. I think if a good sleep is an absolute necessity pay for premium as the seats looking to recline more and looking more comfortable.
Beijing to Pyongyang return. The plane was clean and well presented. Checkin service was impersonal but satisfactory. The food was good. Both flights left and arrived right on time. A shame the airline doesnt fly more routes.
Terrible customer and online service. We are trying to book additional extra checkedin luggage for the flight back to London from Penang and the online manage boking is a disaster. When it comes to paying for the additional extra luggage the site does not accept various different debit cards provided displaying all types of error codes when you try. When I was finally able to pay via Paypal the transaction had gone through and money taken out of my account. However even though money had left the account the service extra checkin luggage was still unconfirmed on the website and still required being paid for. This lead to the subsequent nightmare that is Malaysia airlines customer service that requires multiple attempts at ringing them with long wait times due to the calls ending without a resolution to the issue. This literally wasted hours of our time on vacation spent trying to contact Malaysia Airlines to resolve the issue and induced unnecessary stress for something that should have been relatively straight forward. Overall I am not impressed at all with Malaysia Airlines and will not be flying with them again.
We must be extremely lucky but our two flights with Intercaribbean on different routes and different dates were both fantastic. Last week we fly from Saint Vincent to Barbados we started and arrived early Same this week from Barbados to Grenada. We were up and landing in no time our bags made it super quick the crew were professional and polite. For flights lasting barely 30 minutes we did not expect either entertainment or service so it was all as expected. The only thing is that given that we purchased tickets a couple of days before trip date they were quite expensive. I guess they are a great company for interisland flights but one should not buy connecting flights to elsewhere for the same day.
Avoid Asianas HonoluluIncheon route. Super old aircraft with a six inches IFE screen. Very limited entertainment around 10 movies in total that you dont even want to watch because the screen is small and old. I dont understand why Asiana will deploy an old aircraft with limited entertainment for a long haul flight. Please use these old aircrafts for short hauls. The only saving grace was the food Delicious and more than enough in terms of quantity. Two full meals for a 9hour flight.
Singapore to Tioman Island. We found the check in staff very welcoming friendly and helpful The flight in the dash7 was what real flying is all about. Again the crew were very friendly.
Flew with British Airways for the first time from Sydney to London return. Very unsatisfactory compared to premium economy experiences with other airlines. Had to pay to preselect seats and not only was there no priority boarding the World Traveller Plus customers in fact were the last to board. There were only 6 rows of premier economy yet was told that the meal choice has ran out. The meal took me back to air travel in the 1970s. The starter consisted of 6 tasteless pasta spiral and 1 cherry tomato. The fish was dry and tasteless and the rice an unappetising grey colour. The dessert was a square of plain cheesecake. Hot beverages at breakfast were served in thin paper cups. There was no other service no offer of water or snacks between the meals. Toiletry consisted of hand wash and nothing else. The toilets were not cleaned and replenished during the stop over in Singapore. The seat was comfortable enough but has only a foot rest rather than the leg rest of other airlines. BA World Traveller Plus is certainly not value for money and I will not travel with them again.
My flights were cancelled. I tried to call both London UK and Toronto Canada Contact Centre and was unsuccessful. I tried many times in different times of the day even at midnight. It was just a long wait on the phone. I got a queue number when I first connected like queue number 65 and then no more indication or update of the status for how long one has to wait. I spent more than 30 mins each call but never get through to speak to someone. I wrote to different channels of LOT but none is helpful. I dont know why they issued voucher currency that even their own shopping cart does not accept. I asked them to change voucher currency into their shopping cart currency they said not possible. Their canned answer is book through contact centre only. Day after days call and write to LOT until my vouchers expired. I lost all my money. How can they issue vouchers in currency that their shopping cart not accept How can they honour their vouchers when their contact centre so inaccessible
Fly economy and youll be paying more for an awful service. The London to Vancouver route uses old planes the oldest inflight entertainment systems and my food was inedible.
Singapore to Johannesburg. Daylight flight on A350 in premium economy. Checkingin and boarding was quick and efficient with a warm welcome onboard as is the norm with Singapore Airlines. There is generous locker space in premium economy sufficient to allow blankets pillows etc not immediately required to be stowed. Drinks and nuts were served shortly after take off with champagne offered but unfortunately served in a tiny plastic faux champagne glass. We had ordered lunch from book the cook. The quality was good but would be so much better if served on proper plates and not in foil dishes. It is unfortunate that Singapore provide only economy service in premium economy. Drinks were offered with the meal but again served in small plastic tumblers. Wine was simply red or white and of mediocre quality. No refills were offered and when trays were collected some time later a requested refill never materialised. With a good choice of entertainment and a comfortable seat the 11 hour flight seemed to pass quite quickly. The crew came round on a number of occasions with water and fruit and a second hot meal was provided 2 hours before landing. Overall it was a very pleasant flight. The small premium economy cabin is very pleasant and the A350 is a very nice aircraft. However it is unfortunate that the enhanced level of service expected in premium economy is not provided.
We went to Djerba on 5th of May. This has got to be the worst airline I have ever been with. The plane was old and grubby toilets needed a good clean. The crew served drinks once no alcohol even though there is a price list in their inflight magazine. No duty free the crew sat in the galley most of the flight their English was poor. The only plus side was that the plane was newer on the way home but still rubbish service and rude crew.
Poorly mismanaged services this time. Disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters had to wait around 1.5 hours just to check in. Then came the boarding again had to wait at the passage for 1530 mins. Finally when we thought things are better now on reaching London our next boarding pass was not scanned. Around 1520 passengers including me had to wait from 7.45 am until 1.40 am for the next flight. On boarding the next flight no space to keep the luggage. Journey was really hectic and did not expect this from BA.
East London to Johannesburg. After being warned of recurrent Kulula delays i decided to take a chance then boom. Flight is delayed no apology offered by airline no food offered since its only a 2 hour delay. Who pays for this one. I do not recommend such an airline that cannot manage time.
London to Lahore via Doha. A380 to Doha then Boeing 787 to Lahore.Both flights on time. Seats on aisle reasonable leg room. Cabin crew efficient and pleasant and meals were OK for Economy. Transfer between flights at Doha is always good and easy. Arrival in Karachi is less organisedslow and crowded
Flew business class in Feb to New Delhi and back in March from Delhi to Vancouver. Aircraft is old and the seats didnt work. All broken. No TVs and the food was bad expected a better service when flying business class. Cant imagine what economy would be. Bathroom were dirty no soap or napkins. It seems like they dont really care knowing that People like to fly direct and they are the only option. Will not fly Air India again. Overhead bins were opening during turbulence. Felt very unsafe. On another note staff did try their best and were very polite.
Missed outward leg of a return flight due to issue with KA website. Accepted loss here though honestly feel website more than 50 responsible. Problem was return leg automatically cancelled. Engaged from two weeks before flight with what is inexplicably called customer support and still had to pay again at the last minute to get a flight back to Nairobi. Total loss considerably more than the original return flight total. Sent at least 8 messages to customer support. Initial replies reassuring and seemed to offer resolution but nothing happened. Reassurances turned out to be misleading and the information I needed was never offered. Customer service agents while courteous and polite seem to assume that customers will have an understanding of the rules and practices of the dystopian KA universe. No useful information is provided. It also appears that agents do not have the authority to actually resolve anything. Therefore they do not really engage with an issue but dole out meaningless bland reassurances. To get a flight it required a very long and expensive phone call with an agent who had to constantly refer to a supervisor. Thankfully there are alternatives to KA both externally and internally.
SINSEZSIN. Used Air Seychelles as it was the most direct flight since travelling with 2 young children but now I wished I had travelled via the middle east. Air Seychelles staff arrogant and unfriendly. Asked for food for kids to no avail. Had to get up and fetch it myself. They had loud conversations with their coworkers across the aisle while serving food. Upon arrival to SEZ airport my youngest was sleeping on my shoulder and needed help with hand luggage while going down the stairs to the tarmac. Instead of helping they stood there and watch me like I was their circus act for the night. Thanks to a fellow passenger who came to my rescue The Air Seychelles cabin crew really has a chip on their shoulder. Didnt look like they were very happy to be doing what they were doing.
Osaka to Singapore. There is no hot drink served When we received our meal we asked for hot drink but they told us it will come later. It never came. We have not finished the meal but they have already started serving ice cream. I couldnt finish my meal in time and my tea never came at all. It seems like everything is in a rush. My cold drink not finished yet and the whole tray was collected. The standard has dropped drastically over the years. I choose SQ because I am Singaporean. There are other airline much better than SQ.
Toronto to London sleeper service means you can have a buffet dinner in the lounge rather than onboard the plane to maximise rest time. Excellent flight LHR fast track system allowed for speedy connection onto my flight to Berlin. Heathrow to Berlin a pleasant flight with excellent service. The negative issue is that British Airways business class seat selection costs extra if done in advance.
We have just flown into Nairobi from Harare and going on to Amsterdam and Heathrow. Things started badly the flight was delayed for an hour and a half no explanation or apology offered. On board we then noticed there was no in flight entertainment on offer. Neither of us had flown long distance before on a plane without in flight entertainment. There were no blankets on offer either. It can get pretty cool on these flights. The food was a joke. Something like a mini pasty with quite a nasty taste and possibly even worse a savoury muffin Were only half way through this flight in Nairobi. Were now waiting for 8 hours overnight. The restaurant were in is quite possibly the saddest looking place Ive ever drunk a coffee in. Unloved doesnt begin to describe it. Anyway were wondering now can this possibly get any worse. There are certain words which are applicable here but this will not be published if I include them but Im sure you can guess what they are. Whats really alarming is looking back at reviews from 11years ago making exactly the same criticisms.
Worst flight experience which includes boarding airport service etc. Even if you have to pay extra dollars please prefer to use any other airlines. Never had this flight experience anywhere before. Poor customer care grumpy hostess unhygienic food. They dont care about passengers.
I went to Pakistan and there were lockdown and I spent 2300 to come back on different air line. Oman air didnt refund my return my half ticket no one reply on any platform or phone call. They dont know what to do very disoriented with Oman air. Our agent said Oman air not replying his email I rang and email them with my ticket as well never get any answer from Oman air. I will never use Oman air again until they resolve my half ticket issue and I paid 2300 on top to get back home in uk
Finnair lost my bag and I didnt get them until 5 days later. They didnt tell me about their reimbursement policy and when I tried to provide receipts for reimbursement the requests were denied. For ruining my 50th birthday to Finland where I had had no warm clothing to venture outside of paid activities I was given a small reimbursement to be used on their plane. The trip home was so delayed while waiting for a tour group that I had to beg my way through London and was the last person on the flight. The were literally closing the gate on me and didnt want me to board. It was my first experience with Finnair and the worst experience on any airline I have ever had. They just dont care that they have negative impacts on people. I paid a lot for my trip in October and just received my gift card for use on their airline today. Not only was time wasted in trying to get justice for the problems and additional expenses they caused but there was never an apology or any real compensation for their negligence and poor customer service.
Seoul to Bangkok. This was the worst travel experience Ive had. I was planning to go to BKK. I flew Delta with the intention of transferring to Jeju to complete the trip to BKK. I paid for a ticket the day before and thought everything was fine until I landed in Korea. They tried calling me en route there 23hr flight couldnt answer then sent me an email on the day I landed saying my ticket was cancelled due to technical issues. As I was boarding they denied me my initial flight then said I had to pay another 500 in order to go. I only had a certain amount of money budgeted to make BKK a great experience. I had to use that money to get to BKK. They said they would give me a full refund but that money wouldnt show up in my account until a week later. I love to give everybody the benefit of the doubt but long story short Jeju Airlines completely screwed me over because of their incompetence and technical issues. I wouldnt suggest anyone fly with this airline. My worst travel experience to date and I travel a lot.
New York JFK to Keflavik on 21st January. I was supposed to land in Iceland at 6am after a flight from NYC but due to the weather we were stuck inside a plane for over 10 hours upon arrival. No food or water were provided and no updates available. After 16 hours of being on the plane we were able to get out no apologies or explanations were provided. I tried to reach out to the airline for a refund or compensation of some sort but have not received a response after 2 months. My return flight to NYC was a similar horrific experience when a flight got delayed and overbooked which caused me to miss my connecting flight upon arrival. Yet again no explanation was provided except a smirky comment from the flight attendants that at least we made it to NY. Would not recommend to anyone.
BA2590 20 Aug LGW TO BRI. We checked in online so only had to drop baggage and clear security. Wrong what a chaotic system BA were running. Everyone who checked in online had to wait in a very long line to simply have their bags tagged and sent on their way by a member of BA staff. If this is the case then please get all the counters working and clear the queue quickly. Pity the poor people who squeezed their way to the self check in and bag tagged their bags only to be told to join the same line. I can not understand how the system is supposed to be more efficient. We then had the situation of BA staff dragging people out of the line as they were going to miss their flight. Even the very nice BA staff member who did our bag tags could not explain what went wrong. Flight was delayed on boarding due to flight coming in late. No issue with boarding or the staff on board all very helpful. We have a drink and wrap which was very good. Captain kept us informed of the delay and we landed 30 mins late and he did apologise again for late arrival. Please Gatwick BA sort out check in.
London Heathrow to Hong Kong on time service good seat comfortable and up to date. Food very good. Staff all friendly including on the ground and flight was easy. Perhaps IFE could be a little bit wider in selection but otherwise very good and worthy of 5 status. HKG to LHR also on time. We had been rebooked onto this flight after missing our connection from dragonair due to bad weatherusual chinese airspace problems in shanghai Cathay rebooked us with good seats gave us a hotel in hong kong which was nice and comfortable and made things as easy as possible including giving our baggage business class priority otherwise flight was as above. Would recommend Cathay Pacific to anyone very good and gets 5 from me. Much better than BA on this route.
On time great plane almost new and the crew was fantastic. Good value for service. The only glitch that they keep making is the departure on remote stand and passengers being locked for 10 minutes on the bus
Melbourne to Auckland. This was my second trip on this route with the same airline and the biggest difference was the service from the Cabin Crew. The morning started with a visit to the Emirates Lounge an excellent decision. Boarding once again was chaotic no specific lines indicating Economy Business or First. No one knew where to go and the Ground Team just did nothing to put order in place. When we were airborne the onboard service started and I immediately felt the FAs were not as personal compared to my previous experience. The all seem too busy with getting the job done rather than taking the time to engage with passengers. Food and beverages were average though the portions can definitely increase in size. The seat was comfortable and with blankets and pillows distributed to all passengers. On a good note the IFE was fantastic as the amount of content can keep you entertain for hours. Overall customer satisfaction really needs to be evaluated.
Good service flying from London to Madrid attentive crew and acceptable breakfast on outbound leg and meal on return leg. Outbound leg the crew were pleasant and efficient. On the return leg the crew were one of the most attentive and approachable I have met on a BA flight in quite some time. Food for a shorthaul flight was very good and drinks including champagne regularly offered. The only gripe I have is that unless you are a One World Emerald card holder you cant select your seat at the time of booking unless you pay 22 per person per sector. I think its a British Airways thing. Even the LCCs let you book your seat for a reasonable cost. Paying business class prices I expect to get seat selection as a standard regardless of my status. I think this policy is misguided and I will take this into consideration in booking future flights.
Highly recommended Flew Qatar Airways Stockholm to Bangkok in Business via Doha a few days ago. Been completely comfortable and satisfied with Qatar Airways before and find no reason to change my opinion now. Outstanding service level pleasant and attendant staff superb onboard catering. Their Qsuite is a spectacular experience especially the privacy with the closing door. Any opportunity to fly with Qatar Airways again will be taken most seriously.
We took 3 flights with Aegean and would not recommend them to anyone. Had 3 issues 1. They overbooked our flight and bumped many people. We bought our flight 3 months ahead but checked in about 18 hours before our flight they allow checkin up to 24 hours ahead. We were issued a standby ticket without any seats. When we got to the gate we were told we may or may not get onto the flight and if we didnt then we would have to wait 4 hours for the late night flight or try again in the morning. Lots of other people in the same situation. We were never issued boarding passes but we kept following up with the person at the ticket counter until they gave us passes it seems like due to our persistence and nothing systematic. Luckily we got on that flight but others didnt. Nowhere in the policy does it say that whether or not you get on the flight is related to your checkin time. If you take Aegean check in right away and be persistent about asking for seats 2. They apply a checked bag policy at will. We were sitting near the gate. The gate attendants approached us and asked to weigh our bags. Our bags which fit easily into any overhead bin including previous Aegean flights were found to be slightly overweight apparently 9kgs are allowed ours were about 10kgs. We asked if we could move 1kg into our purse backpack. They said no they need to check the two bags and by the way they are charging us 40Euro per bag. This was for a 45 min flight from an island to Athens. We had no choice and were forced to pay. Also there was no consistency in the way this rule was applied. We saw plenty of other people with carryons larger than ours allowed on the plane and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. 3. Every flight we were on was late. Two of three were late by over 45 mins. We didnt have any connections but I imagine many connecting flights were missed. And this didnt happen to us but its worth noting that when we landed in Athens there were about 30 people waiting at the lost baggage desk. Most of them looked very angry. I asked one person what happened and apparently an entire flight did not have their bags transferred at a connection. So not only will they force you to check your carryon and then pay for a checked bag they might lose it too. Allinall this is a pretty bad track record for 3 short island hop flights.
Bali Denpasar to Seoul Incheon. Checkin was fast and easy by Koreans contracted ground handlers in Denpasar. The flight boarded and pushed back ontime. While the flight overall was fairly comfortable good seat pitch good seatback inflight entertainment pillow blanket provided Koreans cabin crew are very cold and without any personality. They are very robotic in everything they do. The cabin crew was very unfriendly and disingenuous while attending to the passengers forced halfsmiles when serving the meal and drink service the breakfast served was soggy and virtually inedible. This is such a shame because they are dressed to impress and fly onboard such nice airplanes. If only they provided warm caring hospitality they would truly be an outstanding airline. Until then I would not fly on them again by choice.
I finished one movie and I was still waiting for food. Why do you have to separate drink service from meal service and they only serve one full meal on a 7 hour flight. Hype with good hospitality but saving cost on food. Movie selection was terrible and very few choices if you are not Japanese. If you fly frequently like two to four times a month on you second flight youd run out of things to watch.
BA cancelled my flight home the last flight of the day into Heathrow and tried to push me onto another flight to London City 3 hours later My car was at Heathrow. I didnt want to try and cross London late at night on public transport with luggage especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time. I had to book a flight home with Lufthansa which cost 500 for an economy seat but at least it got me home to Heathrow all be it another terminal on the Friday night so I could get home to family. I still have had no news on a refund of the 500 2 months on. Its such a shame flying BA used to be such a pleasurable experience. BA have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey weve booked this year. We are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service.
Nice cabin crew poor food offering. Arms on seats broken. No entertainment screens or radio available. Spent nearly 3000 on holiday and felt like we were given the cheapest flight going. Also window was in a stupid position couldnt look out of it unless you leaned forward. Seat belt buckles full of grime terrible considering the Covid situation.
London to Mumbai flight was excellent. Dreamliner flight. The staff the cabin crew were good. But I feel the flight from Mumbai to Chennai was not up to the mark. Not faced any issue but I feel its not as standardised as the international London to Mumbai flight. The food was amazing and overall I love Vistara more than BA.
Surabaya to Jayapura via Makassar. Flight left Surabaya one hour late nothing unusual for Lion Air. Transfer in Makassar went smoothly and we arrived in Jayapura just that one hour late. Apart from the delay it was a smooth flight typical nofrills Lion style.
A flag carrier that serves one portion of food from Helsinki to New York on a more than 8hour flight...with only water and blueberry juice and coffee. Breakfast Whatever you buy if you like cheese. Because thats the breakfast option that is not included in your ticket. Flight crew numbers have been reduced so restrooms will sure become pretty interesting after the fifth hour. Even crew itself feels it 8hr flight you have a chance to talk with them. But talking about the crew they are trying their best no issues with the professionalism Finnair decisionmakers on the other hand turned the airline into the first flag carrier lowcost airline for nonlowcost prices. Avoid it on longdistance definitely.
Horrifying one way to describe it. No airline has ever given me trouble trying to check in. But when they checked me in it was like they were trying to find a reason I cant come to Korea even with the KETA form already done and accepted. It annoyed me with the QCODE which is not necessary you still sign a form when you arrive its just annoying so its better to have one. I am so shocked they charge for everything. Want a blanket pay for it even though you cant keep it. It was cold on the plane. I have never been on a plane that was cold. They let someone next to not wear his mask really amazing. They dont really care you have your feet on someones chair when you are landing or you release your seatbelt when the flight has just landed. Positive that customers can do sort of what they want.
I am one of the unlucky souls who booked a flight with United in late June 2023. I had to end my vacation in the Caribbean to return to Canada for a family emergency. What was supposed to be an 9h trip turned into a four day nightmare that cost me upwards of 2800 USD in out of pocket expenses in addition to the original ticket price. I was shocked to find some United employees incredibly lacking in empathy and extremely aggressive. On day three of the ordeal a customer service rep at Newark took a cursory look at my booking claimed I was rebooked on an air Canada flight and was no longer a United passenger. I told her the booking was not complete and Air Canada had explained after I had gone back and forth between the two long queues that United had not actually booked me it was more of a temporary hold. The United staff refused to even speak to me even as I begged tears streaming down my face explaining I had a family emergency. A manager then aggressively threatened to call security if I didnt step aside because I had already used up 30 minutes of their time which she knew was a blatant lie. I then had to go back to Air Canada and then called United on the phone all of which was useless. I finally booked myself on a new ticket via the United app travelled to another terminal C and waited for 8 hours only to have that trip cancelled as well. I was now approaching day 4 so feeling utterly defeated I booked myself a business class ticket home from Newark with Air Canada. It cost me 2300 USD and was a red eye with a long layover in Quebec City but that flight DID make it and Im now home. I think United deserves to be sued for its failure to support and look after the wellbeing of its customers. Shame on them and on lawmakers who allow this level of negligence and disregard for passengers wellbeing see reports of the atrocious conditions in some terminals especially Newark terminal C. I will never travel with United or through the US again for that matter.
We had a trip with 4 flights included. All 4 flights were delayed. The worst with 2h15min. Also one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a 4h earlier flight loosing 4h of our short vacation. No explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays. I expected a lot better as I have earlier used BA with good results. This was a really bad experience and I will avoid using BA for any further travels.
Have flown many times with Blue1 and cabin crew very helpful and friendly. The planes are good standard with good leg room. In addition the checkin routines are fast and efficient no matter how you do it.
One way Jetairfly flight from Antwerp to Berlin Tegel. 50 minute delay was only announced at the planned time of departure. Nearly new aircraft the largest that is able to fly on Antwerps runway thin seats but ok for short holiday flights. Very quiet and clean. Friendly professional cabin crew excellent service. Prices of onboard food and drinks are for airline service reasonable. This airline often has very good deals available even on short notice. Very reasonable price but the available fares vary a lot. Flight was about 7080 full so they dont seem to be doing too bad. The airline tries to be something in between a fullservice carrier a charter operator and a lowcost operator.
The most useless business class I have seen on the regional routes. Gold track doesnt work at all in the airport seats are the same not even like in euro business class when the one in the middle is not occupied I had to queue four lines on my way to the plane and not even once I could skip any of it I was just waiting like everyone else. No welcome drinks on the board poor lounge in the Cairo Domestic terminal.
Sydney to Athens via Dubai. Emirates is an overpriced airline with too much marketing budget and no substance one that I would advise others to never fly on unless they have no other options. The flight was bad but not funny or interesting experience bad just depressing and frustrating and not worth the money you pay for it. My food wasnt served until 6 hours into the flight on my side of the aisle the other side got served an hour or two earlier attendants did not respond to the call button and when they did serve you they did not speak smile or even respond with a yes or no when asked to bring water. Which was strange considering that had two shifts on board so there was a lot of attendants wandering around but none of them seemed to be working. The attendants ended up being more of a nuisance than service because there were so many of them they used the passengers overhead bins in my area 45 bins about 5 rows both sides for their items and passengers were left with no space. In an attempt to hire as many nationalities as possible the crew had no cohesion or chemistry they split off into sub groups based on nationalitylanguage and spent most of the flight gossiping and chatting with their friends. There was audible laughter when the screen popped up with a what did you think of this flight followed by several terrible from the rows in front and behind us. The inflight entertainment system was dated and old movies not modern and recent and the Business Class lounge experience during the transfer in Dubai was atrocious and left a lot to be desired again on the service side of things. These are minor issues but the flight was so terrible that these other issues are amplified and made worse. If youre considering Emirates look at the reviews on this website they have a 610 rating which is lower than most other airlines.
Bangkok to Hong Kong. Pricing is the reason for round trips. I arrived at the airport kiosk no queue. The hostess welcome was okay. Boarding time is 08.25 am. They were on time. but waiting so long to take off. Onboard the seat was clean. but I want to change to long legroom. The hostess said I need to pay an extra charge so I dont change. Seat big enough. They have a TV. The quality of the food was not too bad. Id fly them again.
Beirut to New York via Paris. The food was disappointing. We took a long flight and the least that they can do is provide a decent meal for the people that are paying this much to fly with them. To be honest i wouldnt fly with them again.
Disappointed and would not recommend if you have a connecting flight. They will board the plane and make everyone wait until they fill in more seats before the plane is willing to take off. Held up the plane 30 minutes waiting for more passengers to be added resulting in unnecessary delays. Then sat on tarmac another 15 minutes. So inconsiderate for the passengers who count on the plane leaving on time.
We had excellent flights on Meridiana as we traveled from JFK to Naples and back. The plane appeared to be fairly new and the cabin clean. I might also add that the departure flight and the return both arrived ahead of schedule. There were 6 flight attendants on the return flight to JFK including 4 stewards and 2 stewardesses. They were particularly attentive and the food they served was excellent. Beverages flowed throughout most of the trip and that included complimentary wine. We flew Economy class and had no issues at all. If you are considering a flight with Meridiana do not hesitate they exceeded our expectations.
Perth to Trivandrum via Kuala Lumpur. Worst flight and baggage dealing. I lost my baggage while I was flying from Perth on 31 Jan 2020. No Response from Malindo Air. I register a complaint at Trivandrum Airport. But no Response. I didnt get my baggage today.
Three times they made the same mistake and didnt confirm our seats on our Delta flights before our international ones. Had to spend part of my time on my vacation on hold and dealing with them to make sure it doesnt happen on the way back and it still did. And they just said there was nothing they could do. The stress is not worth booking through this airline.
I flew on flight TS932 from Toronto to Vancouver in August 2021 and the flight attendants were rude and unsafe. The flight was packed and half the flight was not wearing masks. The flight attendants made no effort at all to ask people to put their masks on I felt very unsafe. One of the flight attendants stopped to have a conversation with the couple beside me in French. They complained about how rude and unfriendly people from Ontario are they said people from Ontario are lazy for not learning French the flight attendant agreed and said that our accents are so terrible when we speak French that we shouldnt even try. After that conversation the flight attendant gave the couple beside me free wine and beer. I found that entire conversation to be extremely insulting and ignorant they assumed that no one on the flight could speak French simply because we were flying out of Toronto. On top of all of this the man in front of me reclined his seat fully and was basically laying in my lap the entire flight Im not sure why they built the chairs like that but it is not covid safe.
This flight was operated by Tigerair Taiwan and redeye flight was 80 full. Food is unique all is Taiwanese local delight but portion was too small. Seat was almost same with other LCC like Jetstar Asia Vanilla Air etc.
Reykjavik to San Francisco. Worst airlines I have taken in my life. Zero customer service and very rude staff. They have no consideration for the customers they treat them like trash andor second class citizens
Very bad service on board. You feel you are in market not a flight all during the flight selling product. Just to test them i asked for a tap glass of water they refuse that and ask me to pay 2 for small bottle.
I sat down and waited for about 45 minutes until the crew announced they are starting to board the aircraft. Oh boy I said to myself and the journey of your life is beginning I thought to myself. I must have been judging it before I even boarded the plane which by the way had one of the cleanest salons I have ever seen. But their professional level service and quality shocked me since it was so much better of what anyone would have expected from a top airline. I mean a small Airline company of a small Eastern European country has reserved a spot in my top 5 air travel experiences. I wanted to make sure that I wasnt focusing on myself and was evaluating my opinions based on what I have been seeing around me. The crew didnt seem make a difference between passengers. Everyone seemed to be equally important whether they were French Azeri English American or Russian. I asked their hostesses for a bottle of water and some wine several times and I would get the same answer Of course When they were serving food I wasnt sure what they were serving. The hostess gave me a natural smile and showed me the samples of servings and explained what was in them. In major airlines that I have flown the crew would be as robotic as a person can get totally dehumanized. I felt culture in that although watching an original Hollywood movie with Turkish subtitles felt kind of odd. They must have understood one of them if not both. I know from my experience with airlines that no matter how big they get the only way to judge them stays the same Quality of service including security and assistance is what counts.
The flight to Paris was mostly ok except it was delayed for about 45 minutes while police came to remove an unruly drunk passenger. However the return flight was by far the worst experience weve ever had with an airline. We had purchased extra leg room on the bulk head and upon getting to the seats there was a large service dog that took up the space in front of my wifes seat and even part of the space in front of my seat. Not just the extended leg room portion which we purchased but alk her leg room see picture. French bee should have a policy that if a service animal is over a certain size the passenger must purchase two seats. I essentially paid for this guys extra space for his service dog Again my wife had to move to a seat without extra leg room. When we pointed out the problem to the flight crew although at least 3 different members came over to look at the situation and all did the hmmm I see the problem thing none of them did anything about it. My wife eventually just moved to an open seat on her own. When we asked for a refund on the difference in price between the extra leg room and economy seat an extremely reasonable request we received the following response First and foremost we regret the inconveniences you had to face as regard your flight BF720 on 04302023. Service animals are trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a qualified individual with a disability including a physical sensory psychiatric intellectual or other mental disability. Therefore passenger seated next to you was allowed to have his dog outside a cage. In this instance we must respectfully deny your request. Needless to say we will not by flying with French Bee again. Buyer beware.
Amazing customer service review delayed due to ill health. In May I was flown by Royal Flying Doctor Service to Adelaide where I spent 6 days due to a sudden acute illness and after which I flew with your airline to Broken Hill where we had left our caravan so we could return to our home in Sydney for further medical care. Among the passengers on the flight were an elderly frail woman and a woman returning to her regional home after shoulder surgery I was feeling pretty fragile myself. We were all at the front of the plane and my husband and I were really impressed with the flight attendant Abby for whom nothing seemed too much trouble and who was very mindful of the particular issues the elderly lady and the postsurgery lady both travelling alone faced. Abby had a delightful demeanour and the service she provided was both efficient and compassionate. We were very impressed overall.
VKOAER. Overall pleasantly surprised by the product. Online checkin via Aeroflots website was quick and efficient. Vnukovo airport is clean spacious and comfortable with lots of Rossiyas checkin counters and assistance desks. The aircraft was new and clean although legroom was a bit tight seats themselves were very comfortable. Cabin crew were quick efficient and friendly. Free food included a nice sandwich tea coffee juices and Coke. You could also purchase a nice craft beer with snacks. Overall a very pleasant experience for a middle discountsector airline.
In September October 2016 I flew with my wife around the world using in sequence Virgin Atlantic Air NZ and Singapore Airlines. All in Premium Economy. The principal airline booked was Air NZ and their service in Premium Economy was excellent. Unfortunately our flights from Auckland to London via Singapore were very poor. The standard of Singapore Airlines Premium Economy was inferior to Air NZ and to a lesser extent Virgin Atlantic. Singapore Airlines Premium Economy is marginally superior to Economy class and vastly inferior to their Business Class. During the first hour of my flight from Singapore to London I made my concerns known to the senior cabin steward. He made a mental note but did nothing to show any reparation for the poor service except that he admonished his junior staff for serving wine in clear plastic beakers as opposed to the glass beakers provided alongside the plastic foiltopped water on the food tray. He explained that Singapore Airlines were relatively new to offering Premium Economy class. No welcoming drink no menu in seating area alcoholic beverages served in plastic cups meals of appallingly poor standard coffee disgustingly bitter wines of a poor standard. Apparently champagne was available but it was not offered to passengers and I only became aware of it after a chance conversation with cabin staff while waiting to use the bathroom. Singapore Airlines offers very little in terms of Premium service in its Premium Economy cabin service.
Ho Chi Minh to Amsterdam via Moscow. We paid 100 euro more to select seats with this I hoped that I would be able to book the extra leg space I would not even mind to pay again a bit extra this was not possible we called with the airline and asked if they could book them for us. This was not possible we should do this at the airport 24 hours before check in we went to the airport to arrange this this was not possible we should do this in Moskou. There we had 1.5 hour transfer time. Next day we checked in and we will fix the extra leg space in Moskou when we arrived in Moskou we had to wait in a line because of a delay we had 45 minutes transfer time. At the transfer desk we tried to get the extra legspace. During the flight there were many rows with the extra legspace free. I was not allowed to change seats. For the way back we managed it differently we went again 24 hours before to the airport... no aeroflot desk.. For this flight back we managed it. With good mood at the gate the new hell starts .. 1 hour delay because of cleaning the plane and we had again 1.5 hours to transfer arrived Moscow 35 mins late. hour long flight in stress because of the staff who can only say you go to transfer desk.
We usually regularly fly direct flight with Emirates Airlines very well known for its comfort and impeccable customer service however due to availability of flights my daughter along with her toddler decided to travel a roundtrip to DXBMNLDXB via PAL for the first time since the pandemic. I am a 74 year old senior and a post stroke patient with slight immobility on my left half which require assistance. Our trip from Dubai to Philippines was ok but the trip back to Dubai from Manila was very frustrating which started off very badly at how our checkin was handled by the staff on the ground. We had to literally beg for assistance and consideration at the staff at the checkin counter. The customer service at the checkin desk is shockingly unhelpful and inconsiderate. To think that our traveling party consisted of a person with disability myself a toddler and one abledperson my daughter to take care of us at checkin etc. And with luggage. So imagine how challenging our situation is. It is very unfortunate as we rarely use PAL for traveling and when we did we had to encounter such level of service from the staff on the ground at the check in counter. I would have thought that given the set back the airlines face this pandemic theyd take excellent care of their customers well but this was not the case with PAL sadly quite the opposite. We would never experience such treatment with Emirates Airlines.
Not my first time using EVA Air but first time for about 5 years checkin a bit slow as was security and passport control. Once airside used the EVA Air lounge through my FF status the lounge is okay not great but quiet with okay food offering. Boarding was slow although polite once on board arrived at my seat 26A which I always like on this aircraft. Drinks served before departure which was around an hour late once in the air the crew provided a good service. The seat was pretty comfortable and luckily I had the adjacent seat empty lunch and dinner served during the flight with drinks and snacks offered frequently. Im a big fan of Premium Economy and EVA Air do it well more PTV options might be nice however I slept 6 hours so okay. Arrived on time after 12 hours 20 minutes bags off quickly great service I did notice though that EVA Air have installed 343 in economy so I wont be flying economy on EVA but otherwise would use EVA anytime in PE.
A nightmare journey to Amritsar due to leave at 1350 from BHX. On arriving for check in we were informed the flight was delayed 11 hours spent all day at the airport. On boarding the flight the staff were rude and unhelpful not even fully conversant in English. The flight was due to land in Ashgabad for a short break but the pilot took the aircraft to Mary Airport due to bad weather and left the aircraft as did other members of crew. The passengers were left sitting on the aeroplane for 4 hours prior to it taking off for Amritsar. There were insufficient drinks onboard and we were not able to leave the aircraft. Staff could not update us on when we would leave Mary as they had to wait for another aeroplane to land so they could get back up to full crew. I will never fly with these people again they offered no apologies for the gross mistreatment of the passengers. Never will my family travel with Turkmenistan Airlines again
The flight was operated by Smart Wings and it was a surprisingly good experience. I have not flown Czech Airlines for many years and now after booking the flight and after reading the reviews I got really scared. But it was a very pleasant surprise. I booked the economy flex ticket so I got a little ciabatta water coffee and a biscuit. Additionally I bought a beer on board some 25 EUR. I got an emergency exit seat which was another nice suprise. The flight was on time the crew very professional and friendly water offered to everyone several times during the flight checked if anyone needs anything. Overall a very good experience. After flying for many years only with Lufthansa group I would not say that Czech Airlines are worse. Even on the way to St. Petersburg my experience was pretty much the same. The only difference was that I did not get the emergency exit seats and I have to say that the legroom in the normal seats is very limited.
A pleasant surprise on this MURTNR flight in a 340. Comfortable seats for a 2 hours flight but in no way a lie flat nice staff proper food and wine. Much better than my previous flight NAIMUR where I paid business fare to be seated on a coach seat and the crew told me it has not changed this is why I would not recommend this airline.
Worst airline I have ever used. They treat us like we are flying for free. Staff here is very rude to customers and things are not even organised a bit around here. This was totally disappointing and i will never travel Air Arabia again.
Paris Orly to New York JFK. I was lucky to travel between two strikes. Beside that check in was very smooth security fast. Orly west Air France lounge is ok not a great selection of food but alcohol as much as you want. No shower. Easy boarding sky priority respected. Configuration is 121. The seat is very comfortable. As soon as you board we were welcomed by the senior stewardess with a choice of champagne orange juice or water. The plane left on time. Food was quite good even if the chicken was over cooked and dry. One thing which is weird they serve the cheese at the same time the appetizer. Very good entertainment system. Good choice of movies. The thing which is to consider they serve the prearrival snack only if you request it so if you dont read properly the menu you dont get it. Arrived in JFK ahead of schedule. Overhaul a very good experience.
Mumbai to Singapore a mediocre experience. Vistara doesnt have early bag drop in Mumbai. When I landed in Singapore I found that two wheels of my suitcase were damaged. Vistaras rep said that wear and tear would not be compensated which I accepted. The repair man I took it to noticed a large gash on body and said I should replace the bag. On both sectors my food quality and quantity were lacking. Outbound sector was an overnight flight at 0145hrs Breakfast comprised of an omelette chicken sausage and something else. Return lunch was a bowl of curry with chicken vegetable and rice. A salad started the meal and a small rasmalai for dessert. Lie flat seats in a 2x2 layout in the narrow body aircraft with little privacy. Theres not much time to sleep so its not a major issue. I wasnt impressed by the crew on the outgoing flight perhaps because of the time of day. I felt that they were trying to rush things but the return flight was considerably better. Internet on board voucher given did not work.
The aircraft was changed at the last minute to an ancient one with a seating configuration of 222 instead of 121 QSuites. Offering that kind of configuration for the same price as a QSuite is just robbery. Anyway the crew was great and always willing to help. On the catering side despite the flight leaving at 2am Qatar should in my opinion have a couple of full meals available for passenger who do not want to sleep right away. The only options were soup or salad or cheese. Given the age of the aircraft the air was very dry and I could barely sleep. In the future I will avoid their ancient 777 at any cost
Will never fly Jetstar again. Attendant randomly selected my partner and I to weigh our carry ons. They were slightly more then 7kg so we were charged some and had to check the bags. No one else was asked to weigh their carry ons. Virtually everyone had bags of similar size and Im sure many were more than 7kg. Wonderful way to put a bad taste in your customers mouths. Once again I wont fly Jetstar again.
Manila to Hong Kong return B777 and A330 was operated by Cathay Pacific Airways while the Hong Kong to Cengdu A330 A320 was operated by Cathay Dragon. The seat legroom and width on B777 and A330 are ample while on the A320 33 configuration is quite squeezed. The HKGMNL flight is 343 configuration but at the back where 78A is located has 242 configuration. 78A might be the last choice for most people but I highly recommend it as it has more space compared to other seats in the economy section. Since the MNLHKGMNL is just a short flight onyl refreshments was served. Coffee is available upon request. For the HKGCTUHKG breakfast is served. The food is good. Storage for coats or jacket is also available and the FAs are willing to assist. IFE selection is enough for a short flight. The flying time is not enough actually to finish one movie. The toilet are clean and are wellmaintained throughout the duration of the flight. Both ground staff and inflight staff are courteuous helpful and friendly.
If and a big if everything goes smoothly then it is a good airline to travel with but if you encounter any problems whether its at the airport regarding ticketing or lost luggage then you are out of luck. The airline lost both of my suitcases in Istanbul not sure if they were misplaced or put on the wrong flight but anyhow when both of my suitcases were lost then obviously they were misplaced and not stolen. The uphill battle started trying to find a Turkish airline representative at Istanbul airport to report the issue and could not find anyone. For people who have been to Istanbul airport I am sure you know that no one speaks English or any other language besides Turkish so good luck communicating with anyone at the airport. Finally an hour later got to the office of lost and found at the airport and reported the luggage loss. The process was difficult not professional they have no clue what is customer service extremely hard to communicate with and top of all they do not care about your concerns. It has been 2 weeks since they lost my two suitcases in Istanbul I had to buy cloth toiletry etc. for my stay in Istanbul and now I am back in Houston without my suitcases. Calling them they refer you to the website to write feedback big deal and then you never get a response from anyone. Neither a compensation for my loss. Pay a little more with other airlines and for sure you will get a better service.
On the fourth of July 2023 I took the last flight that day around 23.00 to Frankfurt from Ho Chi Minh with Vietnam Airlines. VN31. After going through the security check I realized that my jacket was still hanging on the other side even before the custom check. I asked one of the security men what to do. He advised me to go to the gate and talk there with somebody of the Staff of Vietnam Airlines. After waiting there for a while a man arrived who took care of two older people in wheelchairs. I explained him the situation and asked him for help. Without further ado he took action and walked back with me to the security check. There he asked me to wait went trough the security check found my jacket within one minute and brought it back to me. Needles to say that made me very happy. I want to express my sincere gratitude to this man of whom I dont know the name. He showed me what real service means and did a good job for Vietnam Airlines. So in the future I will fly again with Vietnam Airlines also because of this show of great service.
Other than a low price I do not find many redeeming qualities. The aircraft were new but the layout appeared a bit uncoordinated as did the design and color schemes. Service was very green and awkward. I found the food was very mediocre rather institutional. IFE was lacking in selection. The seats were good and the flight was on time. This carrier does an okay job if it serves your low fare needs.
Sydney to Madrid return via Hong Kong. This was my fourth journey to Europe on Cathay Pacific in Premium Economy in the last two years. While seat comfort and IFE remain excellent cabin service and food quality have declined noticeably. Meals used to be a notch below Business Class now they are basically standard Economy Class I compared as I walked through the Economy section. Cabin crew serve Premium Economy food and then continue into Economy and eventually return to collect trays. They are rarely seen between meal times. Service and food standards are now virtually the same as Economy but the fare is marked up 200300 a big difference for about 40 more space. You also have to walk back through Economy and compete for lavatories. Cathay Pacific Premium Economy is not good value any more and unlikely to remain on my shopping list. This is disappointing for an otherwise excellent airline.
After cancelling one of my connecting flights on my return journey Etihad refused to rebook me on another flight. They said the only option was a refund which I begrudgingly accepted because there was no other option. I had to spend money out of my own pocket to rebook with another airline at a much higher price because it was short notice. I have waited nearly 3 months and I have still not received a refund. Every time I contact the team either on web chat or phone they just keep stalling they keep telling me they have to email the refunds team which will take another 5 working days and there is no chance for me to contact them directly. This is beginning to seem like the behaviour of scam artists.
DMKDPS. Thai Air Asia has a daily direct flight between Bangkok and Bali at good time leave at 615 AM and arrives at 1130 AM so our flight is full with tourists mostly backpackers and families many of them has little to no traveling experience so starting from boarding was a challenge since many of them didnt know that we are boarding based on zones. On board the FAs were very polite and patient when handling these passengers and making sure they know the basic rules of flying like how to stow their luggage properly. This was a full flight so it takes time to get everything taken care of and we left around 30 minutes behind schedule but we arrived only around 10 minutes late. Flight time is almost 4 hours so the FAs have ample time to hand out preordered food and beverages. We ordered two items each and they all come with drinks and the FAs were so kind to hand our orders two at a time and came back to give us our second order around 1.5 hours before we land. The FAs on this flight were also wearing their masks all the time as was with other Thai Air Asia flights but it didnt hide the genuine courtesy and kindness in their service. This is a very good flight and we see that the high service level is similar throughout all Thai Air Asia flights regardless of their flight duration or their flight time.
Special appreciation to the cabin crew Sonika. I was super impressed with her fluency in announcements all three different languages and it was just amazing to hear her out.
Amazing experience new comfortable aircraft professional staff great food and beverages served. Very comfy seats. Convenient transfers in Doha Airport.
JetBlue customer service and system is pathetic. We came to St Thomas on vacation but had a family emergency need to return immediately. I called Jet Blue to inquire about options. It took so long to get a human then she didnt seem to understand the situation then she could only cancel our existing return but couldnt book our new return. We spent 4.5 hours talking to 3 different people and by then there were no flights available for tomorrow. Desperate we tried to book flights for the next day and Jet Blues awful app would not take my paymentUSING a Jet Blue credit card I tried another credit card then another nothing. I was frantic It turns out the app had raised the ticket price while I was putting in my information which I shouldnt have to do. I fly every week and have a rewards membership. I am livid and disgusted by JetBlue. There is no reason not to hire intelligent agentsand plenty of themwho take ownership of a problem and no reason not to empower them to solve problems. If these agents had not taken 4.5 hours to cancel a flight and manually refund points then we would be at my familys bedside. I will never forgive JetBlue and Im cutting up my Jet Blue credit card.
While booking they claimed I could earn miles on American Airlines. When I went to airport on my boarding pass they gave me a boarding pass which clearly indicated that they used my American Frequent Flier number. But when I did not see miles on my American account I contacted American who informed me that Gulf is not their partner. I contacted Gulf many times regarding this and they never replied. Either they are grossly incompetent or complete frauds.
Friendly crew clean cabin flight on time. Aircraft was the newest in fleet 9 years old good communications from the flight deck. Food and drinks ok.
Flew Madrid to London Heathrow. The 767 is ancient and BA have clearly given up on hiding that fact I guess they will be phasing these old but great planes out of service soon. I love flying in 767s the configurations are generally very comfortable but to be honest the plane was really dated and BA should definitely improve this. Aside from this the flight was really very good indeed. BA Business class has in my experience always been consistent consistently good. BA cabin crew in Business class are a real asset. This was one of BAs more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphere. The flight was very busy but the staff were very efficient and the loading on the flight did not prejudice the overall experience. Food was very tasty indeed and there was an excellent selection of drinks. Ill be sad to see the 767s go but the time has come.
I have just returned from a trip to Lagos Nigeria in Economy Class from Heathrow. I can not fault the aeroplane there was lots of leg room and my partner and I are not short at 5ft10 and 6ft2 good entertainment selection and plenty of food and drink throughout the journey. All the staff were welcoming and the plane was clean. My only complaint would be that both food options on the way out were spicy Nigerian dishes but this is only because I am fussy if you like spicy food you will love the selection however on the way back there was a non spicy dish which was lovely. I would not hesitate to fly with Arik again.
My wife and I flew to Dublin from London Heathrow in Business Class on a Avios upgrade with British Airways. We used the lounge in terminal 5 which had a good selection of food and drinks. We were delayed leaving for just over an hour for technical reasons. Salmon salad and a couple of drinks on the hour flight. Good value with an almost free upgrade would not pay the normal price for such a short trip.
I use different airlines very frequently and Emirate is one the worst. It canceled my original flight and change to new one with more than 8 hours gap and they didnt suggest any facility. Also the reason for canceling the first flight is unclear because the first flight was working and no need to change my flight. Their behavior in checkin was very rude. They weight everything even a tiny kid backpack and charged very expensively for even 1 kilo overweight. Finally I never use this unreliable airline.
First of all on the return flight the staff delayed opening the gate then I found my confirmed seat was busy with another passenger so they were changing my seat without talking to another passenger. Second I asked for water 34 times then they provided me with a cup of water not a bottle of water. Its strange to have this in corona time. Third the food was not tasty at all it was very cold. Fourth they announce that the internet is free to use but in reality it needs the passenger to pay money to have it. And hosts not supported any passenger to get free internet. Fifth they start collecting the headset 20 minutes before the flight ending so you couldnt keep watching the movie. Sixth There was a shortage of covers and they were not available on the plane.
The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful with good service and catering unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites.
Rome to Constanta. A slight delay on the second leg of the flight due to bad weather affecting the incoming connection. Food Ok and service fine basically you got what you paid for and no complaints from me would use them again.
Our flight was amazing from start to finish. I always fly Emirates because of the fabulous hospitality. Both legs of the flight were fantastic. A staff member on our second leg of the journey from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur on the 6 Oct EK 0344 gave us special treatment on the flight as it was my daughters 9th birthday. My kids were given a special cake in a lovely glass presentation with Polaroid photos to take home for memories. This staff member is the true face of Emirates service with a smile and amazing hospitality. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts
Alicante to Almaty via Moscow. March 15 2020 checked in received a boarding pass. Before boarding they were taken off the flight and left at Alicante airport explained their actions by the situation with coronovirus. Tickets were bought back a long time ago is it really impossible to somehow manage humanly in this situation. Does the whole world in a difficult situation really need to do this Im standing at the airport opposite the office of this company. They all left the phone. Im calling the offices nobody picks up the phone.
I had a bitter experience of flying with Air Arabia two times they keep on rescheduling and they are not providing stay or food. Moreover there is no feedback tab in their website. Reply from customer call center and reply mail is a nightmare. There is no refund for the cancellation tickets too and I received damaged baggage one time too.
Cancelled my flight automatically put me on another flight 1 day later very difficult to reach customer service to understand why and how to change the flight get my money back. You get what you pay for. Very unreliable cheap poor quality service. Might be worth it if youre on a strict budget and have very flexible dates but even then Im not sure its worth the hassle.
Sao Paulo London Heathrow Club World. Sat in the upper deck on the 747. Fantastic experience. Very comfortable flight with attentive helpful cabin crew. Reasonable food good selection of drinks and good IFE.
Flew them before and despite low cost business class is a joy. I booked economy but on check in I was able to purchase an upgrade for a really small fee which included lounge access and preboarding. Seats are a bit cramped for someone over 1.90 meters but with an empty middle seat not an issue. Service was great staff was very attentive though not fluent in English they cared for their passengers. A really nice warm lunch was provided with beverages. Spanish products are served and I like this pride for their county. Wifi was available for a small fee. Overall a very nice flight 2.15 h and perfectly on time.
I have flown Belavia to Prague several times. Im pretty much satisfied. Organized checkin nice service onboard food is normal not very tasty though. Newer airplanes are better like smaller CRJ some Boeings do look old and they are. Seats are comfortable enough. Captain updates you on fight conditions and timings several times during the flight and its nice. Landings were pretty smooth.
London to Melbourne via Doha. I would just like to thank the lovely staff at Qatar checkin at Heathrow Airport. They were very helpful and fantastic at helping me stay calm at this terrible time and made the checkin process very easy.
We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
I did the check in normally. However the same day of the trip my flight got postponed two days and they didnt tell me. They didnt send an email SMS call nothing. I learned because when I consulted on the webpage the cost of upgrading my seats there I saw that the flight was scheduled for two days after so they did send me an email to upgrade my seat but not for telling me that I had to wait two days to flight. I couldnt call the airline because their client service was not working. The WhatsApp service is absolutely useless. So I wasnt sure if the flight was happening or not and I could talk to no one. Never again.
I made a single reservation with Emirates to fly from Milan to Botswana via Dubai and Johannesburg. The two flights to and from Botswana were operated by other airlines. On my way to Botswana I made a transit in Dubai and a transit in Johannesburg. On my way back things went bad. We arrived at the airport in Botswana Maun and the flight we booked on the Emirates website was not present. We asked and found out that it had been replaced by another flight operated by a different airline at a different time. We checked in for this new flight and found out that no transit was possible in Johannesburg. Therefore we had to go through immigration retrieve our luggage queue again for the check in pass security and passport control to get on our next flight to Dubai. To me its unbelievable that Emirates did not care to inform us about the flight change and the fact that we could not make a normal transit like on the first part of our journey. Its a pity because the flight experience has been good with very nice crew and operating on time.
Flew Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Bangkok. Seat was very comfortable. Legroom was great and cabin crew were very polite as usual. The meal was delicious and it was nice of them to offer ice cream as a dessert. Inflight entertainment was also good but could have more options. Even though we were flying in one of the old A330s this Singapore Airlines experience was amazing. Definitely would try them again.
Paris to Sydney via Hong Kong. We found the staff helpful and considerate. Travelling economy was not much fun as it was cramped and we are old. If we travel again we will try to upgrade. The food was okay and the service good. The toilets were clean and overall we found travelling with Cathay Pacific good.
On September 17 I took an Emirates flight with my family. The flight attendants were wonderful except for their aggressive cabin manager. There is absolutely no maturity. Leaving aside his lack of professionalism in leading his team. He was yelling at his team and we heard him. That doesnt make for a pleasant workplace.
British Airways crew going out from London Heathrow to Calgary were very keen and enthusiastic. They were also very good fun which makes life more pleasant up in the sky. We do this flight every 6 months on our way to visit family in Canada. Food was good but like other reviewers weve noticed little changes which make things not quite so special. For instance the wine is not as pleasant as it used to be and there used to be a choice of 2 types of red or white. One of our fellow passengers said he could have done with a bit more food. So take some snacks with you for the wee small hours. On the return journey the dinner was good but they ran out of beef in premium economy and there were only 6 of us. We were given food from business but it was served on a freezing cold plate and just lacked finesse. I know this is only premium economy but there were good standards a few years back. The breakfast before landing at Heathrow was horrible a bagel with some cream cheese in it and some tooth breaking cereal bars. I must write and complain to BA about their breakfasts and have done so once with no effect. I will try again. The staff were very efficient and we felt safe and there were regular drinks runs but like many others who travel regularly with BA we were a little disappointed and hope that they will be kind enough to listen to their loyal customers of many years.
Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur. I cant wait for my trip back to KUL on Citilink. As per schedule the plane took off fro Juanda International Airport and landed safely at KLIA. The nasi lemak presented to me was delicious. The plane felt new and the cabin crew were attentive. I would certainly like to fly with Citilink again in the near future.
Luton to Alicante 9th September. Due to technical problems with Monarch Airlines plane we boarded a replacement A320 operated for Monarch by Titan Airways. A flight just like they used to be. A professional and articulate purser and other crew members very good too. Most refreshing was that all passengers received a free hot breakfast and beverages served swiftly. The most enjoyable to Alicante I have taken courtesy of Titan Airways.
Absolute nightmare of an airline arrived at Sydney airport at 09.00 for our flight departure at 13.10. Once inside the terminal it was absolute chaos with the queue for Malaysia airlines snaking halfway round the airport terminal people were shoving and pushing to jump the queue and all of this mayhem was being controlled by just one man this gentleman should be awarded a medal for his efforts for stopping a riot Even though we had checked in online the day before we still had to queue for almost 4 hours just to drop our hold bags at the counter eventually we made it to the plane and departed Sydney around 15.00 hrs. The next 24hrs of travel through to Dublin were without a doubt the worst travel experience i have ever endured from inedible food to airline staff who appeared to have just given up Upon arrival in Ireland we then had another lengthy delay as they had lost our luggage six days later we were eventually reunited with our suitcases. I would strongly advise anyone thinking about using this airline to reconsider as they give a strong impression that they are on the way out.
Paris to Kolkata via Doha. Flying with Qatar is a pleasant experience. This time I flew in economy as is quite confortable. Unfortunately there is no premium economy. Movie and music selection is excellent. Seats quite comfortable. The only negative point was the meal on both flights. I ordered a meal for diabetics and the meals that were served were not suitable for diabetics which is very annoying when you have to travel on a long distance. Some cabin staff did not seem to be well trained on the flight to Kolkata the service was quite chaotic.
Muscat to Zurich via Dubai. I love their excellent service on the ground and in the air the best inflight entertainment system excellent crew food and wine on board is superior. I cannot fault them.
Vancouver to Cebu via Incheon with Korean Air. Excellent customer service. Upon checkin in Vancouver I informed the Korean Air staff that my mothers last name was missing a letter. Right away they catered for us and positively informed us that they should be able to fix the mistakes. There were 3 staff helping us out and all of them were super friendly. We were very pleased of the customer service that we recieved from this airline from the checkin counter to the flight attendants. I will recommend this airline to all my friends and relatives.
May 3 flew from Seattle to Heathrow then to Edinburgh. BA lost my golf bag which caused me to purchase golf shoes club rentals tees balls. I had tee times at two courses in St. Andrews that took months to make. The promised my bag returned in 24 hours and they would reimburse occurred expenses. I contacted BA and they state they would only reimburse toiletries. Then the return flight home was randomly canceled by BA without notifying me or without notice two weeks before the scheduled flight. I contacted the corporate travel team they informed me BA canceled my return reservation. They rebooked me on the same flight. BA customer service was horrendous and make false promises. I will never use this airlines again. Beware of British Airways. They also randomly canceled my girlfriend and her fathers flight and they are both gold members.
Not happy with return flight. I bought tickets 6 months ago family of four traveling together and reserved row 17 with seats together. They shoved us all almost completely in the back of the plane and split us up including my children. We tried to ask the flight attendants for some help but there was none. We just had to figure it out on our own. Was able to get my kids together at least because they had split up another 2 people and by just swapping seats in the same row it put family members together. You are at their will and the couldnt care less. As far as the mechanics of their jobs everyone performed as expected and there were no problems. I realize the seat assignments are not their responsibility but it might have been nice to have a little assistance and understanding.
We booked a roundtrip from Atlanta to Lima CM881 CM263 and Lima to Atlanta CM338 CM880. Both flights included a brief layover in Panama City. We also booked flights from Quito to Lima Booking No. SP6MHI Flights CM158 and CM337. This flight also included a brief layover in Panama City. The scheduled itinerary wouldve had us fly from Quito to Panama City then from Panama City to Lima then from Lima back to Panama City then Panama City to Atlanta. It occurred to us that the flights from Panama City to Lima and Lima back to Panama City might be able to be skipped so when we entered the Quito airport we spoke with a Copa Airlines desk agent about that possibility. She worked on the computer with another agent for about 15 minutes and printed our boarding passes only for Quito to Panama city and assured us that we could stay the night in Panama City and board our flight from Panama City to Atlanta in the morning. We stayed the night in Panama City as planned but when we arrived in Panama City airport this morning to board our flight to Atlanta we were shocked to find that because we didnt board the flight from Lima to Panama City our tickets from Panama City to Atlanta had been cancelled. We had been given assurances by Copa representatives in the Quito airport the previous day that this would not happen. We spent about an hour talking with Copa representatives in Panama City about this but they were unwilling to help or honor the assurance that we were given in Quito. We were forced to pay a 535 penalty fee to reinstate our cancelled tickets to Atlanta. This is frustrating in the extreme and totally unacceptable given that we sought and were given permission and assurances in Quito that everything was in order
Shenzhen to Beijing. It was a new Boeing 7879 with seating 121 which gave ample room and privacy. The seat could converted into a flat bed which is rare to find in any domestic flights. Three course dinner was served with good choice of red and white. The hostesses worked hard to get their job done as it was a two and half hour flight yet polite and attentive.
Whats the point of paying extra for priority boarding if when its time everyone is called to board at the same time Practices like that are just a rip off.
New York JFK to Doha. Qatar Airways third party ground handlers at New York JFK are useless. They do not follow any boarding method creating chaos on the ground. On this flight they ran out of all menu options for the meal service. The arrival in Doha was great until reaching a 3 hour queue for passport control. As a transit passenger connecting to another flight its a decent airport. Brand new aircraft was awesome providing lots of room definitely book this aircraft in future if flying Qatar.
It was a very good experience by flying Qatar Airways. Perfect check in on time comfortable seats on board entertainment and good food served in a very short time
Guayaquil Galapagos Quito. Plane cabin was in bad condition dirty and lots of things were broken. Through the cabin you could smell urine coming from the lavatory. No individual inflight entertainment just one drink served despite the fact that on the tickets it clearly says snack and lunch. A very disappointing service for that high ticket price you pay for flying to the Galapagos. There are two other competitor airlines which fly to Galapagos LAN and Aerogal. Both are much better then TAME I have flown with them. My advice avoid TAME if you can.
Absolutely the worst customer service and airline operation regarding my experience. I had a booking that was ORDKEF. Sounds good all is well then they cancelled the flight. So I call the customer service line no problem I called got my flight now routed ORDBOSKEF and then KEFJFKORD on the way back few days later I go to my journey page to make sure my seats are all squared away and the system doesnt recognize my itinerary. So I call again to customer service and they claim I took the voucher and they cancelled my flights. Why would I take a voucher when you have all proof of me calling talking to an agent and rerouting my trip. Makes no sense. So now that they wont reinstate my trip Im stuck with this voucher that now doesnt even cover the cost of my flights because they increased the prices and I purchased my flight 2 months ago unbelievable terrible service. And now I have to pay 550 extra for the same trip as their agent rerouted me on before they cancelled my itinerary.
First time with Japan Airlines. The flight to Tokyo was late at night so not much to report. The return flight was during the day and was mostly excellent. Highlights are the excellent service and the food. Just wonderful. Unfortunately there are lows and they related to hardware and software. The seat is comfortable however my window seat had almost no storage space except for among the magazines next to the screen see pic. The IFE is truly substandard. Very few movies the music select was small and in each category there were only a few tracks. Painful to operate as well. This is nickle and dime stuff in a premium product and a pity as the service is so very good.
Worst customer service ever. I bought a ticket for my mom and the airline cancelled my reservation and I never got notified yesterday I started to do the check it process and the ticket does not exist I called and nothing they can do I tried to buy a new ticket which its extremely expensive for tourist class. Their website wasnt working so they did a reservation my mom is now in the airport trying to pay and the second booking does not exist and her flight is today. No help at all from the airline or any of their agents.
They provided a very affordable and reliable flight. Especially the cabin attendants are at a level that can handle all my stress. It was a very quiet and enjoyable trip.
Melbourne to Coimbatore via Singapore. Singapore Airlines has disappointed us in the last three trips. The price they charge is so expensive but from Singapore to our destination we get to travel in budget airlines which is Scoot or silk air. It doesnt make sense at all. When we ask for help they say its a different management so we cant help you further. Moreover there is no special assistance in those low cost airlines. Also the Singapore airport was so warm and the air conditioner was not controlled well across.
Never again. For so many reasons. Several delays both ways. Coming back take off was supposed to be 445 pm actually took off at 930 Pm after being told screws were missing and they couldnt get what they needed. Everything just seemed to take forever and no one really knew what they were doing. Just dont do it. Its not worth the Pennies you may save by flying with them.
I had two straightforward uneventful flights with LIAT on 11th April 2016. The ANU to BGI flight was about fifteen minutes late and the BGI to DOM flight was about half an hour late. Checkin at V C Bird was quick and efficient while luggage was delivered promptly at Grantley Adams. Then checkin at Grantley Adams was also quick and efficient while luggage was delivered very quickly at Melville Hall. From getting off the plane at Melville Hall to leaving the airport took no more than twenty minutes. Staff on the ground at all three airports were highly professional and very polite and the same can be said of the cabin crew on both flights. If LIAT could replicate these standards on all their flights then there would be little to complain about.
London to Kochi via Delhi. Unless you have money to waste or want to be treated like a freeloader dont travel on Vistara. The staff both on ground and in flight treat the passengers like they are travelling for free. There is absolutely no respect given. On top of this the operations are terrible to say the least. The gates at Heathrow were announced 15 minutes before the gates closed. Considering the size of the airport it was highly inconvenient. The flights neither take of nor land in time. Our fight was supposed to depart from Delhi airport at 1555 as per their boarding pass. But they called us to check our baggage for something at around 1545 even though the luggage was cleared at Heathrow airport and Delhi customs. They made us wait for absolutely no reason for almost half an hour. We had to run back to the boarding gate so that we dont miss our flight. For the price we pay the service is pathetic to say the least. The staff who are hardly exist around the airport are so arrogant and rude. I would rather walk for a day or 2 than fly in a one hour flight of Vistara.
I bought tickets for flights and hotel however when I needed to cancel in good time the airline refused to refund me. The level of English was broken at best and there was no attempt on the part of the airline to understand and rectify the issue. The complaints process was long and difficult to use. I tried to use the discount voucher codes for Covid19 tests that the Aegean website was offering however there were issues with using the codes so there was no way of using discount. In an attempt to escalate the issue I used the service Resolver which is normally used as a last resort but this wasnt helpful as the airline simply did not engage in any way.
Rome to Sydney via Doha. Travelling with Qatar in business class was very good. I cant fault the service the courtesy of the staff but the business lounge they usein Rome is very disappointed with hardly any food.
They dont care for customers. Go first cancelled the flight abruptly. They dont even have courtesy msg or email to customer about cancellation. They can put you in any flight of the day or night without checking. Front desk is the worst they forgot basic courtesy. Very rude. Customers are last for them
Thomson Airways Boeing 787 and the worst seat possible to have is 27C next to toilet. Might as well have sat in the toilet. Ever time passengers went to visit the toilet I was nudged with no room to get past. This seat should be removed as very unsuitable. Flying for 10hours in a very cold cabin air con dripping above and crew using tissues to try to stop the water dripping onto passengers. Very disappointed with this aircraft.
Mauritius to Singapore. Flight was cancelled 3 hours before departure. No update was given to know what was the way forward especially since a connection was involved. When you call Air Mauritius the people were rude and could not help at all. It took 7 hours of timeless wait on the phone without someone to even lodge a decent complaint to finally get redirect to another flight combination with inconvenient timing. They do not even get the emails right. No compensation for the delay no apologies for the inconvenience. No miles no upgrade nothing. Its as if we need to be grateful that they actually redirected us for a ticket which we have paid for The service on board was below standards compared to the price but I never knew that the on ground customer service was so lousy as well.
My wife and I were traveling to Esbjerg from Aberdeen when we were denied boarding by gate agents. Due to an oversight by the ticketing agent we were required to have visas. By the time this mistake was resolved the flight departed. A formal complaint was filed with the handling agents but they denied all responsibility. We contacted customer care at BMI regional and within 24 hours received a reply. They refunded the fare of the missed flight and set forth a formal investigation into the incident at Aberdeen Airport. BMI regional took immediate action and did the right thing
Prague to Keflavik. Experience of the worst lowcost airline under the price of the traditional airline no online booking manager no fully usable mobile app callcentre operators without knowledge extralegroom seats with space of basic ones booking changes they do without letting you know. This airline is facing as a traditional and modern one. But reality becomes when I saw the type of aircraft I realize that I will fly with lowcost airline aircraft. I believed that for price 210 Ill get the full experience of the traditional airline. I prepaid food and seat in the first row. About one week later when I wanted to add baggage my booking manager site was empty no option to add more services. So I called the customer centre and I got information that this is happening often and its not possible to fix my booking manager and I have to manage everything via call centre the mobile app is useless you cant manage anything there you only see information about the flight. Then the operator also told me that my seat i paid for the first row was changed because of changing aircraft. I wasnt noticed before via mail or SMS that this happened. Not for least she also told me that this aircraft doesnt havekitchen so its not possible to have warm food there which I paid for. So I ask for another baggage and refund for food. One week later I tried to have another call and ask about my issue. Another operator told me that it is possible to have warm food on this flight. I was totally disappointed but at the and I order a paid for the food again with hope that second operator knows what she speaks about. During boarding I came to the oldest plane I can imagine from the most lowcost airline Smartwings. Legroom was tiny as in other B737 but my seat was priced as the extralegroom seat. The only one thing I was fine with was the food menu for 15.
Flew Hangzhou to Hong Kong at the beginning of April and had 2 of my best Dragonair flights to date. The flights were empty with PTV both ways as both flights on newly acquired A330300s from CX. The food and service was great I would say better in fact than CX. Both flights left on time and arrived early with the usual good updates from the flight deck and crew. I will keep flying KA when I have the chance.
We flew from Dubai at 2.45am to Sydney and were served breakfast about 4.30am. This was a decent meal but we were not offered anything more until 9 hrs later when the next meal was supplied not even water. After 7 hrs I went back to the curtained area and requested some water. There were about four flight attendants chatting and laughing behind the curtains. When we flew Singapore Airlines they could not do enough for you. Were were constantly asked if we needed water and they supplied fruit snacks and ice creams. Very disappointed in Emirates.
Sydney to Singapore. Biggest standout which are most important to me. Service staff have excellent communication are very proactive thoughtful and attentive to your needs. The flight was very smooth with the pilots communication being very clear. Food excellent without being flamboyant.
Bangkok to Los Angeles via Seoul on Asiana. First time with this airline. My family and I were all very pleasantly surprised to the level of service food quality attention to details such as tooth brush and personal kit even in Economy. The flight attendant were all incredibly kind and helpful. Unlimited drinks and the food was delicious. My original business class AC flight was cancelled due to Covid. I had not flown in economy overseas in over a decade and was very apprehensive with the long distance. Not that I would fly economy again but if I had to Asiana would be my first choice. Thank you for making this trip more pleasant.
Marseilles to Montreal via London. What I got from British Airways so far 3 flights 3 delays for a cumulated time of 5 hour and 15 minutes. Because of a 2 hours and 35 minutes delay in Montreal they made me miss my connection in London. They booked me on another flight which made me wait a further 4 hours in London instead of 2 hours. Now back to Montreal from Marseille my flight is delayed one more time. I am not what you would call a happy customer.
We flew XL France out of Paris. Searching their website was most unhelpful. Unlike Air Asia Tiger Air and Jetstar all are low cost carriers in Asia we found XL France website the least interactive with customers. Our attempts to communicate with XL France to purchase two seat upgrades met with a wall. We had to get friends in Paris to talk to them. Otherwise food in Premium economy was good. What saved. The day was a stewardess who was very professional with her excellent service to all. Leaving today 2013 for Paris fm Cancun and am told by XL I can only purchase an upgrade at the airport. So it means leaving early to wait in queue. You wished XL France could be more customer friendly.
First time I was flying back at 1pm rather than 1am. I thought I was going to struggle. That wasnt to be the case. Nice and easy flight. I do tend to find flying back physically easier maybe not mentally. Food was good and a sufficient amount of movies to watch. Only downside was the flight seemed to take a lot longer than ever before. Verging on 13 hours plus.
18 August 2014 Gatwick to Orlando flight details and departure went well. However when the food was served on the flight there was limited choice chicken or sausages which was fine until they ran out and then could only offer the veggie option which was pasta which my Father in Law doesnt eat so he ended up with 2 bread rolls as his lunchdinner. This was served within the first hour of our over 8 hour flight and then 7 hours later we were served a snack which only had one option coronation chicken chicken again which only 2 in our party of 6 liked. Again my Father in Law had nothing as he was 1 of the 4. Pretty poor show British Airways as we travelled with Virgin to Mexico in June this year economy class and they offered a menu with three choices for lunchdinner with enough for everyone Again when the snack was served option were given and enough for all. Virgin also provided a very good entertainment system with up to date films TV and games which was something you need on a long journey again BA was not able to provide. BA your competitors are definitely offering more value for our money I wouldnt not fly BA again as I dont like to limit my choices however I would definitely prefer to fly Virgin in future. In my opinion all flights should have enough food for all of their passengers and look at what they are offering as coronation chicken didnt go down well with a large number of passengers whats happened to good old ham or cheese
Hong Kong to Beijing. The flight is scheduled for 5pm and I boarded at 410. It was not until 630 that announcement was made to abandon the flight due to a technical problem. The flight was rescheduled for 9pm and took off at around 930. The compensation is that the boarding pass is worth HKD75 for a meal but that at HKG airport can buy nothing more than a hamburger. We arrived in Beijing well after midnight and my land connection were ended for the day. I can check in at the airport hotel only after 2am. Yes they did say sorry but they dont even mean it. I am resentful that we are kept in the cabin for 2 hours perhaps to prevent passengers to rebook an earlier flight A nightmare of a flight. Cathay Pacific is not a bad airline but other airlines have better ontime record.
Johannesburg to Mumbai via Mahe connecting to Hyderabad with Jet Airways. Flight was delayed in Mahe Airport for 4 hours then we missed connecting flight in Mumbai and we waited more then 5 hours in Mumbai Airport as they booked flights. There was no one to help us it was bad customer service. Passengers were struggling to get the tickets for connecting flights. They made us to stood at counter for more then 2 hours tickets had to be booked before we reach Mumbai Airport but they booked later we reached in Mumbai airport. Accommodation must be provided if there is a delay for more then 4 hours but they didnt provide anything and didnt respond well in Mumbai Airport.
Flew ATL to LHR 8th Jan 2023. Was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777. Refit gave it a decent IFE screen and the seat looked decent. Although combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds and any movie can be ruined. Headrest was great just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets. Toilet seats old stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinkssnacks offered. Meal was sent out after a couple of hours. Was poor. Chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll salad which was rice and carrots Dried crackers with no cheese. Kids meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal Snack was decent for the adults bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it. Very very poor. Mix the food BA service with a grunt being crammed into a seat for 7 hours landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion is terrible. This flight was so disappointing. Other than one great member of cabin crew everything else was just average.
Baku to Tbilisi. I had 2 terrible experiences with Buta Airways. First flight was delayed 3 hours for no reason. Then at checkin I was fined for not checking in online however there is no mention on the ticket or confirmation email anywhere that you need to do online checkin. I asked for a window seat and was given an Aisle when I asked to move onboard as the flight wasnt full I was told it would cost 25 They also dont allow any hand luggage apart from a handbag or laptop bag. Not even a plastic bag Now my return flight is also delayed 4 hours. All in all a very poor experience.
Singapore to Denpasar. Poor flight. Average food. No pillows available at the economy cabin. Old aircraft. Seats at the vertical position very uncomfortable. Ground service unpolite.
Over the past 40 years Ive travelled to many destinations around the world on many different airlines but none of them have even come close to punching above its weight than Air Niugini. Ive been flying Air Niugini ever since I was pleasantly surprised over 18 months ago and the experience has been consistently great. It is what one would expect from an airline but to deliver a world class service amidst challenges is what makes Air Niugini stand out for me.
Flew back from Barbados to Newcastle after a Thomson Cruise. This was probably the best Thomson flight we have had there were complimentary drinks entertainment newspapers etc and I have to say the food provided was good by airline standards. The plane was a 767 and probably only a couple of years old. I would have given 10 for satisfaction if it had not been for a 2 hour delay.
Paris to Montreal via Keflavik. I had never ever seen an airline like this. Its been 7 months that Ive been waiting for my 900 compensation for a cancelled flight. I was stuck in Iceland for 24h. They keep telling me the payment is in process but they are never paying me. Its in process since 5 months. No respect for the aerial transporters european laws no respect for the clients no respect for nothing Never book a flight with them.
18th April Manchester to Verona and returned 25th April. Flight ZB1316 and ZB1317. Cant understand the bad reviews flew out of Manchester on time and landed early in Italy. Pleasant crew ground staff great booked extra leg room seats and being 6ft 3inches tall and not a small fella in size I was very surprised that the additional space was fantastic. No need to ask for a extension belt as the seat belts were more than big enough. New style seats are fine for short flights and very comfy indeed. Did not order food just a wee cup of tea to pass the time. Flight back left early and landed early all in all no complaints whatsoever.
Hadnt flown Nepal Airlines in years. Very impressed. Friendly checkin ontime departure comfortable seats with winged headrests on the new A320. Legroom was better than on the Jet Airways Boeing 737 of the outbound flight. Impressive hot lunch served on a 1 hour 10 minute flight better than what Jet Airways serves on the same route.
Singapore to Munich and travelled this sector twice within 6 months so my review is based on mix of both. Boarding at Changi is consistent and zone wise boarding. Checkin staff passport and boarding card checks are very friendly. On boarding the flight crew looked less enthusiastic then I know of. There was a sense of disorganisation. The senior crew jetted through cabin with a frown and certainly created a negative environment. Once in the air meal and drink service was conducted. I use book the cook service and was served about 30 mins before fellow passengers which I find bit awkward. Again the meals can be elabotate for this class but I found portions are small and not filling. Service lacked enthusiasm warmth and smile on both the sectors and cabin crew were indifferent. Some were good and some were kind of forced to work. SIA provides good entertainment system so while watching movies I decided to get a snack from middle galley and crew were friendly but didnt see them throughout the flight atleast on my side of aisle. On one of the flight I asked for a coffee and it was brewed very strong even by European standards with the reason given that Europeans only drink strong coffee. The crew in back galley were sad and angry. On the positive side SIA 777300 has spacious toilets. Entertainment system is good and seat is spacious enough for the class. All in all MUC flights are out of Singapore Airlines pattern. I read review of another passenger in this forum also travelling to MUC and found to be negative. I have made some good experiences on thier other sectors and based on it I do recommend Singapore Airlines. I hope SIA will rectify the crew issue on this segment and hear the plight in catering segment for Premium Economy on all segments.
Vienna to Podgorica with Montenegro Airlines Fokker 100 old model aircraft. Enough space for legs nice cabin crew but unfortunately they only speak in Serbian language. Good snacks and drinks and value for the money. However no web check in and their partner Austrian Airlines had technical issues for 2 days so I cant check in via web.
Another airline removing customer service. On a business trip to St. Petersburg Russia for a week decided to pay a little extra for flexible tickets in case I would finish up early and I did. Go to the Finnair site a few days ahead of return tip select an earlier flight and get told the fee for the new ticket would be 0 excellent. When confirming the change a generic error message comes up and the site does not allow me to do anything further. I immediately try contacting their customer chat but after navigating the chatbot menus for a few minutes it puts me in line for an operator then immediately hangs up because the volume of requests is too high. The next day I log on to their site again and this time my new flight shows up under the booking great I then reasonably assume the change went through as planned and that the error only came at a later step in the process. A few more days of my trip pass until its time to checkin and only when trying to do so does another error message appear telling me I cant checkin and to contact Finnair specifically at a number in Finland. Obviously calling an overseas customer service number is pretty annoying with queues and all but I do so and spend 30 minutes waiting to no avail no queue number is given only that they are currently receiving an exceptional number of requests. At this point I am running out of time but feel my best bet at actually getting service will be at the airport counter itself so I make sure to arrive there with an hour extra to spare. There is no Finnair staff at the airport but the local Russian ground staff are very helpful basically explaining that the system says I need to pay a EUR100 fee to complete the rebooking. This was not the info I was given on the Finnair site when requesting the rebook and does not make sense with my ticket category having free rescheduling but after spending 90 minutes at the airport trying to sort this out with both ground staff and myself trying to reach Finnair I relent and pay the extra fee instead of missing my flight entirely. I obviously know it will be a nightmare to reclaim this from the airline later but I swear to at least try. On my return flight I have a connection in Helsinki Finnairs home airport so here I figure at least I can talk to their staff in person and get a little more clarity. I dont have time to leave the security area and seek out the ticketing office but I track down two of Finnairs transfer desks at least but they are both unmanned Since returning home last night I have tried their chat twice more again I get disconnected immediately because the volume of requests is too high. I obviously cannot find an email address to contact them at and I simply dont have the patience to be in a phone queue for hours. So in sum multiple individuals me my wife airport ground staff have tried to reach Finnair through multiple means phone chat inperson at home airport without any luck all to understand why their website has failed to rebook my flight at the listed price then not informed about the issue they created either so I could address it prior to actually traveling. If you want to be one of those digital companies with 0 customer interaction then at least make a website that works.
Travelling Manchester to Guernsey GY671 on 19 December 2012. The 17.10 flight was delayed until the next day due to bad weather. Aurigny kept us informed arranged coach transport from and to airport to Crowne Plaza Hotel with very good Evening meal and Breakfast. Next morning offered a drinks voucher at the Airport as we could not take off until 11.45.
Perth to Cape Town via Johannesburg. I am so disappointed with SAA I will never fly with them again. Horrible customer service and even worse I was not seated in a row with the kids 3 kids thankfully I was changed after kicking up a storm and refusing to sit through a 13 hr flight with 3 seats and someone sitting next to us in the row as well. They eventually told me that I had to pre select the seats although every time I went online it said seating to be selected 3 hours prior to departure. when we arrived to Johannesburg we missed our connecting flight to Cape Town because the flight was delayed in Perth we had to wait 7 Hours for the next flight because there were no seats and then to top it off we were offered nothing in the way of the guest lounge or food vouchers. It was actually beyond ridiculous. On the way back we arrived to Melbourne only to be told all our luggage had been misplaced and they had no idea where it was. We received our luggage 2 days later it was left outside of our house. Also whilst on all of the flights my 5 yr old daughter got nothing to eat. The agent never requested a childs meal which I understand that was his mistake although they didnt even offer my child an adult meal on every single flight they had nothing for her why they didnt request the childs meal after the first flight I have no idea. They also gave my nearly 2 year old food for a 6 month old for the infant food. My travel agent has requested an explanation from SAA and so far after 2 months have only said sorry and attached their terms of conditions which dont answer a thing as their explanation. The travel agent is offering us a store credit as he feels bad about what has happened.
Chiang Mai to Los Angeles via Taipei. Excellent service and clean aircraft. Checkin is orderly and my flights were on time. EVA is wonderful. The crews on this and all EVA flights are so well trained and professional.
Customer Service was extremely poor at CDG Airport. No agents available to answer questions or assist withe kiosks etc. No separate check in for business class and most checkin done by passengers after they figured out how to print bag tags and load bags on belt. The service in business was unbelievable. We were on board 1.5 hours with a posted ATC delay and waiting for late passengers. No preflight service offered. After departure only given drinks during lunch service. I had to go to attendants station to request a wine refill but it never showed for my wife or self. Finally after ringing on service button mine showed but not wifes. For two meals I was served two pasta dishes. Ive had better service in Coach. Bottom line we will never again fly AF.
I purchased additional carryon option so that I can carry two bags up to 14Kg. At the checkin desk however I was told one of the luggage was too big and had to be checkedin with 55000 KRW pay. I protested that it should be allowed to be carried in because its almost the same dimension as my other luggage only looking bigger because its an oldfashioned twowheeler. Of course my protest was not accepted although the manager admitted it was on the borderline. That was first of frustration that ruined our 60th birthday trip. On arriving Sydney then we learned our connecting flight to Brisbane was cancelled and we had to stay overnight in Sydney screwing our itinerary We managed to find late flight from another airline that the staff at the Jetstar refused to find themselves. Frustrating start of the trip. On the way back I was ready to pay for checkin the problem luggage but the staff at the checkin desk said it is allowable so I carried in both bags So the same luggage depending on who the desk staff was was not allowed one way and allowed the other way. So if you want to buy additional option for the carryon luggage pray you get the right staff at the checkin desk. Otherwise youd have to pay extra around 40 US dollar for checkin without getting the extra checkin option payment reimbursed. I complained this to the customer service and of course the person I chatted with said there was nothing she could do it. So once happened there is little to no chance to get your money reimbursed. Just beware the checkin luggage policy can be very arbitrary.
Aurigny Customer Service staff must be the worst in the world the recent fog caused some delays at U.K airports whilst still on the island having a meal before my flight at a local restaurant I heard that there was flight delays so I telephone Aurigny to find out how long etc I was told no all is well get here on time. Turned up for my 5.15pm flight at just before 4pm and was immediately told story five hour flight delay nothing we can do went to customer services who were useless. Whilst I was speaking to a man there a lady in the back ground put a leaflet on the counter in front of me and said its all in there and went back to her seat and sat down the leaflet was about delays great customer service. We went upstairs and ordered some snacks and drinks and just as I paid tannoy announced that our flight was now leaving ASAP and was going to Liverpool not Manchester and that a coach would be there waiting to take us to Manchester. We left everything checked in and then sat for over an hour in departures. Finally arriving at Liverpool guess what no coach and no one aware of this arrangement eventually a Liverpool airport member of staff said she was arranging a coach for us some people asked if a taxi would be paid for by Aurigny and they were told no now near 10pm and most of the passengers now left making their own way to Manchester the member of staff returned and said she may have a coach for us and then said where is everyone. Well they have all gone was the reply and we are off too thanks for the help. Aurignys objective was just to get shut thanks to them I had to make my own way to Manchester at 11pm collect my car and then drive back through the thick fog getting home at near 1am it would have been safer for all just to get the next safe flight out. When I telephone Aurigny for a refund for the taxi I was told no chance not our fault and once off the island not our problem and that they are not part of the EU rules. When I tried to put my point I was then told by the young girl on the phone that she was now terminating the call. After a couple of calls I have now been told that I am getting my Taxi fare back but thats it no compensation for the delay at Liverpool as we were off the island and not their problem. Customer services at the airport and on the phone score nil urgent training required nothing complex just the art of communication would be a good start how to talk to people.
Flew with SmartLynx from Kos to Gatwick as a replacement for our easyjet flight in June 2022. Flight was 2 hours late departing because of air traffic restrictions. Staff polite. Clean plane. Flight was 3 hours 27 mins. No food on board due to catering restrictions but the bar was ok. Gleaming white plane with easyjet logo on each side. My only complaint was that as the plane was 15 years old the seats although reclined were very hard and need replacing as they gave me a numb bum after one hour solved that by sitting on my jacket. Overall I would say dont believe the negative reviews of this airline.
This is the worst airline my family has flown with Food was so terrible. Everything is disorganized almost no English is spoken by people on the planes or at the counters inside the US or in Panama. They do not take care of your baggage either. Lost my 23k suitcase and did not provide me with a number to call or any information other than it can take 21 business days for them to find my bag. Everything was horrible except for the leg room in the plane that was decent. Dont expect any customer service either
Comfortable and ontime service with a super friendly and welcoming crew for my first flight on this airline. Even the pilots took time to engage with my 3 children would not hesitate to recommend and fly Airlink again when back in the region.
Jakarta to Tokyo Haneda in First Class. Yet another excellent flight on Garuda Indonesia. As it was a late night flight I chose to sleep and had preordered my breakfast which was served approx. 1.5 hours prior to landing. The food was delicious. The crew were very friendly helpful and provided excellent service they really made the flight enjoyable. We arrived in Haneda Tokyo on time and I was escorted via immigration and customs by the Garuda Haneda ground staff. Overall great flight and experience. Garuda Indonesia also provides a free wifi voucher and the connectivity was excellent.
Brussels to Madrid. The experience was of such a kind that next time I will take another airline the difference in fare between economy and business is substantial so I think passengers are entitled to receive something decent for the amount paid. The breakfast did consist of 2 wrapped packages of 25 g of some cold cuts one croissant and one small yoghurt no sign of fruit jam butter or decent bread when asking a second cola zero with ice I got a look if I was asking for a bottle of champagne. Disastrous for business in full very unfriendly FA flight took some delay only positive fact was that the gates for connecting flights were announced.
Istanbul to London. I am sad to say British Airways is little more than a budget airline masquerading as a really very expensive one. It hard to see any difference between my flight experience on a budget airline and British airways except the ticket price. My disappointment is so high because I had high expectations I paid extra for a more comfortable trip and instead felt totally ripped off every possible shortcut is taken to ensure your discomfort and their profit margins. I havent flown British Airways for years and I shocked by how much it had gone downhill. It is riding on its once good reptutation and short changing customers Save you coins for something else you dont get what you pay for with British airways.
I took advantage of incredible airfares for a short trip to Sydney and cant fault my flights. From checkin to the Cabin crew especially Andy and all ground crew I interacted with everything was spot on. For a short flight they certainly delivered and I experienced the same on my return flight to Melbourne. Its about time Australia had such a friendly and service oriented airline.
Being a silver flyer and booking a flight through BA to Dublin you would have thought I could use the lounge even though BA used Air Lingus for the flight. Travelled recently there with the same situation and was allowed in by a kind Gentleman at the desk even though he said I had to be Gold He was really accommodating and it wasnt a big deal. But the two ladies on the desk were like no. No empathy there at allsaying the other guy shouldnt have let me and they will have a word with him Come on BA I booked the flight through you and you made me fly with Air Lingus so you should let me use the lounge as a silver flier.
Poor experience on this airline. Im writing this review from the gate where Im attempting to fly from Barbados to St Vincent. Showed up to the airport 3 hours early. About 10 passengers were pulled aside during boarding and told we wouldnt be on the flight because due to unfortunate circumstances the plane was full. They pulled me aside after my traveling companion had already boarded so we got separated. Then they rerouted his plane through Grenada. I was told they would put me on another flight about 3 hours later however that flight is now delayed without much info on why or how long its delayed. There are about 75 people at this gate that thought they were making various flights and now are sitting around with some mix of sadness anger and bewilderment. I was given a 13 USD voucher for my trouble.
What a shambles and I will never fly with Air France again. This flight was 1.5 hours late which seems normal for that flight. AF had tried to throw me off my connecting flight and put me on one for the next day but the checkin girl at BKK managed to reverse it and I made the flight. I asked on exit how far away my next gate was but they didnt have a clue. A 232 business class is decades out of date and the cabin crew were men who did their job in a minimalist manner but there was no friendliness or engagement with the passengers downright miserable. The food felt very overly reheated. There looks like a lot of pages of movies but a lot of it was many copies of the same film no idea what that was about as you choose your language when you click on play. They get round their terrible performance by using that awful and insulting catchall phrase For operational reasons. When we landed at CDG there was another plane still at our gate.
Taiyuan to Shanghai. China Eastern has a dedicated checkin and security screening area at Taiyuan airport for business class customers which is nice. However the lounge was very small with no toilet. The aircraft cabin was similar to domestic shorthaul equipment in the US with recliners for business class. Cabin service was excellent. Meal was nicely presented though I dont find it tasty. Overall it was a decent domestic flight.
New York to Gatwick on lowfare ticket. Check in rude to me. Flight attendants unprofessional to me. Cabin freezing and they charge 8 for a blanket. Food is rubbish my dietary requirements not available. Toilet I used was filthy. Inflight entertainment not working. So disappointed.
Siem Reap to Chiang Mai via Bangkok. Worst experience ever. Extra hidden charge for luggage. Tickets 182. 2 pieces Luggage 20 Kg ea 560. Seriously. 15 Kg limit at the counter 20 Kg with online checkin but the system wouldnt let us checkin online. We were told to go to counter. None of these rules can be found on their website. They charged us for each leg on a single trip.
Since March 16th trying to get refund for our April ticket to Madeira and back via Flightfinder who so far has provided all the necessary info that we have asked them about but Binter Canarias keeps refusing their responsibility and keeps sending our requests back to Flightfinder. We liked this airline but this is just unfair policy towards its customers.
This is a basic no frills airline. We flew from Naples to NYC in early Sept. 2016 economy. The flight was delayed by about 2 hours partly due to weather the previous day and partly due to a very poor boarding procedure at the Naples airport likely not Meridianas fault. The plane was pretty old with no charging stations or any entertainment system. The service was very good the staff spoke English and were professional and mostly nice. The food was average. The seats were of average comfort legroom and cleanliness. Blankets and pillows were provided free of charge. The flight was uneventful. It cost around 300 one way and I think thats a very good bang for the buck. If you dont care about bells and whistles like entertainment system Id recommend using this airline to fly into andor out of Italy.
Its nothing too special but it was definitely an affordable price. The inflight food and beverage was comprised of a juice box and bottled water. The customer service is ok. There was in issue with the website where it continually declined my card but it actually charged my card every time I attempted meaning with four attempts there were 750 in false charges. Fortunately the customer service could be reached by WhatsApp and they were able to refund me for the imaginary flight bookings.
The online wifi and entertainment system is limited and old many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi live TV numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens. The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching advertisement after takeoff and before each movieseries. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World.
As an elite gold flyer I am promised priority check in and best seats available I got neither. Now I am on Scoot to Bangkok from Singapore. Same issues though this time on cheaper ticket though still entitled to elite gold privileges. First world problem but if they dont honor their promises whats the point.
Hanoi to Osaka Kansai. First time to fly Vietnam airlines and we were not impressed. The food in economy was terrible crew did their bare minimum and we could see them sleeping in their crew seats during take off and landing. Also the plane wasnt cleaned properly crumbs and wrappers on the floor. The good thing was the IFE which was very user friendly and quite a few selections.
We had some troubles getting to the airport and were so worried we were going to be late. We arrived at the check in counter just a few minutes late but the Jin Air employees were so kind and accommodating. They got us through security and to our gate and we made a flight we otherwise would have definitely missed. Just so grateful Thank you
Horrible airline. Will not be flying with them again. I was supposed to fly a few days ago with Virgin Australia but they delayed my flight 15 hours and did not provide a refund. Really unhappy with them.
Me and my daughter were in Cyprus and could not leave on our Qatar Airways return ticket from Melbourne to Larnaca due to the Covid19 lockdown. However we managed to get on a UK charter flight to Manchester via Doha to Melbourne recently. This review should really cover the Manchester to Melbourne flight via Doha. We required wheelchair assistance and medical oxygen so it was not a straight forward flight. We have so many people to thank and especially Qatar Airlines which will be the subject of the review here. Customer service was excellent. Qatar Cyprus Eleni reached out to us to assist us. Qatar Airways waived all charges for changing the route completely. Once they approved the wheelchair and oxygen they swung into action we had excellent assistance from Check in to boarding and then disembarking. We were told many times that they will take care of the medical needs by the cabin crew who checked on us frequently during the flight. At Doha we were picked up and transported to the different gates effortlessly and efficiently and were allowed to stop to get some sandwiches We have nothing but the utmost praise for the cabin crew Flights QR 28 and QR 904 11th May 2020 for looking after us. Safety due to virus From videos to cleaning the toilets frequently and wearing the appropriate safety gear they kept us safe during the flight. It cant be easy on the cabin crew as they are exposed to passengers all the time so they are like frontline healthcare professionals. My deep respect for the cabin crews. Qatar Airways We will get you home catch cry at the moment. Thank you Qatar for getting us home. Whilst most major airlines abandoned us you kept flying. You upgraded your safety levels to manage the virus and you kept flying. You are the only major airline that kept flying to Australia. You deserve an award for this. Thank you for flying and as one of your ground staff in Doha said Qatar will always keep flying no matter what. We wish you the staff and everyone all the best.
Blue Islands flights from Cambridge to St Helier Jersey. These flights operate on Saturdays only during the summer months and are so convenient for East Anglian holiday makers. The flight of 50 minutes was comfortable and efficient in the ATR 42. The ease of travel made us feel we had slipped back 3 decades to a time when air travel was much more pleasurable. On board there were complimentary non alcoholic drinks. There was a modest and welcoming lounge with complimentary drinks and biscuits on our departure from Jersey airport.
Booked a 5 tickets with Icelandair in Denver Colorado last Sunday. I paid 35 a seat each way for all five members of in my party. We realized that we had booked the wrong row for two of the members of our flight and have been trying to upgrade. I have been told that I will need to pay the full 80 per person each way to upgrade to the row in front of the other three passengers and they will keep my 35 per person each way. Just for reference thats a total of 460 for a seat on the airplane. Just for further reference thats equivalent to a one way ticket. We have never flown with Icelandair never will again and would strongly discourage anyone from booking with them.
Midnight flight departing Singapore to London on A380 in economy class not the favourite way to start a trip. Boarding was efficient and uncomplicated although the sheer size of the A380 makes for a busy boarding process. We found ourselves on one of SQs newest A380800 aircraft decked out in the new economy class setting with updated seating and AVOD. This configuration has economy and premium economy on the lower deck and the very premium seats on the upper deck. We were in the 2nd most front row of economy near to the galley. Seats were relatively comfortable by Economy standards with a new styled headrest. The AVOD was presented with a large touch screen and is now line with the likes of Emirates. Food choices were pretty good mostly edible and service was pleasant if not enthusiastic. We departed and arrived on time and it was as tolerable as longhaul economy can be I believe.
Flew FLL to LAX earlier this month. We were flying back from a cruise. The flight was unfortunately delayed 90 minutes. Once onboard the pilot apologized sincerely and gave everyone unlimited movies through the inflight entertainment system for their inconvenience. In a world where airlines strand passengers on the tarmac for 7 hours United 41815 with no apologies its nice to know that at least one airline still cares for its customers. I am a loyal flyer
Delhi to Cairns via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Great service helpful staff and lovely food with good movies. A staff member helped me a lot while in the boarding pass queue which was great. Good people good food.
We were in Jeju flying to Busan then connecting to Gimpo. I noticed our flight was delayed and we may miss the connection. I queried this with ground staff. Within 16 minutes our flights were changed at no cost 4 peoples luggage located dragged across the airport by tiny female ground staff identified and reloaded then we were seated in row 1 of the airline and off to Gimpo. Totally amazing. I am still astounded that this happened. Plus a refund on our original flight. Congratulations Air Busan. If I could I would fly this airline regularly customer service appears to be top of their list.
We flew from St Maarten to Bonaire via Curacao. When we checked in we were told that the flight would start 7 hours later. In fact the delay came up to 8 hours. We got a voucher 8 but in St. Maarten you cannot buy much more than a cappuccino for 8. Because we started so late we had to stay Curacao overnight in a hotel were the bar was already closed so we had to drink water from the tap. We reached Bonaire a day later. The staff could give us no reason for the delay of the flight and the socalled Supervisors were disinterested unfriendly and incompetent and arrogant. There was no compensation for the rental car and the hotel already booked on Bonaire. Customer satisfaction is a foreign word for Island air.
Picked Germania because they offer the only nonstop connection between Berlin Schonefeld and Teheran. The plane was in very good condition. Legroom was ok compared to other lowcost airlines but still pretty tight for a 5 hour flight. Service was very good with three rounds of free nonalcoholic drinks a warm meal and a cake along with coffee. They also offered free magazines and newspapers to everybody. Inflight entertainment consistent of maps and one movie. The crew was friendly and the flight almost in time. I would definitely choose Germania again as they offer good value for money
Dubai to Manchester. I am Emirates Gold passenger. The A380 business class cabin and service is fabulous and they always meet expectations. My family love this airline and my son loves the entertainment system. They look after regular fliers very well.
We were diverted to Delaware because of weather in New Haven at 1200 417 we landed in Delaware at 200 weather was clear in New Haven by 300 our ride that was waiting verified this. We were never informed of when we would fly out even as we asked multiple times finally left at 630 but when we landed in New Haven we were kept on the plane for 1.5 hours before we were able to get off the plane. Unacceptable will never fly Avelo again
Puerto Vallarta to Mexico City. Due to the coronavirus we were forced to cancel our trip to Mexico and as a result had to cancel all of our flights. Please do not waste your time with this company as their extreme lack of customer service is pathetic. Our other airlines were great in offering refunds but Interjet failed miserably at even picking up the phone or answering several emails. Let me tell you that sitting on the phone waiting for someone to pick up for hours is not how I would like to be spending my evenings. All they want is to your money. Again do not waste your time with this airline just take your business elsewhere.
Los Angeles to Paris CDG. After being a loyal AF customer for all flights to Europe this trip is the last straw. I keep hoping they will turn things around but things are only going downhill. First my biggest complaint has always been cleanliness. Most of the times I fly business and even in business the seat areas are filthy. I always bring wipes to do it myself. No matter how many times Ive left this feedback nothing changes. On an international flight cleaning down the seating areas is not too much to ask. Besides this I got to experience premium economy recently due to no availability in business at all. It was underwhelming to say the least. Seats were uncomfortable service was minimal and in general nothing validated the up charge from economy. The biggest reason I will no longer fly AF is the lack of customer care from phone support to airport I experienced recently. What is going on with them recently Anytime you need phone support the answer ranges from nothing we can do to youll have to ask at the airport. At the airport at CDG presumably their home base where services should be stellar lines of 20 were building up due to lack of personnel at all checkin points. Literally 1 maybe 2 in some lines check in agent for all lines regardless of status or priority. Whats more They have people waiting with absolutely no distinction between checking in for foreigners vs EU residents and yet we get to the front after 30 minutes in line and tell us we need to be in another line. Which looks like its going to be at least 1 hour with one agent at the desk with 20 people in line and building Ask for help. They just ignore you by saying not their problem with a shrug of their shoulder. Seriously AF and its workers with their haughty attitudes needs to realize with no customers theres no airline and subsequently no jobs. Whatever the internal issues and gripes are between the company and its workers paying customers should not have to feel like beggars asking for service that we paid for.
Had a delay of more than 9 hours. Completely understandable that weather conditions made this happen. But the irony is that for 5 hours in a row they made delay announcement for 1 hour only. So they kept the entire crew next to the gate. And by 4 oclock in the morning they offered refreshments to us and told us flight wont happen at a minimum until 8am in the morning.
Worst experience ever. Flight delayed then cancelled. Offered hotel voucher but one person for a line as big an aircraft capacity. Five people were helped in 2 hours. Then we got cards that says were closed and she left. Voucher for food was 12. A hamburger is 25. Doesnt matter they were all closed. Then delay to another gate to delayed again. We had the plane from last night. They said we could leave are bags on board. So we have a plane with no crew or pilot. Every AA employee was pretty rude and wouldnt do anything for you. Im cancelling my AA credit card because I dont want to use American airlines ever again.
Excellent flight. Almost empty flight. Had the entire row for both me and my partner. Shouldve saved money and not pay for seat assignment. Did have to pay for extra luggage but that was expected. No food ordered. Only hot food option on menu was a I think ravioli. Didnt matter as we had prepared food to eat on the plane. Ground crew was friendly and efficient. Flight crew was overworking unnecessarily by checking the overhead compartment every 30 minutes.
Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
Worst airline experience of my life. Delayed on the runway before take off for 4 hours due to a paperwork issue caused by the airline. You would think that after causing such a delay they might try to make everyone happy by offering snacks or beverages for free but no. No acknowledgement of fault by the crew. When we arrived at our destination we waited on the runway for 2 more hours for a terminal to open up. The airline offered a 50 credit towards a future flight for me but didnt offer one for my two year old son whose seat I paid for. It doesnt matter anyways because Ill never fly this airline again.
I travelled via Bamboo Airways to Ho Chi Minh on 3rd May 2023 and returned to the UK on 23rd May 2023. The flights were fantastic the crew were very friendly and helpful. No complaints whats so ever. Would definitely fly Bamboo Airways again.
When I fly from Jakarta to Zurich transit Dubai on 19 august the cabin crew was unpolite Isit in the middle between my husband and my daughter they ask my husband and my daughter for dinner but did not ask me so I call the bell for dinner and told that I am running out of food choices. Very disappointing.
The service quality ground and cabin is well worth the money spent. Quality of food is good with 2 choices. The airline is punctual.
Hong Kong Airlines seems to be going strong despite of the recent rumours about their financial hardship. For this route HX deployed an Ex SIA A330 plane with old style angle lie flat seat at 222 configuration. Its from the 90s but still at acceptable condition. Leg room and seat pitch are acceptable only its a bit cramped when in fully flat position. This is ok for short haul flights like this one so no complaints. Catering and wine selection is average. Beef is a typically difficult type of meat to serve and get right on board. My beef dish was tough so I ate only half. Despite these short comings what makes HX shine are their well trained cabin crew who are courteous and hard working. They are also very proactive and see to my every need throughout the flight reminds me of how things used to be in the long gone past. They have a very good on board duty free catalog that offers some unique items. Fast track was given to help speed through immigration process. Priority bags are amongst the first to be delivered. Overall a very impressive experience.
We booked a flight from Madrid to Los Angeles with American Airlines from MAD to London Heathrow with IB and from there a flight to LAX with AA. We only had 90 minutes to catch the connecting flight so when our IB flight was delayed for over 2 hours we knew that we werent going to make our connecting flight. I spoke with an IB employee while we were still in Madrid and asked them if we should still fly to LHR since were missing the connecting flight or at the very least start making accommodations for an alternate connecting flight. The IB employee said that theres nothing they can do at MAD so we should take the flight to LHR and that they would figure it out once we arrive to London. We arrive at London 3 hours late 2 hrs from the delay at MAD and another hour at the gate at LHR because the door was jammed and they couldnt get it open. Once we finally got out there were no IB employees at LHR they leave at 8pm so we went to AAs customer service. Well AA cant help us because its IB who was delayed. Only problem is that all IB employees are gone for the night they wont return until 6am and their 24hour customer service is trash. The IB customer service reps that I spoke with said that since I bought the tickets from AA that its AA and not IB who have to book me a new flight home. After 4 different phone calls totalling 90 minutes on the phone IB was able to book us a flight to Paris and from Paris take a 13hour flight to LAX. Also not once did they mention that we can get a hotel for the night and that they would have to reimburse us. However we know our rights as airline passengers and when I mentioned this the IB reps were vague as to how I can get reimbursed or what my allowance was.
First time flying Horizon and no problems noted on any of the flights. Seattle to Portland Portland to Santa Rosa and Reno to Seattle. All flights on the Q400 which I found to be an excellent plane. Flight crews were professional and appeared to enjoy their jobs
Hamburg to Bristol. Always late which they blame on air traffic control. No info at gate stating delay have to rely on flight stats. Always park miles away from terminal so long bus journey to and from aircraft
The checkin staff is slow the aircraft are dated and unkept. The wheelchair desk is unresponsive the airline ground staff makes us feel like they are doing a huge favor by letting us fly their airline.
Ground and flight crews were excellent. Flight was efficient and comfortable. But Ill never fly Air Canada Rouge or otherwise again. This was originally a BOSYYT itinerary via YUL. 11 hrs before departure at 2315 we got texts that the BOSYUL flight was cancelled. We were offered rebooking more than a day later via Halifax with a very tight connection. We opted to DRIVE to Montreal instead and catch the original second leg but AC had already removed us from that flight. There was no way to rebook this online no chat no reply to DM only the reservations tollfree number which I called at midnight. I spoke with an agent at 330 am I was on hold for 3.5 hrs. She restored the booking but not the seats my wife and I were separated on the flight. We drove at 7am and caught the flight out of YUL. At the airport we tried to find a desk that could give us info about a refund for the BOSYULBOS legs. We were told that could only be done via the reservations tillfree number. There was no booking desk at the airport. And still no reply to DMs. After we completed the trip and drove home from Montreal now 9 days after the flight was cancelled no word about the refund. So I called again and spent two more hours on hold. The agent who finally answered said he had no idea how refunds work they would need to prorate the refund. There was no way to contact them no idea when Id hear anything. He resubmitted the file to refunds dept. Theres no online chat DMs dont work executives dont reply to emails theres no desk at the airport and the call center is clearly understaffed. Im clearly owed a refund for the flight they cancelled but have no idea how much or whether Ill see it in days or months. Nobody takes responsibility. Its a shame because the flight experience itself was lovely. But this airline is a mess.
Outward bound flight was a joke when we booked in we got the boarding passes for the seats that we had prebooked for 45. Flight arrived in to Belfast International from Humberside and when we boarded the aircraft we found a family sitting in our seats. When I spoke to the head of the cabin crew he told me to find an empty seat anywhere on the aircraft. Everything on the flight was priced in Euros and the staff was unable to work out the exchange rate on both flights and charged everyone in sterling. The toilets were a disgrace less said the better. The aircraft was an A320 which was over 20 years old and should have been scraped a long time ago. There was no safety whatsoever on the plane we landed with rubbish all over the floors tables still down and many had their seat back still down. This company should not be taking people on holidays until they train their staff to the standards that is expected in 2013.
Jakarta to Tokyo Narita. I love ANA is the best airline in the world. The best ANA flight attendant service and very helpful. I want to fly to Japan using All Nippon Airways again.
Malaga to Birmingham. Originally a Monarch Airlines flight this was operated by Omni Air International chartered in by the CAA. The aircraft was excellent and spotless and the comfort was amazing. However the reason for my review is the excellent staff. They were kind polite helpful considerate and lovely people it was only a short flight from Malaga to Birmingham but we all said that we wished it was a longer flight they gave us drinks and the most lovely toasted sandwiches which were fantastic. Please pass on the thanks of the passengers and myself.
As a professional and frequent traveler on other airlines I had tried Insel Air and was choked by the poor service and treatment given to passengers on flight from Miami to Haiti on June 19 2012. An apology would be in order. Also all announcements are made in English there should be at least one Haitian hostess speaking both French and Creole. Hostesses on board were inexperienced. If Insel is not ready to service this line they should withdraw themselves until able to do so respectfully. Plane leaves full every time meaning that this route is profitable to the company. Hope my next review will be more positive.
There was a possible delay with the first leg but information was provided all the time. The service was extremely nice and polite. The aircrafts were comfortable but have some dust on the side of the seats by the windows. There was complementary basic wifi on the second leg.
I had a case dropped onto my head from the overhead baggage compartment by a steward. I bit my tongue and got swelling on my head. Very apologetic and I was offered a drink of water and an icepack however no follow up. I am a senior citizen and this could have caused serious injury.
Quito to Galapagos with LAN Airlines. Excellent service throughout. Had never encountered this airline before but would recommend highly. Lovely staff with excellent English and nice snacks. Both Quito and Galapagos airports are nice indeed with easy check in and plenty of space. Aircraft seats are leather and comfortable.
Sydney to Rome via Singapore. First time travelling business my seat was literally located within 50cm of the toilets at the rear of business class. During this long flight these toilets were continually in use not only by business class but also economy class and i was kept awake. I believe that these seats should not be offered as business class given there location. I would have rather spent the flight in economy class rather then being next to the toilets
Its absolutely worth any difference in fare price to fly a different airline. Today I got an email that my flight was canceled and that the only option was a flight a week later. Ive tried to call over a dozen times today and been disconnected each time. I gave my direct telephone number to call me back with the agent after being cut off the first two times and never got a call back. They wont confirm a new flight even on their website unless I buy a new ticket. Just needed up buying a return ticket on another airline. The worst air travel experience ever. Still have not received any response from them.
Manchester to Bangkok via Doha. Flights were perfect check in staff at Manchester appalling. Whilst checking in at business class a rude man interrupted and demanded a biz class sticker for his hand luggage he was an economy pax and proceeded to demand the attention of the check in woman who disregarded me. The woman then assured me that my Card details were in the system but no points have been credited but this is typically Manchester. Total disinterest and apathy compare this to Bangkok where attention is exemplary. The lounge they use in Manchester is woeful However in the air they are peerless and simply amazing. I have sent a complaint to the head office in Doha in the hope that this is addressed.
The flight was about 60 occupied. The economy class seats are just alright about the same as other airlines. The entertainment is nice screen is large. Plenty of moviesshows and documentaries. The cabin crew are responsive and quick to approach me when I pressed the bell for help. Meals are pretty good. I also bought the WiFi which cost 20 US dollars for the 2hr 40 mins flight. The service quality is about the same prepandemic. All in all Im satisfied with the trip overall.
LGWSPU onboard older Aircraft A319 with Recaro seating. Inflight catering sandwich and beverages provided but no inflight entertainment. Good luggage allowance of 23kg. Overall okay flight with courteous Croatian Flight Crew but small plane with limited legroom. Would fly them again at this reasonable price.
Had a chance to fly Canadian North for the first time from Calgary to Inuvik in the Northwest Territories. Check in friendly with no extra charge for my 4 bags. The aircraft was a Boeing 737 which replaced the Fokker100. Flight Attendants were friendly attentive. We were served a hot breakfast. Return flight equally as pleasant with a hot dinner this time and free wine. The service reminded me of the Wardair days. I only wish that they flew across lower Canada as well.
Both flights were very pleasant both departed a few minutes early and arrived early. The B777300 was the version with 10 across seating and extra rows added. I was surprised I did not find much difference with the older models. I am of average height and weight and leg roomseat width were perfectly acceptable for short haul. But I would not be keen to spend an overnight flight on these seats. Service was very good and attentive. The meals tasty and plentiful. Lots of different types of IFE programming. The only problem that seems now common with most airlines is that the price for this route has skyrocketed by about 50 since January
Very disappointing they are not reliable enough when it comes to luggage management. When checking it from Libreville to Johannesburg i had to take a connection flight from Lome same airline but they couldnt check the luggage to Johannesburg. I have been instructed to collect the luggage from Lome and check in again to Johannesburg. When arrive in Lome access was dined by immigration visa was required. I reported to the Asky agent in Lome and advised all in order my luggage was sent Johannesburg. Then when I arrived in Johannesburg no luggage was found and was lost in Lome. I had to book a hotel for the weekend as i couldnt do my job without the luggage. I was very unhappy the way Asky handled this issue as i emphasized my luggage was a priority
I flew Qantas Sydney to Melbourne return. The flights were punctual. The service was calm efficient and friendly. The meals in Business were hot and delicious. It looks like Qantas is back to its old self after the COVID disruption. Well done.
Awful experience. Little to no relevant communication. Cancelled a flight with no recourse. Absolutely no consideration for your time. You get what you pay for.
